    "note": " Molly complains that her husband \"never can explain a thing simply the way a body can understand.\" She uses the phrase \"a body\" to mean \"an ordinary person,\" but her language raises to a new level the novel's attention to experiencing the world in the flesh. If the example of Bloom shows how little Stephen lives in his own body, Molly's relentlessly corporeal anti-intellectuality goes Bloom one better.",
    "expandedNote": " Still trying to make sense of the unfamiliar word \"metempsychosis\" through familiar Anglo-Saxon physical actions—\"that word met something with hoses in it\"—she recalls how Bloom \"came out with some jawbreakers about the incarnation\" (i.e., reincarnation). His use of another synonym in Calypso, \"the transmigration of souls,\" roused her indignation: \"— O, rocks! she said. Tell us in plain words.\" Language, aided by Greek and Latin polysyllables, threatens to fly off into mists of abstraction just as souls threaten to fly out of their bodies. Perhaps it is no coincidence that, on the one other occasion when she uses the phrase \"a body,\" Molly thinks of such decoupling as a vexation: \"wouldnt that pester the soul out of a body.\" Souls belong in bodies, not floating free of them."

    "note": " When Bloom runs into an old friend of Molly's in whom he once took a romantic interest, a little whirlwind of Irish expressions erupts from Josie, most of them still current in Dublin speech: \"Go away,\" \"grand,\" \"on the baker's list,\" \"don't be talking,\" \"heartscalded,\" and, most strikingly, \"a caution to rattlesnakes.\" Bloom's own idiomatic contributions to the conversation are drawn from more standard English: \"in the pink,\" \"like a house on fire.\"",
    "expandedNote": "In a personal communication, Senan Molony observes that Josie's reaction to the news of Milly's employment in Mullingar, \"Go away!,\" is \"pure Irish idiom.\" Pronounced G’way, like the Australian G’day, it expresses \"amused amazement\" and means pretty much the opposite of what it says. Similarly, he observes that “Don’t be talking!” does not mean \"do not be talking,\" but something more like \"My goodness!\" or \"Do tell!\" Terence Dolan cites its appearance in Lestrygonians as an example of the Hiberno-English habit of putting \"be\" in front of progressive verbs. (\"Be starting your tea, otherwise it'll get cold.\") When Josie, after saying \"Go away!,\" exclaims, \"Isn't that grand for her?,\" she again sounds a distinctively Irish tone. Dolan gives the synonyms \"fine; splendid. 'That's a grand day!'\"\n Saying that people are \"on the baker's list,\" as Josie says of her children, means that they are well. Gifford attributes the expression to the ability to eat solid food, and Slote quotes from P. W. Joyce's English As We Speak It in Ireland: \"I am well and have recovered my appetite\" (109). When Bloom remarks that Molly is \"in the pink,\" he is saying something similar in a more standard English way. Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable defines it as meaning \"In excellent health\" but does not give the derivation that one might expect: a rosy complexion. Instead, the saying seems to have condensed longer ones like Shakespeare's \"the very pink of courtesy,\" Goldsmith's \"the very pink of perfection,\" and Burns' \"the pink o' womankind.\" The OED defines this sense of \"pink\" as \"The 'flower', or finest example of excellence; the embodied perfection (of some good quality).\" \n Bloom's description of Milly \"Getting on like a house on fire\" at the photographer's shop in Mullingar repeats an expression from England that has become commonplace in English-speaking lands as far away as America and South Africa. It clearly means \"very quickly,\" but Brewer's dictionary enlivens the cliché by suggesting an origin in vividly concrete sensory experience: \"The old houses of timber and thatch burned very swiftly.\" (Considering the great many thatch-roofed peasant homes that have been burned in Ireland during uprisings and evictions, it would be interesting to know if this expression gained a particular currency there!)\n Of Josie's declaration that Dennis Breen \"has me heartscalded,\" Gifford notes that this is \"A still-current Dublinism.\" Slote too identifies it as a Hiberno-English expression, and cites P. W. Joyce's comment that it means \"to experience 'a great vexation or mortification'.\" In 2013, Alphie McCourt, the younger brother of Frank McCourt, published a memoir called Heartscald.\n The vivid language that Josie uses of her husband two sentences earlier, \"He's a caution to rattlesnakes,\" is unfamiliar today but appears to have been standard fare in Joyce's time, judging by three uses that Molony has located in Irish and English newspapers dating from 1870 to 1901. The provenance and significance of the expression are open to debate, however. Of several possible meanings, all could be challenged on contextual grounds.\n One might surmise that \"He's a caution\" would mean \"He's a danger,\" especially given the mention of rattlesnakes. The full sense of Josie's statement, on this hypothesis, would be that not even dangerous animals are safe from her husband. But Joyce suggests only that Dennis Breen is eccentric, not dangerous; furthermore, I have not seen this sense of \"caution\" documented in reference works. Another possibility is less appealing to common sense but much better attested. Brewer writes that \"So-and-so's a caution\" can mean that \"he is odd in his ways, likely to do something unexpected, often with a quaint twist to it. The phrase is originally American.\" The OED too identifies as American slang the meaning \"Anything that staggers, or excites alarm, or astonishment; an extraordinary thing or person,\" and the American Heritage Dictionary offers the slang definition \"Someone or something that is striking or alarming.\" It is easy to imagine Josie making such a comment about her very odd husband. Still, saying that Dennis' behavior would astonish rattlesnakes, as Gifford does, sounds somehow implausible. \n Molony suggests a third meaning of \"He's a caution\" that is still current in Irish speech today: \"He's very funny,\" a wry equivalent of the American idiom \"He's a scream.\" This meaning would fit the ridicule that Dennis Breen attracts from Dubliners, though it is difficult to imagine why it would have been adapted to rattlesnakes, even in a spirit of comic hyperbole. (Are they even more impervious to laughing at human beings than other animals—a tougher audience?) It is almost as hard to imagine Josie inviting the ridicule. Would a loyal wife protective of her reputation (even one \"heartscalded\" by her long marriage to a lunatic) say that he deserves to be the butt of jokes?\n Nevertheless, this may well be the operative sense of the expression. An 1901 article in a Bristol, England newspaper applies it to the \"American Patter Comedian\" R. G. Knowles: \"the way he rolls off his latest wheezes is a caution to rattlesnakes.... the audience is kept in a boisterous roar all the time he is before them.\" An 1870 article in a Clonmel, Ireland paper describes a woman who made her way from New Ross to the poor-house in Clonmel seeking relief, noting that her \"volubility and scowling look were 'a caution to rattlesnakes'.\" At first glance the writer's use of this phrase might seem to imply that the woman's appearance was daunting (\"caution\" in the sense of \"a danger\"), but the anecdotes that follow emphasize her risibility. Asked how she came \"all the way from New Ross,\" she replies, \"I travelled it all.\" And why did she come? Why, \"to come in here (laughter).\" Whether intentionally or by accident, she is a natural comedian. Dennis Breen is, certainly by accident, a source of great comic relief to his fellow citizens."

    "note": " Echoes of Mozart's Don Giovanni in Ulyssesinclude not only the sexual excitement of Là ci darem la mano and the servile aspirations of Leporello's voglio but also Giovanni's passion for food and drink, which figures in climactic scenes at the end of both acts. In Lestrygonians, as Bloom walks away from Davy Byrne's feeling better for a sandwich and a glass of burgundy, he thinks of the powerful scene at the end of Act 2 in which a statue accepts an invitation to supper: \"Don Giovanni, a cenar teco / M'invitasti.\" And in Sirens, after an early supper at the Ormond, he recalls the feast that Giovanni throws for some peasants at the end of Act 1. Both references involve moral judgment. In the scene with the statue, food links Giovanni's riotous hedonism with the divine justice that Lorenzo da Ponte's libretto finally metes out to him. The earlier scene makes Bloom think of Irish peasants whostarved while aristocrats thrived.",
    "expandedNote": " In the Ormond dining room, Bloom hears Bob Cowley playing some Mozart on the bar's piano: \"Minuet of Don Giovanni he's playing now. Court dresses of all descriptions in castle chambers dancing. Misery. Peasants outside. Green starving faces eating dockleaves. Nice that is. Look: look, look, look, look, look: you look at us.\" The famished faces belong to Irish peasants gazing at a rich manor house, but Bloom's fantasy is triggered by hearing a minuet from the scene where Don Giovanni throws a grand festive ball in his house for some peasants. The largesse is purely exploitative: in an earlier scene Giovanni has told Leporello, \"Now prepare a great feast until the wine heats every head. If you find some girls in the square, bring them along too. Let the dancing be wild: here a minuet, here a folia, here an allemande will make them dance. And I meanwhile will hearken to another tune, making love to this one and that one. Ah! by tomorrow morning my list should be a dozen longer.\" \n In the ballroom scene that follows, he and Leporello urge the peasants celebrating the marriage of Masetto and Zerlina to enjoy the elegant refreshments that servants are handing out: \"Do take a drink, my fine young men.\" \"Ho! some coffee!\" \"Chocolate!\" \"Ices!\" \"Sweetmeats!\" Giovanni caresses Zerlina in front of her furious fiancé, dances with her, and then pulls her into a secluded room to rape her, but his effort is thwarted: she cries out, the partygoers break down the door, and Giovanni is nearly brought to justice. In this scene food and drink figure as images of, and accomplices in, Giovanni's predatory sexual pursuits. His amoral indifference to the welfare of his guests gives Bloom occasion to think of Irish aristocrats who flaunted their wealth in front of starving peasants.\n At the end of the opera, feasting again signifies rapacious, amoral appetite, but the feasting ends with the arrival of a man whom Giovanni murdered at the beginning of the opera. There, having attempted to seduce or more likely rape Donna Anna in her own house, Giovanni flees into the night streets. Confronted by her father, the Commendatore, he kills him. Much later, he walks home through a church graveyard with Leporello, laughing about his latest criminal exploits, and sees a statue of the Commendatore which, remarkably, speaks: \"You will be done laughing by dawn.\" The inscription on the statue's base delivers other ominous words: \"Here I await vengeance on the unholy man who drew me to my last step.\" \n The rake responds with flippant defiance, spoken in the language of food: \"That old fool! Tell him that tonight I'll expect him at supper with me (a cena meco).\" He bullies the terrified Leporello into relaying the message that \"my master...would like to sup with you (vorria con voi cenar).\" The statue nods assent, paralyzing Leporello with fear, but Giovanni mocks him and delivers the invitation himself: \"Speak, if you can: will you come to supper (a cena)?\" The statue replies: \"Yes.\" Two scenes later, it knocks at the mocker's door and sings the lines that Bloom remembers: \"Don Giovanni, you invited me to sup with you, and I have come (Don Giovanni, a cenar teco / m'invitasti, e son venuto).\"\n Bloom walks down the street in Lestrygonians humming these measures and \"prolonging in solemn echo the closes of the bars.\" Mozart's cadences for the Commendatore's basso voice are indeed solemn: four thunderous pairs of half-notes announcing that justice has arrived for Giovanni. Don Gio- VAN-NI drops an octave from D to D, a ce-nar TE-CO settles on an A in the middle, m'in-vi TAS-TI repeats the drop from D to D, and finally e son ve- NU-TO, the dramatic reply to the invitation, drops from the A to a resounding low A an octave down. After three hours of futile resistance to the seducer, an irresistible force has at last appeared.\n Bloom puzzles over one detail of the Italian text: \"What does that teco mean? Tonight perhaps.\" It means \"with you,\" but the rest of his English translation is accurate: \"Don Giovanni, thou hast me invited / To come to supper tonight, / The rum the rumdum.\" When the phrase \"a cenar teco\" recurs in Circe,it reprises Bloom's thought in Sirens about aristocratic oppression of peasants. Some \"IRISH EVICTED TENANTS\" join the chorus of his accusers, and he sits in a pillory whistling the music. Here, Bloom appears to identify with the wicked nobleman (as any musically inclined listener must!), adding Don Juan crimes to all the others that Circe makes him confess to.\n That justice comes for Giovanni at suppertime is no accident. The ballroom scene has associated his erotic appetites with feasting, and earlier in this climactic scene of Act 2 Giovanni has wolfed down food and wine while Leporello marvels: \"Ah, what a barbaric appetite! What giant mouthfuls!\" Giovanni's rapacious appetite makes him a giant among pygmies, a Gothic barbarian ravaging polite society. The jilted Donna Elvira enters, pouring out her romantic anguish one last time, only to have Giovanni mockingly invite her to have a bite with him: \"Long live women and good wine, the support and glory of mankind!\" \n When the Commendatore enters the same room moments later he countermands Giovanni's order for more food: \"Stay a moment. He who eats heavenly food does not graze on mortal food.\" He takes advantage of aristocratic etiquette to extend a reciprocal invitation: \"You invited me to supper: you know your duty. Tell me: will you come to sup with me?\" Never one to display fear, Giovanni agrees and shakes the statue's hand on the bargain. It proves to be an icy, unshakable death grip. Apprehended at last, and fiercely rejecting the Commendatore's demand to repent, he is torn by physical and spiritual tortures and sinks into a fiery chasm. Supper at the statue's place turns out to be a one-way trip to Hell. \n Da Ponte's association of food with destructive sexual predation seems well suited to the Homeric themes of Lestrygonians, but Bloom does not think such thoughts. Instead, Joyce makes the linkage more covertly throughout the novel. In Hades Bloom sees Boylan going into the Red Bank restaurant, perhaps to lunch on the oysters for which it was famous, and in Lestrygonians he recalls this sighting while reflecting on the supposed aphrodisiac properties of oysters. In Wandering Rocks, an hour before his appointment with Molly, Boylan enters a shop and arranges for a gift basket to be sent to Eccles Street, containing pears, peaches, a \"small jar\" of something, and a bottle of port wine. In Ithaca Bloom sees the remains of this wicker basket in his kitchen and finds flakes of Plumtree's potted meat in his bed. Between bouts of potting his own meat in Molly, Boylan has liberally stuffed his mouth.\n Joyce leaves it to Molly to spell out the implied connection between food and sexual appetite. The size, firmness, and stamina of Boylan's member make her wonder not only if he consumed oysters earlier in the day, but how many, and whether his herculean copulative feats may have left him hungry afterwards: \"he must have come 3 or 4 times with that tremendous big red brute of a thing he has...like iron or some kind of a thick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters I think a few dozen he was in great singing voice no I never in all my life felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must have eaten a whole sheep after.\" Boylan's enumerated orgasms echo Giovanni's enumerated sexual conquests. His appetite for food too seems similar.\n Molly's quantitative awe at Boylan's fucking and his eating, combined with her qualitative appreciation of his singing, suggest a symbolic equivalence with Don Giovanni. The linkage becomes undeniable if one asks what he was singing. In Ithaca Bloom has seen several recently smoked cigarettes on the piano in his parlor, not far from some sheet music for Love's Old Sweet Song. Boylan appears, then, to have accompanied Molly in a run-through of one of the two pieces scheduled for her upcoming concert. It is a solo, but her other number, Là ci darem la mano, is a duet. If this song too was rehearsed, with Boylan singing the baritone part to Molly's soprano, then he has taken the role of Don Giovanni at the piano before imitating him in the bedroom.\n Joyce found parts of da Ponte's libretto useful: the story of one man courting another man's wife, and the linkage of sexual appetite with food. Other themes—murder, vengeance, divine justice—evidently did not interest him much. Bloom's association of Giovanni's ball with starving Irish peasants shows deep hostility to aristocratic oppressors, and his humming of the \"M'invitasti\" bars suggests that he would like to see adultery punished. But Bloom is no commanding Commendatore, nor even a plucky Masetto. He fails to confront either Boylan or his wife about their planned adultery, and in Ithaca, after the deed is done, he rejects various forms of \"retribution\": \"Assassination, never, as two wrongs did not make one right. Duel by combat, no. Divorce, not now.\" Bloom supposes that adultery ranks lower than \"theft, highway robbery, cruelty to children and animals,\" and 28 other specified crimes—hardly enough cause to challenge a lusty nobleman to fight to the death. \n But one element in the opera's logic of divine judgment may have played some role in Joyce's imagination when he was writing Ulysses. The statue repeatedly demands that Giovanni \"Repent\" (\"Pentiti, cangia vita...Pentiti, scellerato...Pentiti\") and Giovanni repeatedly refuses (\"No, no, ch'io non me pento...No, vecchio infatuato...No!\").This authoritative religious demand for repentance, met with heroic secular defiance, finds an evocative analogue in the climactic passage of Circe where Stephen's dead mother demands that he repent (\"Repent, Stephen...Repent! O, the fire of hell!\") and Stephen batters back at the judgmental mirage (\"The ghoul! Hyena!...His noncorrosive sublimate! The corpsechewer! Raw head and bloody bones\"). For Joyce, a vengeful God's demand to repent one's human choices was the uncrossable bridge. Whether God exists or not, whether Catholic teachings are defensible or not, were questions that did not provoke him. But, like Giovanni, he could ill afford to renounce the momentous choice that had constituted him as a person and an artist. To the orthodox demand to Repent!, he said No!"

  "060044donkey": {
    "note": " When the gravediggers have laid Paddy Dignam to rest Bloom thinks, \"If we were all suddenly somebody else.\" Immediately the narrative adds, \"Far away a donkey brayed.\" It is a strange moment: the finality of death prompts an odd metaphysical fancy, and then an animal cries out as if in response. The cry makes Bloom recall some popular lore about donkeys, but one commentator notes that it may also play a symbolic role in the narrative. In a chapter stuffed with allusions to the underworlds of the Odyssey, the Aeneid, and the Inferno, the donkey's bray recalls the moment in Homer's Iliad when the horses of Achilles shed tears at the death of Patroclus.",
    "expandedNote": " § The donkey is a quintessentially Irish animal, grazing in paddocks all over the country, and two Irish beliefs pop up in response to this one. When he hears its bray Bloom thinks, \"Rain. No such ass. Never see a dead one, they say. Shame of death.\" Gifford notes \"the Irish superstition that a donkey braying at midday forecasts rain,\" which the meteorology of June 16 supports. Thornton quotes a saying from P. W. Joyce's English As We Speak It in Ireland: \"Three things no person ever saw: —a highlander's kneebuckle, a dead ass, a tinker's funeral.\" Commentary might well end with these proverbial commonplaces, but Bloom's attribution of human emotion to the animal, just after he ponders metempsychosis or metamorphosis, encourages another reading. \n § In a personal communication, Senan Molony points out a resemblance between Joyce's donkey and the two divine stallions of Achilles. The only other Greek who can fully manage these noble animals is Patroclus, and they reward his mastery with love. As fighting rages around his corpse, \"at a distance from the battle the horses of Aeacides had been mourning from the time they first learned of the falling of their charioteer\" (17.426-28, trans. Caroline Alexander). Nothing will persuade the horses to go back to the ships or rejoin the fighting. They stand apart, and \"hot tears from their lids flowed down to the ground as they wept with longing for their charioteer\" (437-39). Although immortal and nonhuman, they share the grief that devastates the combatants in Homer's tragic poem. Like these horses, the animal in Hades trumpets its dismay from \"Far away.\" Its braying suggests a possible answer to the question implied by Bloom's thought, \"If we were all suddenly somebody else\": could Patrick (Dignam) be Patroclus? If a humble donkey in some Glasnevin yard can play the part of god-given horses, then the poor Dublin drunkard laid to rest in a Glasnevin grave may stand in for a great Achaean warrior.\n § Joyce does not weave detailed symbolic parallels between Patrick and Patroclus as he does between Leopold and Odysseus. But just as Patroclus represents all of tragically mortal humanity in Iliad 17, so Dignam functions in Ulysses as a comically generalized figure of human mortality and the possibility of postmortal existence. Any teasing suggestion in Hades that in life Dignam reincarnated a Greek hero should probably be compared to the sly suggestion in Nausicaa that, after death, he has been reincarnated as a bat flitting about in the evening air near his Sandymount house. Bloom thinks of the bat as \"Like a little man in a cloak,\" \"Hanging by his heels in the odour of sanctity\" in the church belfry, and he calls it a \"Ba,\" evoking the part of the soul that ancient Egyptians thought lived on after death. In Circe metempsychosis turns Dignam into a beagle, a new life-form that rivals the donkey for antiheroic, comical independence."
  },
  "130004littleman": {
    "note": " The \"little bat\" that appears in the evening sky in Nausicaa is described naturalistically in Gerty's portion of the chapter: \"a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither, thither, with a tiny lost cry\"; \"something queer was flying about through the air, a soft thing, to and fro, dark\"; \"there was none to know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the evening to and fro.\" Bloom, however, imagines it as \"Like a little man,\" prompting thoughts of \"Metempsychosis,\" and the truncated form that the word takes four times in a paragraph and a half of his interior monologue, \"Ba,\" is an Egyptian term for a part of the human soul that lives on after death. These thoughts suggest, outlandishly, either that \"poor little Paddy Dignam\" has been reincarnated, or that his soul is hovering about his earthly haunts.",
    "expandedNote": " Gerty and Bloom sit on Sandymount Strand not far from 9 Newbridge Avenue, Sandymount where Paddy Dignam lived. Bloom has just visited this house on his mission of mercy to the family, and his thoughts about the bat seem strangely suited to the missing paterfamilias: \"Ba. What is that flying about? Swallow? Bat probably. . . . Metempsychosis.They believed you could be changed into a tree from grief. Weeping willow. Ba. There he goes. Funny little beggar. Wonder where he lives. Belfry up there. Very likely. Hanging by his heels in the odour of sanctity. Bell scared him out, I suppose. . . . Like a little man in a cloak he is with tiny hands. Weeny bones.\" Bloom has blurred the distinction between metempsychosis and metamorphosis in Calypso, and now he employs the concepts interchangeably, eliding reincarnation with the thought from Greek myth that \"you could be changed into a tree from grief.\"\n In the previous chapter, Cyclops, Dignam appeared in a passage where Theosophical ideas of the afterlife were parodied, commenting on living conditions in the astral realm and displaying continuing interest in earthly life. His final words concern footwear: \"Before departing he requested that it should be told to his dear son Patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to Cullen's to be soled only as the heels were still good. He stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made known.\" Nausicaa shows him comfortably wrapped in \"a cloak,\" but hanging in the belfry \"by his heels.\" It appears that the loss of his boots with the \"still good\" heels has left him shoeless in the afterlife. (Thanks to Senan Molony for noting this connection between the two chapters.)\n The ancient Egyptians theorized roughly half a dozen different components of the human soul. The most essential of these, the Ka and the Bâ, departed the body at death and could reunite to let the individual survive extinction. The Ka was the vital essence, spirit, or spark that animated the body, making it a living thing. The Bâ, which was typically depicted as a bird with a human head hovering over the body of the deceased, or flying away to join the Ka, was the individual personality or character. Food and drink offerings sustained the Ka, and priests performed rites to break the Bâ's attachment to its physical body, so that the two spiritual principles could unite once again in the afterlife.\n Another way of understanding the bat, then, is to see it as Paddy Dignam's soul hovering near his house in Sandymount, having not yet broken its attachments to this life. That reading is supported by the fact that, in other sentences in the same passage, Bloom ponders the little mammal more scientifically by thinking of birds: \"Ba. What is that flying about? Swallow? Bat probably. Thinks I'm a tree, so blind. Have birds no smell? . . . Ba. Again. Wonder why they come out at night like mice. They're a mixed breed. Birds are like hopping mice. What frightens them, light or noise? Better sit still. All instinct like the bird in drouth got water out of the end of a jar by throwing in pebbles. . . . Ba. Who knows what they're always flying for. Insects? That bee last week got into the room playing with his shadow on the ceiling. Might be the one bit me, come back to see. Birds too never find out what they say. . . . Nerve they have to fly over the ocean and back. Lots must be killed in storms, telegraph wires.\" The prominence of birds after each repeated mention of the \"Ba\" serves as a virtual illustration of the Egyptian soul-principle.\n The Egyptian Book of the Dead (there were many different ones, and individualized copies were placed in coffins and burial chambers) has been recognized as an influence on Finnegans Wake. Joyce acknowledged the influence and told Frank Budgen that the Wake could be regarded as his own Book of the Dead. That intertextual dialogue lies far beyond the scope of this Ulysses note, but it is worth observing that the later work does seem to perpetuate the interest in Egyptian soul-principles that began with Nausicaa. The Ondt says, \"Nor to Ba's berial nether, thon sloghard, this oldeborre's yaar ablong as there's a khul on a khat\" (415.31-32), referring not only to the Bâ but also, it seems, to the Ib or Ab (the spiritual \"heart\"), the Akh or Khu (an immortal, \"shining\" part), and the Khat (the physical body or flesh). \n For other appearances of Egyptian soul-principles in Finnegans Wake, see Clive Hart, \"His Good Smetterling of Entymology,\" A Wake Newslitter 4.1 (1977): 14-24."

  "010003mirrorrazor": {
    "note": " Mulligan emerges from the stairhead with the tools of his morning shaving ritual: a \"bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed.\" The fact that the mirror and razor lie \"crossed\" obliquely announces that Mulligan will soon be parodying a Catholic priest celebrating Mass. But these two objects also obliquely signal the tensions in the relationship between Mulligan and Stephen Dedalus—tensions that emerge in very concrete physical forms like the experience of seeing oneself as an object (the mirror) and the threat of bodily harm (the razor).",
    "expandedNote": " Later in the chapter, Mulligan will thrust the mirror in Stephen's face: \"Look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard!\" Stephen sees a poorly dressed, lice-infested body and thinks of a Robert Burns poem about the humbling effect of beholding oneself objectively, as others do. Mulligan has his own unflattering literary analogue for Stephen staring into the glass; he thinks of Oscar Wilde's sentences about the ugly and bestial Caliban seeing his face in a mirror. Stephen steps back from the mirror, and from these bitter self-reflections, to make the glass emblematic of the literary art that he hopes to practice: \"It is a symbol of Irish art. The cracked lookingglass of a servant.\" For Joyce, fiction had the duty to represent human reality accurately, and that meant depicting Irish society with all its paralyzing flaws. The first person to whom Ulysses holds up a mirror is Oliver St. John Gogarty, a.k.a. Mulligan.\n The razor too accretes associations as the chapter goes on. Mulligan repeatedly calls Stephen “Kinch” and explains the significance of his nickname: \"O, my name for you is the best: Kinch, the knife-blade.\" But knives are not associated only with the perverse jesuit who \"killed his mother\" and has \"something sinister\" in him. They also adhere to the man who shaves his face on top of the tower, and who \"lunges\" toward each of his companions in the room below \"a thick slice of bread, impaled on his knife.\" Mulligan is a medical student, and has seen corpses \"cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom.\" As Antinous and Claudius in the Homeric and Shakespearean analogues underlying the tower ménage, he carries concealed weapons, looking for opportunities to do harm. \n All of these associations resonate as Mulligan hooks \"his arm in Stephen's and walk[s] with him round the tower, his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he had thrust them,\" and as Stephen contemplates the exchange about mirrors that precedes the seemingly friendly linking of arms: \"Parried again. He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his. The cold steelpen.” The two men are locked in an embrace that is anything but genial. In symbols like mirrors and razors, and in actual physiological phenomena like flushed cheeks, their bodies tell the story of rising hatred."

  "020069streetshout": {
    "note": " Joyce may be thinking ironically of the hockey game when he has Deasy say that history \"moves to one great goal,\" and Stephen certainly is when, \"shrugging his shoulders,\" he says that God is \"A shout in the street.\" He is not simply dismissing the headmaster's religious belief, but suggesting that if divinity exists it must be understood in a radically immanent way: not waiting in the goalbox for humanity to finish its race, but surging through the excited bodies on the field.",
    "expandedNote": " At the end of Proteus, Stephen thinks of a God who does not simply become incarnate in mankind but cycles through all of material reality: \"God becomes man becomes fish becomes barnacle goose becomes featherbed mountain.\" Throughout the novel, he rejects the conventional vision of a beneficent God waiting outside of time to receive the good souls who have made it through life's meat-grinder, and instead imagines God as the meat-grinder. \n In Oxen of the Sun, God becomes literally a sound in the street, in the form of a deafening crack of thunder reproving Stephen for his blasphemy: \"A black crack of noise in the street here, alack, bawled back. Loud on left Thor thundered: in anger awful the hammerhurler. Came now the storm that hist his heart. And Master Lynch bade him have a care to flout and witwanton as the god self was angered for his hellprate and paganry.\"\n In Scylla and Charybdis Stephen thinks a good deal about this immanent God. He recalls his phrase from Nestor as he prepares his this-worldly Aristotelian arguments against the other-worldly Platonists: \"God: noise in the street: very peripatetic. Space: what you damn well have to see. . . . Hold to the now, the here, through which all future plunges to the past.\" This peripatetic God, he says, \"the lord of things as they are whom the most Roman of catholics call dio boia, hangman god, is doubtless all in all in all of us, ostler and butcher, and would be bawd and cuckold too but that in the economy of heaven, foretold by Hamlet, there are no more marriages.\"\n From this perspective Deasy is entirely wrong to say that \"The ways of the Creator are not our ways.\" The blog that displays the image of an eye reproduced here voices thoughts that may resemble Stephen's: \"If God is everything, then the divine includes rape, murder, cheating, war, destruction and the worst of everything we can think of. Some of the most ancient eastern religions assent to this view of the two-faced nature of God, the yin and yang.\"\n [2014] Thornton expresses lack of satisfaction with his efforts to locate literary analogues for Stephen's \"shout in the street.\" The book of Proverbs 1:20 reads, \"Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets . . . saying, How long, ye simple ones will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?\" Isaiah 42:2 says, \"He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street.\" And Stuart Gilbert cites Jupiter tonans, Jupiter the Thunderer, \"a phrase used several times by Ovid inMetamorphoses\" (James Joyce's Ulysses, 49). If indeed there is an allusion to any of these passages, it is hard to see what they might contribute to the understanding of Stephen's thought.\n [2015] In Mythic Worlds, Modern Words: Joseph Campbell on the Art of James Joyce (New World Library, 1993), Campbell observes that Stephen's insistence on the immanence of God, consonant with the Hindu tat tvam asi (you are that), implies not only a spatial indivisibility but also a temporal one. God is in the street rather than in Heaven, and he is also present in the present moment. Mr. Deasy argues that history is moving toward the revelation of God, \"which puts the day of meaning in the future, as though the moment now were but the means to another and better moment, a fulfilling moment, to come at the end of time, a sort of apocalyptic 'Day of God' or Marxian Revolution\" (75). Stephen, however, sees no need to wait, and he is \"going to experience this very day his own realization of the Presence through his meeting with Leopold Bloom, who will reveal compassion and transubstantiation\" (75)."

  "090001absentminded": {
    "note": " The \"absentminded beggar\" appears numerous times in Ulysses as a reference to Britain's second Boer War (1899-1902). This poem, written by Rudyard Kipling and set to music by Sir Arthur Sullivan, raised an immense amount of money for soldiers and their families.",
    "expandedNote": " Britain's rapid mobilization of reservists to wage the war brought terrible hardships on people: not only the risk of death or mutilation, but huge reductions in the wages men were earning, loss of support for their families back home, and often loss of their former jobs when they returned. Kipling wrote his patriotic poem in 1899 as part of a newspaper's campaign to raise money for the families. English men and women responded with an outpouring of humanitarian support, but to many Irish ears the song would have had a disagreeable timbre, since the war pitted the military might of the Empire against the Dutch citizen-soldiers of two south African republics—an unequal contest spurred by naked greed for the colonists' resources. Many Irish people sympathized with the nationalist aspirations of the Boer settlers and hoped that their resistance would weaken Britain's war-machine. \n Stephen clearly thinks of the song as beating the drums of war when he introduces it to the verbal textures of the book. As Mr. Best praises Mallarmé's prose poem about Shakespeare'sHamlet, Stephen silently reflects that Best makes no mention of the work's central point: Hamlet is a \"Sumptuous and stagnant exaggeration of murder.\" To drive home this point, he translates Mallarmé's \"Le Distrait\" (The Distracted or Absentminded One) as \"the absentminded beggar.\" The great playwright, in other words, was very much an Englishman.\n The Blooms reference the song less subversively. In Circe, Leopold coddles up to two nightmarish policemen by inventing a war history for himself: \"My old dad too was a J. P. I'm as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under general Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was mentioned in dispatches. I did all a white man could.\" Molly, who reveres the British armed forces, thinks of \"father being in the army and my singing the absentminded beggar and wearing a brooch for Lord Roberts.\" Ithaca sends up these reverent attitudes, however, by reciting a testimonial for the Wonderworker, \"the world's greatest remedy for rectal complaints,\" from an \"absentminded beggar\" in the army: \"What a pity the government did not supply our men with wonderworkers during the South African campaign! What a relief it would have been!\"\n The complete text of Kipling's jingoistic lyric is as follows:\n When you've shouted \"Rule Britannia\": when you've sung \"God Save the Queen,\"\n When you've finished killing Kruger with your mouth:\n Will you kindly drop a shilling in my little tambourine\n For a gentleman in khaki ordered South?\n He's an absent-minded beggar and his weaknesses are great:\n But we and Paul must take him as we find him:\n He is out on active service wiping something off a slate:\n And he's left a lot of little things behind him!\n Duke's son – cook's son – son of a hundred kings,\n (Fifty thousand horse and foot going to Table Bay!)\n Each of 'em doing his country's work (and who's to look after the things?)\n Pass the hat for your credit's sake, and pay – pay – pay!\n There are girls he married secret, asking no permission to,\n For he knew he wouldn't get it if he did.\n There is gas and coal and vittles, and the house-rent falling due,\n And it's rather more than likely there's a kid.\n There are girls he walked with casual, they'll be sorry now he's gone,\n For an absent-minded beggar they will find him,\n But it ain't the time for sermons with the winter coming on:\n We must help the girl that Tommy's left behind him!\n Cook's son – Duke's son – son of a belted Earl,\n Son of a Lambeth publican – it's all the same to-day!\n Each of 'em doing his country's work (and who's to look after the girl?)\n Pass the hat for your credit's sake, and pay – pay – pay!\n There are families by the thousands, far too proud to beg or speak:\n And they'll put their sticks and bedding up the spout,\n And they'll live on half o' nothing paid 'em punctual once a week,\n 'Cause the man that earned the wage is ordered out.\n He's an absent-minded beggar, but he heard his country's call,\n And his reg'ment didn't need to send to find him;\n He chucked his job and joined it – so the task before us all\n Is to help the home that Tommy's left behind him!\n Duke's job – cook's job – gardener, baronet, groom -\n Mews or palace or paper-shop – there's someone gone away!\n Each of 'em doing his country's work (and who's to look after the room?)\n Pass the hat for your credit's sake, and pay – pay – pay!\n Let us manage so as later we can look him in the face,\n And tell him what he'd very much prefer:\n That, while he saved the Empire his employer saved his place,\n And his mates (that's you and me) looked out for her.\n He's an absent-minded beggar, and he may forget it all,\n But we do not want his kiddies to remind him\n That we sent 'em to the workhouse while their daddy hammered Paul,\n So we'll help the homes that Tommy's left behind him!\n Cook's home – Duke's home – home of a millionaire –\n (Fifty thousand horse and foot going to Table Bay!)\n Each of 'em doing his country's work (and what have you got to spare?)\n Pass the hat for your credit's sake, and pay – pay – pay!"

  "030045absinthe": {
    "note": " In Proteus Stephen thinks of the scent of \"froggreen wormwood\" in Parisian cafes and shortly afterward recalls Kevin Egan \"sipping his green fairy as Patrice his white.\" The references are to absinthe, an intensely alcoholic (as much as 75% ABV) and allegedly hallucinogenic anise-flavored liquor that was popular among artists and writers in Paris in the early 20th century. Later, in Oxen of the Sun, Stephen culminates a long day of drinking with some staggering draughts of absinthe.",
    "expandedNote": " For much of the 20th century absinthe had a reputation for mind-altering and mind-damaging properties, and many countries banned its sale soon after the time represented in Ulysses. (France joined the bandwagon in 1914, but the United Kingdom never outlawed the drink, probably because not many people consumed it on the islands.) Most of the charges against absinthe were ridiculously exaggerated, exploited by campaigns of demonization similar to the \"reefer madness\" campaign that succeeded in outlawing marijuana in the United States. The \"wormwood\" in the liquor (leaves and flowers of the grand wormwood plant, Artemisia absinthium) has never been shown to be hallucinogenic, addictive, or poisonous, and it may have medicinal properties. Nevertheless, many people at the turn of the 20th century believed that absinthe had powerful effects beyond those of the high alcohol content.\n Some absinthes are greenish, because of the presence of botanicals and/or artificial coloring. Others are clear. When mixed with water, botanical essences come out of alcoholic solution to produce a cloudy look called the louche, freeing up some of the herbal flavors in the spirit. Fin de siècle French bars usually served absinthe in this way, dripping water over a sugar cube and into a glass until the alcohol was considerably diluted. \n The opalescence probably gave rise to the nickname that absinthe enjoyed in Joyce's time: la fée verte, the green fairy. \"Sipping his green fairy as Patrice his white\" may imply that Kevin's son drinks the white louche absinthe shown in the photograph (grammatically, \"white\" must modify \"fairy\"), or perhaps, as Gifford infers, the reference is to Patrice's lait chaud mentioned earlier in Proteus (with \"as\" meaning \"in the same manner as\"). Later in the paragraph about Kevin Egan Stephen thinks, \"His breath hangs over our saucestained plates, the green fairy's fang thrusting between his lips.\"\n Yet once more in this paragraph of Proteus, absinthe makes an appearance as someone says or thinks, \"Green eyes, I see you. Fang, I feel,\" apparently connecting the treacherous green fairy to \"the green-eyed monster,\" Iago's description of jealousy in Shakespeare's Othello. Egan has been talking before these two sentences, but his speech concerns young women giving massages to lascivious men. It would be very strange for him to interrupt these thoughts to apostrophize absinthe. Furthermore, it was Stephen who contemplated the fairy's fang thrusting between Egan's lips earlier in the paragraph, and only Stephen has the literary proclivities to connect the green fairy of Paris to Iago's monster. So it seems reasonable to assume that Stephen's internal monologue here breaks into Egan's spoken dialogue. The Shakespearean allusion will return in Circe.\n It is probably not an artistic accident that, when the young men leave the maternity hospital for Burke's pub at the end of Oxen of the Sun, just before the hallucinogenic extravagances of Circe, Stephen chooses this drink for his final alcoholic indulgence. After offering to treat everyone to drinks (\"Query. Who's astanding this here do? Proud possessor of damnall\"), and asking what the others want, he declares his own preference: \"Absinthe for me, savvy?\" On the second round, all the others join him: \"Landlord, landlord, have you good wine, staboo? Hoots, mon, a wee drap to pree. Cut and come again. Right. Boniface! Absinthe the lot. Nos omnes biberimus viridum toxicum diabolus capiat posterioria nostria.\" Gifford translates Stephen's Latin: \"We will all drink green poison, and the devil take the hindmost.\" \n In Circe, Bloom tries to mollify the soldiers by explaining why Stephen is talking so wildly: \"He doesn't know what he's saying. Taken a little more than is good for him. Absinthe. Greeneyed monster.\""

  "010020ancientgreek": {
    "note": " Stephen Dedalus may seem an “absurd name” from the perspective of normal Irish experience, but from a literary perspective it is easily one of the most meaningful, over-determined signifiers ever attached to a fictive person. Mulligan is probably referring to his unheard-of family name; but both Stephen and Dedalus are “ancient Greek,” and both reflect the ancient Greek practice of using names to indicate functions or attributes.",
    "expandedNote": " Daidalos (Latin Daedalus) means “cunning workman,” “fine craftsman,” or “fabulous artificer” (this last phrase comes from A Portrait of the Artist, and Joyce repeats it Scylla and Charybdis). Stephanos means crown or wreath, and carries associations with the garlands that were draped over the necks of bulls marked for sacrifice. The first Christian martyr was named St. Stephen, probably because of this association with sacrifice.\n Dedalus was a legendary artisan whose exploits were narrated by ancient poets from Homer to Ovid. A Portrait opens with an epigraph from Ovid’s Metamorphoses: et ignotas animum dimittit in artes, “and he applies his mind to unknown arts.\" It concludes with a secular prayer: “Old father, old artificer, stand me now and ever in good stead.” Both are references to Daedalus. Between these bookends, the autobiographical persona who has inherited the craftsman’s name discovers his vocation as a literary artist and begins to prepare himself for writing a great work of Irish art. He hopes one day “to forge in the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race.” The Portrait, then, presents Stephen as potentially an artificer comparable to the legendary Greek craftsman, his spiritual father. Whether he will actually become such an artist is a question that Ulysses raises but does not definitively answer. It is a possibility that has not yet become actual. \n Daedalus was famed for three particular creations, one of which comments upon Stephen’s son-like combination of potential and immaturity. Ovid tells the story of how the craftsman, trapped on Crete by King Minos, fashioned two pairs of artificial wings to escape his island prison—one for himself and one for his son Icarus. He warned Icarus not to fly too high, lest the heat of the sun melt the wax attaching the feathers to the artificial wings. Carried away with the joy of flight, Icarus forgot his father’s warning, flew too close to the sun, and fell to his death in the sea. If Stephen is more like the son than the father, then his efforts to fly will be marked by disastrous failure more than triumph. \n Both A Portrait and Ulysses confirm this expectation. The earlier novel establishes a recurring pattern of triumph followed by failure, flight followed by descent. It ends on a high note, with Stephen resolving to “fly by” the nets thrown at the soul in Ireland “to hold it back from flight.” He looks at birds in flight and thinks “of the hawklike man whose name he bore soaring out of captivity on osierwoven wings.” He prepares to go “Away! Away!” (to Paris), thinking of kindred souls “shaking the wings of their exultant and terrible youth.” But Ulysses finds him back in Dublin, picking seaweed off his broken wings. He is unachieved and unrecognized as an artist, unloved and unwed in a book whose subject is sexual love, and soon to be unhoused and unemployed. \n In Proteus Stephen imagines his father Simon learning that he has been hanging out in the run-down house of his Aunt Sally and responding with contemptuous derision: \"Couldn't he fly a bit higher than that, eh?\" In Scylla and Charybdis he thinks, “Fabulous artificer. The hawklike man. You flew. Whereto? Newhaven-Dieppe, steerage passenger. Paris and back. Lapwing. Icarus. Pater, ait. Seabedabbled, fallen, weltering. Lapwing you are. Lapwing be.” The cry of Pater (“Father”) identifies him with Daedalus’ much-loved son. “Lapwing” identifies him with a low-flying, non-soaring bird that also figures in the mythology of Daedalus. In Ovid Renewed: Ovidian Influences on Literature and Art from the Middle Ages to the twentieth century, edited by Charles Martindale (Cambridge UP, 1988), Niall Rudd notes that \"in spring the bird gives an odd aerobatic display, climbing upwards and then plunging down, rolling and twisting, apparently out of control\" (50).\n The myth of Dedalus and Icarus, then, becomes one more ancient Greek template in Ulysses for Stephen’s halting growth into manhood, paralleling the stories of Hamlet and Telemachus. As in those stories, there are as many grounds for hope as for despair. In Scylla and Charybdis, Stephen recalls a dream he had the night before: “Last night I flew. Easily flew. Men wondered.” Circe literalizes this hopeful fantasy, having Stephen assert, “No, I flew. My foes beneath me. . . . Pater! Free!” while Simon Dedalus, playing the artistic father, “swoops uncertainly through the air, wheeling, uttering cries of heartening, on strong ponderous buzzard wings.” \n Daedalus’ second famous creation (moving backward rather than forward through his life) was the Labyrinth that he constructed beneath the palace of Knossos to house the half-man half-bull Minotaur. (Scholars speculate that the myth of the Labyrinth may have been inspired by the elaborate floor plan of the actual palace, whose size and complexity were extraordinary.) If any work of twentieth century fiction, or indeed of world literature in any age, can be compared to a labyrinth, it is Ulysses—with the difference that, whereas Theseus had one thread to retrace his steps through the dangerous maze, Joyce’s reader encounters countless connections between widely separated parts of the book. Joyce seldom employed the image of the labyrinth, however. (In the Linati schema, it appears as the \"technique\" of Wandering Rocks.)\n Daedalus’ first work involved cattle, in what Oxen of the Sun calls the fable \"of the Minotaur which the genius of the elegant Latin poet has handed down to us in the pages of his Metamorphoses.\" The artificer helped Pasiphae, the queen of Crete, to satisfy her desire for a particularly good-looking bull by constructing a hollow artificial cow that allowed the bull’s penis to enter both it and her. The fruit of this copulation was the Minotaur. Bulls were central to Minoan civilization; it worshiped them, and young men and women performed a spectacular ritual of vaulting over them by gripping their horns. Minos himself sprang from the union of Europa with the white bull in which Zeus visited her, and Poseidon inflicted Pasiphae’s lust upon her as punishment for Minos’ refusal to sacrifice a particularly magnificent sea-born bull to the god. \n Joyce alludes to the racy story of Pasiphae in Scylla and Charybdis, when Stephen’s list of sexual taboos includes “queens with prize bulls,” and in Circe, when he thinks again of the woman “for whose lust my grandoldgrossfather made the first confessionbox.” He may also be alluding to it obliquely in Oxen of the Sun, when bulls and sex again get mixed up with religion and confession: “maid, wife, abbess, and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the four fields of all Ireland . . . and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on his hind quarters to show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bulls’ language and they all after him.” \n These particular passages may only characterize Stephen by contrast (as someone who rejected the priesthood), but he is repeatedly associated with cattle in general and bulls in particular, beginning with the first sentence of A Portrait of the Artist: “Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming down along the road and this moocow that was coming down along the road met a nicens little boy named baby tuckoo.” Later in Portrait the cries of some swimming boys—“Come along, Dedalus! Bous Stephanoumenos! Bous Stephaneforos! . . . Stephanos Dedalos! Bous Stephanoumenos! Bous Stephaneforos!”—make him briefly a Greek bull, ox, or cow (Bous is gender-indeterminate). His agreement in Nestor to carry Mr Deasy’s letter to two newspaper editors makes him think, “Mulligan will dub me a new name: the bullockbefriending bard”—a phrase which floats through his mind in two later episodes. In Oxen, the two motifs come together: “I, Bous Stephanoumenos, bullockbefriending bard, am lord and giver of their life. He encircled his gadding hair with a coronal of vineleaves, smiling at Vincent. That answer and those leaves, Vincent said to him, will adorn you more fitly when something more, and greatly more than a capful of light odes can call your genius father.” \n As Stuart Curran has observed in \"'Bous Stephanoumenos': Joyce's Sacred Cow,\" JJQ 6:2 (Winter 1969): 163-70, Stephen's friends in Portrait seem to be ridiculing him as \"something of a blockhead who refuses to join their fun,\" but the verb stephanon means \"to encircle or wreathe,\" and the noun stephanos means \"wreath or crown,\" so his very name identifies Stephen as \"a hero, a youth singled out from the mass of his countrymen\" (163). He and Vincent play upon the notion that great poets are crowned with laurel wreaths—with Vincent observing that he has not yet deserved such accolades, having written only a handful of short lyrics. But the root sense of his name also identifies him as a sacrificial victim, since the garlanded oxen of ancient Greece were marked for slaughter, and (as Curran also observes) the Greek passive verb stephanomai can mean “to be prepared for sacrifice” (167). Thus the “ancient Greek” significance of stephanos forms an intelligible link to the other figure who is usually regarded as a basis of the name Joyce chose for his autobiographical persona: St. Stephen Protomartyr, the first of the Christian martyrs."

  "150007aconite": {
    "note": " In Ithaca Bloom thinks of his father's death in 1886 from aconite poisoning. In Circe, as he reflects on \"Patriotism, sorrow for the dead, music,\" and paternity (the “future of the race”), he mentally reenacts his father’s suicide, imagining the drawn blinds of the hotel room in Ennis, a suicide letter, and the soft breaths before asphyxiation. He imagines that Rudolph committed suicide by ingesting a “few pastilles of aconite.” Pastilles are small candies or lozenges often used to deliver doses of medicine. Aconite is a poisonous plant of the buttercup family, but it was used medicinally as an herbal remedy for a wide-range of symptoms including fever, constipation, anxiety, and sciatica.",
    "expandedNote": " According to the Encyclopedia Britannica of Joyce’s time, aconite is in some varieties one of the deadliest substances on Earth, and can be lethal with minimal exposure. According to the Review of Natural Products, as little as 2 mg of pure aconite or 1 g of the plant may cause death from paralysis of the respiratory center or heart. When used medicinally, aconite is administered with extreme caution. Ithaca says that Rudolph was being treated by \"aconite, resorted to by increasing doses of grains and scruples as a palliative of recrudescent neuralgia.\" The episode also suggests that the fatal dose came in the form of a lotion, not lozenges: Rudolph has died \"in consequence of an overdose of monkshood (aconite) selfadministered in the form of a neuralgic liniment composed of 2 parts of aconite liniment to 1 of chloroform liniment.\" \n Aconite is known by many names, including wolfsbane, devil’s hood, queen of poisons, monkshood, and women’s bane. It has mythical connections to Hercules, Medea and Circe, among others, but is particularly famed for being a lovers’ poison. In many stories women and men regularly ingest aconite in order to kill their lovers instantly, with a single loving touch. It was sometimes called thelyphonon, meaning “women’s bane” or “women murdering” (Copley 425). The influential Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder thought that women were more susceptible to the poison, stating that “if the sexual parts are but touched by it” the female will “not survive a single day” (trans. John Bostock and Henry T. Riley, 1855). Similarly, English botanist John Parkinson, in his Theatrum Botanicum: The Theater of Plants (1640), says it “speedily killeth even within a day” if “put into the secret parts of females” (318). \n In an essay titled “The M’Intosh Murder Mystery,” literary critic John Gordon speculates that because Rudolph intermittently ingested aconite for his sciatica pain, and assumedly had sexual relations with his wife near the time of at least one of those ingestions, he subsequently developed a guilty suspicion that he poisoned his own wife through sexual contact with a toxin particularly deadly to women. Perhaps while Leopold Bloom reflects on “poor papa” and “the love that kills” in Hades, he unintentionally mimics the guilty conscience of his dead father, who believed he caused his wife’s death.\n Gordon cites the toxic link between the mysterious MacIntosh man and Rudolph Bloom as yet another example of their similarity by referring to the MacIntosh man’s belief (indicated in Oxen of the Sun) that he had “a deposit of lead in his penis.\" Lead, like aconite, is a deadly poison, and if ingested can cause insanity. Gordon observes that the MacIntosh man and Rudolph are both mourning widowers. Maybe the MacIntosh man, like Rudolph, felt that his poisoned penis caused the death of the woman whom Oxen of the Sun calls his “maiden all forlorn.” Perhaps, as Gordon suggests, the similarities between the MacIntosh man and Rudolph Bloom are not coincidence, but the anonymous wandering figure of the MacIntosh man is actually an unrecognizable, ghostly Rudolph Bloom."

    "note": " \"Adam court\" is a short dead-end pedestrian alley opening off of Grafton Street to the east. Today it is dedicated to drinking and musical entertainment. In Joyce's time it was not much different.",
    "expandedNote": " Lestrygonians shows Bloom passing the alley on his way down Grafton Street: \"Mr Bloom, quickbreathing, slowlier walking, passed Adam court.\" He thinks,\"this is street here middle of the day Bob Doran’s bottle shoulders. On his annual bend, M'Coy said. They drink in order to say or do something or cherchez la femme.\" The syntax suggests that Bloom may be thinking of some other time when he saw Doran lurching into Adam Court, but some sentences soon afterward make it seem more likely that he has spotted Doran's form in the crowd and now confirms the sighting: \"Yes. Thought so. Sloping into the Empire. Gone. Plain soda would do him good. Where Pat Kinsella had his Harp theatre before Whitbred ran the Queen's.\"\n In 1904 the Empire Buffet was a pub and restaurant at 1-3 Adam Court, on the Grafton Street corner. A 1919 advertisement in the Freeman's Journal shows that it remained at that address through the war years. Bloom thinks back to a time in the 1890s when there was a cabaret called the Harp Musical Hall at the same address. In recent years the music has returned. From the 1990s until April 2019 the building housed Lillie's Bordello, a glitzy upscale nightclub with music and dancing where celebrities regularly congregated. Now the space is occupied by Lost Lane, another nightclub with a less exclusive appeal and an emphasis squarely on live music."

  "010039mightymother": {
    "note": " Starting with Mulligan's proclamation in Telemachus that the sea is \"Our mighty mother!\" (a phrase confoundingly close to the \"great sweet mother\" which he has just borrowed from Swinburne), the novel glances often at the Irish intellectual George Russell, who was known by his pen (and brush) name \"A.E.\" Russell was a painter, poet, playwright, journalist, esoteric spiritualist, and promoter of cooperative agricultural economics. As editor of the Irish Homestead he published several of Joyce's short stories but then soured on his fiction, and Joyce retaliated by presenting him as a faintly ridiculous figure. But the mystical spirituality signified by \"AE\" is a strong presence in Ulysses.",
    "expandedNote": " Born to poor Protestant parents in 1867 in Lurgan, County Armagh, and educated at several art schools in Dublin in the 1880s, George William Russell took the name Æ (he liked the dipthong, but publishers obliged him to break it up) from an ancient word charged with spiritual suggestions. The Greek aion and its Latin transliteration aeon could refer to the vital force of life, or alternatively to periods of time, whether a delimited age (as in \"medieval,\" the medium aevum), an immense stretch (as in the English \"eon\"), or something utterly beyond measurement (Plato used it in talking about the world of Ideas, and the Greek writers of the New Testament in their references to eternal life). The evocation of both vitality and eternity seems well suited to Russell's fusion of agricultural and spiritual ideals, but he had still more precise meanings in mind.\n He settled on the pseudonym in his late teens, and attributed the choice to pure intuition. In the chapter on \"Imagination\" in A Candle of Vision (1918), he wrote that \"The word 'Aeon' thrilled me, for it seemed to evoke by association of ideas, moods and memories most ancient, out of some ancestral life where they lay hidden; and I think it was the following day that, still meditative and clinging to the word as a lover clings to the name of the beloved, a myth incarnated in me.\" In his Memoir of A.E. (1937), Russell's acolyte John Eglinton (William Kirkpatrick Magee) tells a similar story: \"He began to paint his visions, and had been attempting an ambitious series of pictures on the history of man, in one of which he 'tried to imagine the apparition in the Divine Mind of the idea of the Heavenly Man', when, as he lay awake considering what legend he should write under the picture, something whispered to him 'call it the Birth of Aeon'. Next day the entire myth 'incarnated in me as I walked along the roads near Armagh'.\" \n Russell reported that, afterward, the mystical whisper found scholarly confirmation. In December 1886 he wrote to fellow esoterist Carrie Rea that \"I was thinking of what would be the sound for the most primeval thought I could think and the word “aön” passed into my head. I was afterwards surprised at finding out that the Gnostics of the Christian Era called the first created being 'Æons' and that the Indian word for the commencement of all things is Aom.\" In A Candle of Visionhe wrote that, soon after dreaming up the word, \"I went into the Library at Leinster House and asked for an art journal. I stood by a table while the attendant searched for the volume. There was a book lying open there. My eye rested on it. It was a dictionary of religions, I think, for the first word my eye caught was 'Aeon' and it was explained as a word used by the Gnostics to designate the first created beings. I trembled through my body.\" \n These quotations come from a 10 April 2017 article on Russell by Brian Showers in the Irish Times. Intrigued by the mention of \"a dictionary of religions,\" Showers searched in the holdings of the National Library, which in the late 1880s moved from Leinster House into Sir Thomas Deane's grand new building next door. He found only two works that fit the description. One contained no entry for Æon, but the other, Cassell's 1887 Dictionary of Religion edited by the Rev. William Benham, defines it as \"An 'eternal being'; the name given to the 'emanations' from the Supreme Being in the Gnostic system.\" Skeptics may scoff at Russell's contention that he divined the term and its meaning naively and only later found his intuition ratified in a reference work, but the existence of this book does speak to his intellectual honesty.\n AE evokes, then, mankind's primeval state of perfection, manifested in an original Neoplatonic emanation from the One, Absolute, Divine reality. In Proteus Stephen thinks of a similar concept, the Adam Kadmon which late 19th century spiritualists found in the Kabbalah. Still later in the novel, an advertisement for Dr. John Alexander Dowie introduces an American revivalist who preaches the gospel that all men and women contain Christ within themselves. These immensely optimistic spiritual messages stand in stark contrast to the puritanical, judgmental, repressive Catholicism that dominated Irish culture in 1904, which no doubt explains their presence in Ulysses.An apostate, Joyce used the novel to open his mind to contrary influences: mystical, Gnostic, Eastern. But as a westerner still fond of Catholicism's intellectual rigor he also subjected ideas like Russell's to mocking skepticism.\n Russell saw divine perfection not only in humanity but in all the works of nature. Thornton cites many appearances of the phrase \"mighty mother\" in his writings, noting that it refers to \"the physical world, or, more specifically, the Earth.\" Gifford defines it as “nature in its spiritual aspect.” Russell recommended the spirituality that could be gained by living close to the land, and in many of his paintings he represented the uplifting spiritual power of the seacoast. He also painted scenes of woodlands, agricultural fields, and midland bogs, most of them with human figures in the landscape. In Scylla and Charybdis, Joyce represents him as saying that \"The movements which work revolutions in the world are born out of the dreams and visions in a peasant's heart on the hillside. For them the earth is not an exploitable ground but the living mother.\" \n The goddess worship appears not to have rubbed off on Stephen. In Proteus he recalls Mulligan's paean to the \"mighty mother\" as he contemplates a rumpled old woman on the beach—a midwife, he supposes, whose handbag contains \"A misbirth with a trailing navelcord.\" In Scylla and Charybdis, where Russell is one of several men listening to his Shakespeare theory, Stephen's antagonism becomes still more evident. Among many other mocking criticisms of Russell's spirituality he thinks, of him and his fellow Theosophists, \"Streams of tendency and eons they worship.\" He trivializes the cryptic dipthong by playing with the fact that he has borrowed a pound from Russell and not repaid it: \"A.E.I.O.U.\" \n Russell appears in many guises in the novel: as a pompously dogmatic spiritualist; as editor of the newspaper where Stephen seeks to place Mr. Deasy's letter; as a dramatist whose 1902 play Deirdre featured the mythic figure ofMananaan MacLir; and as a prominent figure on the literary scene, esteemed by aspiring young writers. In Lestrygonians Bloom recalls that Lizzie Twigg, one of the women who answered his ad for a \"smart lady typist to aid gentleman in literary work,\" informed him that \"My literary efforts have had the good fortune to meet with the approval of the eminent poet A. E. (Mr Geo. Russell).\" Before Russell became Æ he signed his name Geo. W. Russell.\n This version of his name appears a second time in Lestrygonians when Bloom sees Russell dressed in coarse country cloth, pushing a bicycle, and spouting esoteric obscurities to an acolyte:\n — Of the twoheaded octopus, one of whose heads is the head upon which the ends of the world have forgotten to come while the other speaks with a Scotch accent. The tentacles... \n They passed from behind Mr Bloom along the curbstone. Beard and bicycle. Young woman. \n And there he is too. Now that's really a coincidence: second time. Coming events cast their shadows before. With the approval of the eminent poet, Mr Geo. Russell. That might be Lizzie Twigg with him. A. E.: what does that mean? Initials perhaps. Albert Edward, Arthur Edmund, Alphonsus Eb Ed El Esquire. What was he saying? The ends of the world with a Scotch accent. Tentacles: octopus. Something occult: symbolism. Holding forth. She's taking it all in. Not saying a word. To aid gentleman in literary work.\n His eyes followed the high figure in homespun, beard and bicycle, a listening woman at his side. \n Many people in 1904 were asking Bloom's question about the meaning of \"A.E.\" Gifford notes that, according to one Dublin joke, it stood for Agricultural Economist. The point was that Russell, since the late 1890s, had been working for Horace Plunkett's organization of rural cooperatives. He rode his bicycle around rural Ireland promoting the ideas of the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society, and in the early 1900s he became editor of the society's newspaper, the Irish Homestead. When Stephen asks Russell to print Deasy's letter in the paper, in Scylla and Charybdis, he silently derides it as \"the pigs' paper.\" It was far more than that: the paper represented strong nationalist convictions and sought practical solutions to Ireland's dire economic problems."

  "070000aeolus": {
    "note": " Episode 7, \"Aeolus,\" starts at about noon. With the morning hours having been narrated twice, time now moves forward more or less uninterrupted. Bloom shows up in this chapter, back in town from his visit to the cemetery, and somewhat later Stephen does too, in from the seashore, but the action does not center on them as in earlier chapters, and they never interact. As in Wandering Rocks three chapters later, the urban setting itself—the bustle around Sackville Street and inside the nearby newspaper offices—seems as important as the thoughts and feelings of the main characters. Amid all the bustle nothing really happens, except for a little mercantile enterprise on Bloom's part and a little artistic enterprise on Stephen's that both manage to seem inconsequential in context, though they are not. The resulting sense of busy stasis is heightened by an underlying allusion to the Homeric story of winds driving Odysseus' ships nearly home and then back out to sea again. This buried literary analogue generates numerous verbal figures of wind and frustrated journeying. It also resonates with two major thematic preoccupations in the chapter: the art of rhetoric, and the sense of futility in Dublin, capital city of an imperial property.",
    "expandedNote": " After recounting his struggle with the Cyclops at the end of Book 9, Odysseus turns at the beginning of Book 10 to the month he spent on a floating island ruled by Aeolus, whom Zeus put in charge of the winds. At his departure, he says, Aeolus gave him a leather bag containing all the disruptive winds that might blow him off course, leaving Zephyr, the gentle west wind, to blow the ships east toward Ithaca. After nine days of steady sailing, Ithaca came in view and Odysseus, who had been at the tiller the whole time, allowed himself to fall asleep. His men, suspicious that the sack held treasure for him alone, opened it, and the unruly winds blew the ship all the way back to Aeolus' island. When Odysseus asked for assistance once more, Aeolus roared for him to \"Get out!,\" saying that a man so unlucky must be hated by the gods.\n In Joyce's reworking of this brief episode, Bloom stands in for Odysseus and editor Myles Crawford plays the part of Aeolus. When Bloom first enters the office of the Evening Telegraph and uses Crawford's telephone to track down a man who may agree to renew an ad in the paper, the productive enterprise meets with the editor's wry approval : \"— Begone! he said. The world is before you.\" But when Bloom calls the office from his travels, Crawford is busy bragging about a past journalistic triumph and snarls, \"Tell him to go to hell.\" Some time later, as Crawford is leaving the newspaper building, Bloom catches up to him and asks him to help secure the renewal by putting a short paragraph about Keyes' business in the paper. \"— Will you tell him he can kiss my arse? Myles Crawford said throwing out his arm for emphasis. . . . — He can kiss my royal Irish arse, Myles Crawford cried loudly over his shoulder. Any time he likes, tell him.\" \n Homer's story informs Joyce's in other ways. The motif of an interrupted or frustrated journey recurs late in the chapter when the busy network of trams around Nelson's pillar stands paralyzed by an electrical outage: \"At various points along the eight lines tramcars with motionless trolleys stood in their tracks.\" Also late in the chapter, J. J. O'Molloy responds to an inspiring speech about Moses by recalling his Odysseus-like failure to enter the land of Canaan after leading the Israelites toward it for forty years: \"And yet he died without having entered the land of promise.\" Stephen later appropriates this detail, naming his little story A Pisgah Sight of Palestine. The impression of paralysis and futility limned by these narrative gestures permeates the chapter, linking to the stagnant careers of O'Molloy and Professor MacHugh, the feckless sycophancy of Lenehan, the drunken stupor of Crawford, the lack of work being accomplished in the editor's office, the ignominious failure of various insurrections, and the millennial frustration of hopes for an Irish nation.\n In compensation for this litany of failures, the chapter offers one great Irish accomplishment: ceaseless, brilliant, truculent talk. This feature too draws inspiration from Homer, because the blasts of hot air issuing from human mouths are imaged several times as winds—an old conceit, as can be seen in the first two images here. Bloom makes the connection when Crawford rebuffs him: \"A bit nervy. Look out for squalls. All off for a drink. Arm in arm. Lenehan's yachting cap on the cadge beyond. Usual blarney.\" He similarly scorns the purple prose of Dan Dawson's speech: \"High falutin stuff. Bladderbags.\" Professor MacHugh agrees: \"Enough of the inflated windbag!\" Through this lens even the words of a great political orator like Daniel O'Connell, rousing unimaginably vast crowds to action, look like wasted breath. Stephen thinks of them as \"Gone with the wind. . . . The tribune's words, howled and scattered to the four winds. A people sheltered within his voice. Dead noise.\"\n This concern with the forceful but ephemeral articulation of words gave Joyce an occasion for foregrounding, in Aeolus, both the ancient art of rhetoric and the modern craft of newspaper reporting. Throughout the chapter, blaring all-caps section headings that resemble headlines make the prose itself echo the newspaper business. At the same time, arrangements of words throughout the chapter demonstrate the precepts of ancient rhetoricians. Hundreds of phrases exemplify the rhetorical \"Tropes\" (one of the \"Tecnica\" or techniques listed in the Linati schema) that were catalogued by writers like Quintilian: metonymy, ecphonesis, prosopopoeia, and so forth. Three quoted speeches exemplify Aristotle's principal types of oratory, also listed in that section of the schema: \"Symbouleutike\" (deliberative), \"Dikanike\" (forensic), and \"Epideictic\" (praising and blaming). Still other details exemplify the ancient orators' reliance on gestures, and their goal of emotionally moving listeners. Both of Joyce's schemas identify the Organ of the chapter as \"Lungs,\" and its Art as \"Rhetoric.\"\n As assiduously as he studded the chapter with rhetorical figures, Joyce also filled it with images of wind. Actual gusts find their way into the newspaper offices: \"The door of Ruttledge's office whispered: ee: cree. They always build one door opposite another for the wind to. Way in. Way out.\" A \"mouthorgan\" sounds at one point, and a mocking headline turns the bingbang twanging of some dental floss into a \"HARP EOLIAN.\" O'Molloy takes some racing tissues from Lenehan, \"blowing them apart gently\" as he reads. Newsboys follow Bloom out of the office, \"the last zigzagging white on the breeze a mocking kite, a tail of white bowknots.\" When Bloom returns they appear again, \"their white papers fluttering,\" and then Bloom is seen \"breathless, caught in a whirl of wild newsboys.\" A moment later he is \"puffing\" from his exertions, a word that is also used when cigarette smoke is expelled: \"Myles Crawford blew his first puff violently toward the ceiling.\" Offstage, other winds blow. O'Molloy remembers \"all those trees that were blown down by that cyclone last year,\" the professor recalls \"The sack of windy Troy,\" and all the trolley cars sit \"becalmed.\" Bloom thinks of inquiries mailed to the paper: \"Dear Mr Editor, what is a good cure for flatulence?\"\n Amid these many physical movements, a still greater number of metaphorical expressions agitate the literary atmosphere: \"Windfall when he kicks out,\" \"What's in the wind,\" \"raise the wind,\" \"get some wind off my chest,\" \"Reaping the whirlwind,\" \"Weathercocks,\" \"Wetherup,\" \"all blows over,\" \"Big blowout,\" \"the breath of fresh life,\" \"take my breath away,\" \"the wheeze.\" Collectively, these figures underline the impression of hot air created by the men's breezy talk. But through its protagonists the chapter also suggests that intelligently deployed language can move the world forward. The \"little puff\" that Bloom wants for Keyes' business has proved to be sound marketing strategy in the 20th century, and Stephen's little story, although breezy and insubstantial, shows him preparing for a career in prose fiction. The \"divine afflatus\" that Mr. O'Madden Burke hears in one of the recited speeches becomes something more than a dead cliché when one considers that the word comes from a Latin root meaning \"to blow.\" It evokes the idea of inspiration from ancient times, when gods \"breathed\" truth into human vessels. Channeling Genesis, Stephen resolves to become such a vessel: \"On now. Dare it. Let there be life.\""

  "010094agenbite": {
    "note": " As Haines tries to ingratiate himself with Stephen, Stephen thinks sullenly that the friendly overtures are motivated by guilt: \"Speaking to me. They wash and tub and scrub. Agenbite of inwit. Conscience. Yet here's a spot.\" He reads into Haines’ solicitude about all things Irish a conscience desperate to atone for all the blood on English hands. Two different literary evocations of the gnawing action of conscience, one medieval and one early modern, inform his thoughts.",
    "expandedNote": " Thornton traces the first allusion to a moral treatise compiled by a Dominican friar named Lorens under the title Somme des Vices et Vertus (1279) and translated into Kentish Middle English by Dan Michel of Northgate as Ayenbite of Inwyt (1340). The English title means \"again-biting of in-wit,\" powerfully suggesting a mind (“wyt”) turned in upon itself, biting the offender with bad conscience again and again (“ayen”). \n Shakespeare’s Macbeth dramatically represents the same thing, showing how the murderers’ minds torture them with guilty hallucinations about the acts they have committed. Macbeth is visited at a dinner party by Banquo's ghost. Lady Macbeth scrubs her hands as she walks in her sleep, trying to erase the “spots” of Duncan’s blood: \"Yet here's a spot. . . . Out, damn'd spot\" (5.1.31, 35). Both comment poignantly on what their thoughts are doing to them: “Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him?” (5.1.39-40); “O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!” (3.2.36).\n In Scylla and Charybdis, a chapter filled to bursting with Shakespearean allusions, Stephen applies the phrase to a widowed Anne Hathaway: \"Venus has twisted her lips in prayer.Agenbite of inwit: remorse of conscience.\" He applies it also to himself, thinking of the pound that George Russell lent him when he was hungry: \"Go to! You spent most of it in Georgina Johnson’s bed, clergyman’s daughter. Agenbite of inwit.\" His remorse here seems mild, but at the end of Wandering Rocks, the self-punishment implied by the phrase becomes overwhelming as he thinks of his sister: \"She is drowning. Agenbite. Save her. Agenbite. All against us. She will drown me with her, eyes and hair. Lank coils of seaweed hair around me, my heart, my soul. Salt green death. / We. / Agenbite of inwit. Inwit’s agenbite. / Misery! Misery!\""

  "040061agendath": {
    "note": " The \"pile of cut sheets\" on the butcher's counter in Calypso, used for wrapping meat, evidently consists of pieces of newspaper containing various advertisements. When Bloom takes up a page while waiting in line, he reads about a \"model farm at Kinnereth.\" Later, as he walks back along Dorset Street, he reads about \"Agendath Netaim: planters' company.\" These are two different ads, but both promote settlements in Palestine, suggesting that the butcher reads papers with strong Zionist leanings. The apparent mention of \"Moses Montefiore\" somewhere on the page of ads confirms for Bloom that Dlugacz is Jewish: \"I thought he was.\"",
    "expandedNote": " When Bloom takes up a page while waiting in line, he reads about \"the model farm at Kinnereth on the lakeshore of Tiberias. Can become ideal winter sanatorium.\" Tiberias is a small city on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee, in the northeast corner of what is now Israel. Part of the Turkish empire in 1904, it was one of the centers of Jewish life in Ottoman Palestine. Modern Jews have long regarded it as one of four Holy Cities, along with Jerusalem and Hebron (both holy in biblical times), and Safed (a site of kabbalistic scholarship after the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in the 15th century). Many rabbis moved to Tiberias in the 18th and 19th centuries, making it a vital spot for Jewish learning and earning it the reputation for holiness. Kinnereth is another name for Galilee (it means \"harp\" in Hebrew, referring to the shape of the lake), as well as a hill on the western shore of the lake that was the site of an ancient fortified city.\n The ad that Bloom reads describes a farm intended as a \"model\" for future settlement of the region, though it would also make an \"ideal winter sanatorium\" for infirm Europeans seeking the benefits of a warm dry climate. It is accompanied by a photograph very likely identical to the one reproduced here from the letterhead of the Palestine Land Development Company, showing a \"Farmhouse, wall round it, blurred cattle cropping. He held the page from him: interesting: read it nearer, the title, the blurred cropping cattle, the page rustling. A young white heifer.\" The same photograph was displayed on stock certificates of the PLDC, as shown in the second image here. Joyce's paragraph does not make clear whether the ad is soliciting investments in the corporation or in the Palestinian properties that it manages.\n The ad evidently concerns a business proposition, but it is also part of a Zionist program to promote more Jewish settlement of the holy land. The PLDC, founded in 1908-9 (if Joyce was relying on their photo he was guilty of some anachronism), was an organization devoted to purchasing Palestinian land and training Jewish settlers to become successful farmers. Before the outbreak of war in 1914 it had purchased about 50,000 dunams and had plans to acquire far more. (The dunam is a Turkish measure of land equal to approximately one fourth of an acre.)\n Some paragraphs later, as Bloom walks home \"reading gravely\" (probably from another spot on the same sheet), the subject is \"Agendath Netaim: planters' company. To purchase waste sandy tracts from Turkish government and plant with eucalyptus trees.\" The announcement concerns some land \"north of Jaffa\" on the Mediterranean coast, west of Tiberias and considerably farther south. (The ancient port of Jaffa is now part of Tel Aviv.) This ad from a German company (it mentions payment in marks, and the address is in Berlin) proposes a more complicated economic transaction. A \"planters' company\" proposes to purchase undeveloped land from the Turkish government and plant it with your choice of agricultural crops: eucalyptus trees, melon fields, orchards producing oranges, almonds, olives, or citrons. \"You pay eighty marks and they plant a dunam of land for you . . . Every year you get a sending of the crop. Your name entered for life as owner in the book of the union. Can pay ten down and the balance in yearly instalments.\" \n This fictional solicitation to invest in a collectively owned agricultural project was inspired by actual initiatives. In The Jews of Ireland, Louis Hyman quotes details from Marcia Gitlin's The Vision Amazing: The Story of South African Zionism (Johannesburg, 1950) of a \"contract signed in 1913 between 'Agudath Netayim' (a variant transliteration) of Palestine, represented by Arnold Kretchmar-Israeli, and the South African Zionist Federation for the establishment of a farm on about 600 dunams near Hadera, which would be planted with almonds and olives.\" Investors could pay in installments for their portion (one of 150, four dunams of land each), and in six years the crops would generate revenue for them (Hyman 188n, citing Gitlin 158-59). Bloom is not about to risk his hard-earned capital in such speculative (and, perhaps, fraudulent or overpriced?) ventures, but he is intrigued: \"Nothing doing. Still an idea behind it.\" The larger idea, behind the idea for making money, is Zionism.\n The mention of \"Montefiore\" in one of the ads lends credence to the promoters' claims. Sir Moses Haim Montefiore (1784-1885) was a wealthy London financier who retired from business in 1820 and turned his attention to philanthrophic causes. Using his money and influence to liberate Jews from political oppression in various parts of Europe, the Near East, and north Africa, he became an international hero. Starting in the 1850s he promoted Jewish settlement in the Holy Land, buying an orchard outside Jaffa where Jews could learn farming skills, building a settlement near Jerusalem, and contributing in various ways to the economic development and wellbeing of existing Jewish communities in the area. As one of the earliest advocates for what would become known as Zionism, and a revered model of sanctity (he became strictly observant after the first of his many trips to Palestine in 1827), his presence on an ad would have imparted an air of high moral purpose to the proposed economic transactions."

  "010079akasicrecords": {
    "note": " When, in the first chapter of the novel, Stephen thinks of his mother being “Folded away in the memory of nature with her toys,” he may be suspected of indulging an idiosyncratic fancy. But later chapters make clear Joyce's interest in the theosophical notion of a cosmic memory encompassing the memories compiled by all sentient beings in a kind of universal library of the soul's experiences. Stephen ponders these \"akasic records\" in Aeolus, and in Oxen of the Sun the narrative glances at the similar idea of a \"plasmic memory.\"",
    "expandedNote": " Theosophy, or “god-wisdom,” is a mystical philosophy that seeks to bring different religious traditions together in pursuit of one universal truth. Although most of its practitioners have been European, their doctrines draw heavily on Hindu religious traditions, and a branch located in India remains active today. The Theosophical Society was founded in New York City in 1875 by Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, a Russian student of the occult whose Secret Doctrine (1888) argued that everything in the universe is engaged in a process of intelligent cosmic evolution that will end with attainment of perfect spiritual awareness. The wholly independent Irish branch of the Society, still active in Dublin, was founded byGeorge Russell (\"A.E.\") and others in the 1880s under a direct charter from Madame Blavatsky.\n Some late 19th century theosophists wrote about universal memories called akashic or akasic records. Akasha is a Sanskrit word referring to the first material element created from the astral world, before air, fire, water, and earth. It means something like space or sky, and is regarded as the basis or substratum of physical existence. Theosophists combined this term with the Hindu idea that one could perfectly recall the events of past lives. The Akashic records were thus conceived as a kind of mystical encyclopedia or library, containing everything ever experienced in the history of the cosmos. They were stored on the non-physical, astral plane of existence that one entered after death, and could also be accessed in certain states (deep meditation, astral projection, hypnosis) while alive. In Aeolus, Stephen thinks of \"Akasic records of all that ever anywhere wherever was.\" \n The phrase he uses in Telemachus, \"the memory of nature,\" appears to come from The Growth of the Soul (1896), a work written by the prominent English theosophist Alfred Percy Sinnett. Stuart Gilbert's James Joyce's Ulysses (1930), cited in Thornton, quotes from a passage of Sinnett's work (216) which uses the same word: \"consciousness is in indirect relations with the all but infinite memory of Nature, which is preserved with imperishable perfection in the all-embracing medium known to occult science as the Akasa\" (189). \n Still other Theosophical texts spoke of these records as \"plasmic.\" In Oxen of the Sun, we hear of a “plasmic memory” inhering in a “plasmic substance” that alone “can be said to be immortal.” Gifford glosses it thus: “In Theosophy, the total memory of the soul’s metempsychosis, its journey through successive incarnations from lower forms through a succession of human forms toward the superhuman.” Philip P. Herring's Joyce's Ulysses Notebooks in the British Museum (University of Virginia Press, 1972) records the fact that Joyce mentioned the phrase \"plasmic memory\" in the notes on embryological development that he compiled while planning Oxen and listening to Lucia inside Nora's womb (171). \n In King Vidor, American (University of California Press, 1988), Raymond Durgnat and Scott Simmon describe a lost silent film in which the director cast his wife Florence in \"a dual role as an American and an Indian who, somehow, share the same soul. When the American sleeps, her soul shuttles off to India, but she experiences her other life in the forms of dreams, or through some sort of 'plasmic memory,' to use the term of the Theosophists, who had done much to popularize Eastern notions of metempsychosis in America\" (38).\n Joyce frequently alludes to Theosophical beliefs in Ulysses, usually to ridicule them. In Cyclops, a Sanskrit-inflected Paddy Dignam reports back to the living on the things he has discovered on the spiritual plane beyond death. Instead of universal knowledge, he is pleased to have discovered all the amenities of modern urban life, among them “tālāfānā, ālāvātār, hātākāldā, wātāklāsāt.” But although Stephen participates in that mockery, he seems willing to entertain Theosophical ideas in passages like the one in which he imagines his mother folded away in the memory of nature. Her life has become \"Phantasmal mirth, folded away: muskperfumed\" not only in the sense that its artifacts remain \"powdered with musk\" in a drawer, but also because her memories have been folded away in the vast library of human experience. Somewhere beyond, she is still playing with her featherfans and tasseled dancecards.\n Theosophy was not the first movement in Western religion and philosophy to imagine a universal mind that human beings could access in extraordinary states. When Dante begins to enter the mind of God, for instance, he describes the vision as similar to seeing the opened pages of a book in which are recorded all the “substances and accidents” that have ever been “scattered through the universe.” In Nestor, Stephen thinks of the Muslim Averroes and the Jewish Moses Maimonides, \"dark men in mien and movement, flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the world, a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not comprehend.\" In that episode, he also thinks of Averroes' inspiration, the Greek philosopher Aristotle, as having theorized something like a universal soul: \"Tranquil brightness. The soul is in a manner all that is: the soul is the form of forms. Tranquility sudden, vast, candescent: form of forms.\" Still another western philosopher who theorized a kind of world soul, Giordano Bruno, was important to Joyce. His influence on the organization of Ulysses (as well as those of Aristotle and Dante) is discussed by Theoharis Constantine Theoharis in Joyce's Ulysses: An Anatomy of the Soul (University of North Carolina Press, 1988)."

    "note": " Stephen grants little respect to the most widely admired poet of Victorian England, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, mocking his decorous gentility with the name \"Lawn Tennyson\" and the title \"gentleman poet.\" A current of hostility to English mores, English social hierarchy, and English imperialism runs through the novel's responses to this major writer. But Joyce may have derived serious inspiration from at least one of Tennyson's poems—the one that shares a title with his novel.",
    "expandedNote": " Gifford notes that \"Lawn tennis was a genteel version of the modern game—in contrast to court tennis, which was then regarded as a rigorous, demanding, and masculine game. Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809-92), the official 'great poet' of the Victorian age, succeeded Wordsworth as Poet Laureate. Critical reaction to the disproportion of elaborate prosody to often rather flimsy subject matter caused his reputation to rapidly decline in his last years, and his stature as an important poet has only been reestablished in recent times.\" On James Joyce Online Notes, Harald Beck notes that Joyce did not invent the lawn tennis witticism. It had been circulating since the late 1870s, started by satirical caricatures in the London humor magazines Judy and Punch. \n In Proteus Stephen recalls some of Tennyson's early verse: \"Of all the glad new year, mother.\" The phrase comes from the first stanza of an early, longish (39 quatrains), and very unremarkable poem called The May Queen (1833), in which a young woman tells her mother to wake her up early on the morrow, because she is going to be crowned Queen of the May. The poem was set to music, and it seems to be the song that Stephen knows, judging by the \"rum tum tiddledy tum\" with which he follows his quotation. In Scylla and Charybdis Stephen offers up another passing tidbit of Tennyson, when he refers to \"lady friends from neighbour seats,\" a quotation from the Prologue to The Princess; A Medley (1847).\n Circe contains a meatier, frankly sarcastic reference to Tennyson's The Charge of the Light Brigade (1854), the anti-imperialistic tenor of the allusion suggesting that Joyce faulted Tennyson not just for triviality but also for jingoism. When two thuggish British soldiers assault Stephen in the street, the peer appears as a \"Gentleman poet in Union Jack blazer and cricket flannels, bareheaded, flowingbearded,\" proclaiming \"Theirs not to reason why,\" a line from the second stanza of the poem:\n \"Forward, the Light Brigade!\"\n Was there a man dismay'd?\n Not tho' the soldier knew\n Someone had blunder'd.\n Theirs not to make reply,\n Theirs not to reason why,\n Theirs but to do and die.\n Into the valley of Death\n Rode the six hundred. \n Unreasoning patriotic aggression appears to rather better effect when deployed against overwhelming military forces than when used as a goad to beat up unarmed, and pacifist, civilians. \n These several dismissive allusions notwithstanding, Joyce appears to have found some grounds for engaging more appreciatively with Tennyson's verse. Aeolus and Lestrygonians refer to the celebrated dramatic monologue Ulysses in ways that prompt reflection on the life-paths of Telemachus/Stephen and Odysseus/Bloom."

    "expandedNote": " St. Andrew's is a lovely church, and its founding in 1832, shortly after Catholic Emancipation in 1828-29, was a matter of considerable civic pride. The website of the Irish Catholic Bishops Conference, www.catholicbishops.ie, notes that \"The church cost £20,000 to build, a large sum reflecting the new-found confidence of Irish Catholics in the period after Emancipation. The decision to build St Andrew's was also strongly supported by one of its most eminent parishioners, Daniel O’Connell.\" O'Connell, of course, had played a crucial role in passing the laws that legitimized Catholic worship.\n As happens again with the mortuary chapel in the next chapter, Bloom takes no architectural or historical interest in the church. For him it is a place where an alien species performs strange rites. He is, however, \"called\" in by \"The cold smell of sacred stone\"—an extraordinarily apt and beautiful evocation of the experience of leaving city streets for the quiet of an old stone church."

    "expandedNote": " Deasy interprets the saying in an all-inclusive, self-congratulatory way consistent with his effort to convince Stephen that the present order is not only inevitable but ideal. In Proteus Stephen recalls the proverb sardonically, thinking about the many \"pretenders\" who aspired to control all of Ireland as High King, or to establish Ireland's independence from English overlords, or to establish a claim to the throne of England itself through some fabricated genealogy.

    "note": " Martin Cunningham's first words in Hades, \"Are we all here now?,\" would be utterly unremarkable were it not for what follows: \"Come along, Bloom.\" The impression that Bloom is somehow superfluous—not really part of the \"we\"—will be amply confirmed by other conversations that take place in this chapter, including one in which Cunningham says, about owing money to Jews, \"We have all been there,\" and then, looking at Bloom, corrects himself: \"Well, nearly all of us.\"",
    "expandedNote": " Perhaps when Cunningham asks whether everyone is in the carriage he does not know, or has momentarily forgetten, that Bloom will be making up the fourth. Perhaps he knows it and his question is a rhetorical one designed to hurry Bloom along. Perhaps he is simply slighting him by addressing him in the way one would address a pet dog. Whatever the explanation, his verbal delivery leaves a distinct and disquieting impression that Bloom is an afterthought in his mental tally. For probably the first time, readers of the novel realize that Bloom is tolerated but not fully accepted by many of his fellow Dubliners.\n As the cramped carriage begins rolling along, the other three men call each other \"Martin,\" \"Simon,\" and, much later in the chapter, \"Jack.\" It turns out that such informality pervades the chapter: it has its John and John Henry, its Ned and Corny, Tom and Paddy, Ben and Blazes. Bloom remains Bloom throughout, in a clear act of linguistic distancing that he evidently deals with every day. Near the end of the chapter Joe Hynes, who is taking down names for mention in the newspaper—he works for the same newspaper as Bloom, and owes him money—has to ask, \"What is your christian name? I'm not sure.\" Bloom answers \"Leopold.\" (Eumaeus will reveal that Hynes nonetheless manages to misspell the surname.) Bloom then fulfills the promise that he made in Lotus Eaters to have M'Coy's name fraudulently inserted into the article (\"Thanks, old man. I’d go if I possibly could. Well, tolloll. Just C. P. M’Coy will do\"). Although M'Coy is always referred to in the novel by his last name, Hynes nods in response, \"Charley.\" \n The reference to Bloom's \"christian name\" is particularly telling. In one way it is insensitive, since Bloom is Jewish, or at least commonly assumed to be so. In another way it is appropriate, since Bloom's Hungarian Jewish father changed his family name along with his religion in order to assimilate into Irish society. That ambiguity—is Bloom one of us, or one of them?—pervades the scene in which Martin, Jack, and Simon feel free to sneer at the purportedly Jewish Dodd in the company of the supposedly Jewish Bloom. Cunningham's \"We have all been there\" implies that it is wrong for Jews to have more money than Christians and for Christians to have to pay back what they have borrowed from them. His \"Well, nearly all of us\" implies that Bloom, who has been made an honorary Christian by being included in the conversation, still is tainted by his kinship with a despicable moneylender. \n Bloom pathetically attempts to ingratiate himself with this obviously prejudiced company by telling them a humiliating story about Dodd's son being fished out of the Liffey. His narration is disrespectfully hijacked by Cunningham, who finishes telling the story himself, at one point brushing off Bloom's effort to regain the floor. Instead of sulking, Bloom encourages applause for the story that has been stolen from him: \"Isn't it awfully good? Mr Bloom said eagerly.\" This poignant episode in the carriage suggests that even when Jews attempt to play the game they still cannot lead. \n In Further Recollections of James Joyce (1955), Frank Budgen recalls being struck by, and hearing Joyce confirm, Bloom's \"loneliness as a Jew who finds no warmth of fellowship either among Jews or Gentiles.\" Bloom has left the one community for the other, only to find no real community there. In his introduction to Hades written for James Joyce's Ulysses: Critical Essays, Robert Martin Adams observes that during the funeral cortège Bloom \"acts the part of an outsider, a latecomer, a half-rejected and scarcely tolerated hanger-on\" (97). At the heart of this episode, he says, \"there is a great hollow resonance. And that is the real development of this chapter, the sounding of that resonance, the deepening and darkening in Bloom's mind of an immense emptiness\" (96-97). \n Details in many other chapters make clear that the experience of being slighted by Irish Catholics is a common one for Bloom. On his first trip into the outside world, in Calypso, he spots some unnamed man who does not respond to his salutation: \"There's whatdoyoucallhim out of. How do you? Doesn't see. Chap you know just to salute bit of a bore.\" Bloom has no particular interest in the man, he compensates for the snub by dismissing his importance, and it is possible that the man truly hasn't noticed him, but this brief encounter creates the impression of an outsider who barely registers on others' radar screens. Hades highlights the sense of cultural difference that underlies this neglect, and subsequent chapters demonstrate it again and again: the rude exclusion from male professional community in Aeolus, the behind-the-back gossiping in Lestrygonians and Scylla and Charybdis, and so on. Circe shows that these unending exclusions exact a heavy psychological toll—but malign neglect is better than outright anti-Semitic violence, as Cyclops demonstrates.\n Despite the pain of his exclusion, Bloom does find a freedom in not being bound by the mental chains of a tight social group. In Hades he advances practical suggestions for funeral trams that offend others' sense of decorum, appreciates easy deaths that violate their religious beliefs, finds human sympathy for suicides that they would exclude from the spiritual community, inwardly laughs when they are twisting their faces into somberness, faces the meaninglessness of extinction without having to ingest soteriological pablum. James Joyce found his calling by embracing an ethos of \"silence, exile, and cunning.\" Bloom appears to be traveling a similar path."

    "note": " As Stephen thinks back, in Proteus, on his insistence that Buck not demean him, he affirms his need to be wholly accepted: \"As I am. As I am. All or not at all.\" The second declaration returns in Circe. Stephen's romantic self-affirmation probably owes its inspiration to Henrik Ibsen, the truth-telling Norwegian playwright whom the young Joyce admired extravagantly. It may also owe something to Oscar Wilde.",
    "expandedNote": " Gifford hears \"All or not at all\" as a reference to Ibsen's first great play, Brand (1866). The eponymous protagonist, whose name means \"fire,\" is a messianic Lutheran priest who believes that God requires a total commitment of the human will. His motto is \"Give nothing or give all,\" or \"Be what you are with all your heart, / And not by pieces and in part\" (trans. C. H. Herford). \n As Gifford notes, this uncompromising message proves difficult not only for Brand but for everyone around him. He leaves his mother alone while she is dying, because she will not give away the money that she wrongly took from her husband. He decides not to move from the unhealthy climate that is killing his young son, because the surrounding farmers need him (he points out that God did not make compromises to save his son). He urges his wife to give away their son's clothes to another woman whose child is freezing, and in doing so, she gives up her hold on life. Brand's relationship with his mother might be supposed to hold particular resonance for Stephen, and to have been suggested to his mind by the conflict with Mulligan, who has accused Stephen of killing his mother.\n Thornton hears in \"As I am\" an echo of Oscar Wilde, of whom Stephen has just been thinking in connection with his emotional involvement with Mulligan. Thornton cites John Z. Bennett's observation that, in chapter 9 of The Picture of Dorian Gray, Dorian says to Basil Hallward, \"Don't leave me, Basil, and don't quarrel with me. I am what I am. There is nothing more to be said.\""

    "note": " Bloom likes to write love letters with dirty words in them—as did his creator (though in later life Joyce was notably prudish in society, refusing to countenance conversational obscenities). Ulysses is sparing in its use of dirty words, but even when they are tactfully omitted, their absent presence opens windows onto unseen worlds.",
    "expandedNote": " In Penelope Molly thinks of a letter that Bloom wrote when he was courting her, and how troublesomely it mixed sex up with social niceties: \"then he wrote me that letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to any woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we met asking me have I offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw I wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool Henny Doyle he was always breaking or tearing something in the charades I hate an unlucky man and if I knew what it meant of course I had to say no for form sake dont understand you I said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it used to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in Gibraltar with that word I couldnt find anywhere only for children seeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice a day I liked the way he made love then.\" One of the words next to the obscene drawing in Gibraltar seems to have sent her in search of its meaning, and by the time she met Bloom she was neither ignorant of nor offended by such words. But even now she prefers not to use them: \"the picture of a womans on that wall.\" \n In Lotus Eaters Bloom has started a correspondence with a woman who calls herself Martha Clifford, and he fears that she will probably not have written him back because he \"Went too far last time.\" But she has written back: \"I am awfully angry with you. I do wish I could punish you for that. I called you naughty boy because I do not like that other world. Please tell me what is the real meaning of that word? Are you not happy in your home you poor little naughty boy?\" Martha's \"other world\" is clearly a slip for \"other word,\" probably the word whose meaning she asks in the next sentence of her letter. But the slip suggests that she may not like to think about that other world of carnal desire that the world of polite society manages to repress.\n But letters like this can also open up worlds of romantic feeling. Molly wishes that Boylan had the capacity to write such letters: \"I wish somebody would write me a loveletter his wasnt much and I told him he could write what he liked yours ever Hugh Boylan in old Madrid silly women believe love is sighing I am dying still if he wrote it I suppose thered be some truth in it true or no it fills up your whole day and life always something to think about every moment and see it all round you like a new world.\"\n In Bloom's mind the phrase \"other world\" acquires still another meaning. At the end of Hades, having brooded at length on death and religious consolations, he thinks, \"There is another world after death named hell. I do not like that other world she wrote. No more do I. Plenty to see and hear and feel yet. Feel live warm beings near you. Let them sleep in their maggoty beds. They are not going to get me this innings. Warm beds: warm fullblooded life.\" Martha's phrase calls up all the claims of philosophers and theologians that a truer world lies somewhere beyond this one. Molly, who is religious, may dream of a life free of such burdens as menstruation: \"O this nuisance of a thing I hope theyll have something better for us in the other world.\" But Bloom is content to take life in the body for truth."

To wake up, they ask him to narrate the dreadful tale of their former ruler, the old Count di Luna. Ferrando obliges them, saying that they must know the former Count was blessed with two sons: the present Count di Luna and his younger brother Garzia. The latter was only a baby when his nurse awoke to find an old gypsy witch standing next to his cradle and apparently casting spells on him. Servants rushed in and seized the sorceress. She protested her innocence, saying that she was only telling the baby's horoscope. But the child sickened, and she was burned at the stake. From the pyre she demanded that her daughter Azucena avenge her death, and Azucena complied by stealing the child. Pursuing her, Ferrando and other soldiers found a fire with embers still smoking and the half-burned bones of a child: \"d'un bambino—ohimè—l'ossame / Bruciato a mezzo, fumante ancor!\"\n This bloodcurdling story sets the soldiers on edge, and Ferrando completes the job by telling them that the old witch still haunts the area as a spirit, creeping about the roof at night and flying through the air. An old man died when she appeared before him, in the form of an owl, at the hour of midnight . . . At that moment a clock strikes twelve, and all the soldiers rush to their posts, uttering maledictions."

  "030110altarshorns": {
    "note": " Stephen's somber fantasy, in Proteus, of priests celebrating the Mass includes many odd details: Joachim as a celebrant, a choir answering his \"basiliskeyed\" stare with \"menace and echo,\" and \"jackpriests\" (suggesting, Gifford notes, \"priests in name only\") who are \"oiled and gelded.\" Perhaps the strangest is the image of servers \"assisting about the altar's horns.\" Catholic altars do not have horns, but ancient Hebrew altars did. They seem to have been associated with the sacrifice of bulls and other animals, and Stephen seems to associate them with \"the snorted Latin\" of the priests. Later in the novel, Bloom thinks of the offerings burned on such altars.",
    "expandedNote": " Altars are mentioned throughout the Old Testament. The Hebrew word, mizbe'ah or mizbach, means a place of slaughter or sacrifice. Exodus describes altars of burnt offerings, specifying that \"thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock, and put it upon the horns of the altar with thy finger, and pour all the blood beside the bottom of the altar. And thou shalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul that is above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and burn them upon the altar\" (29:12-13). Bloom's phrase in Lestrygonians, \"kidney burntoffering,\" indicates his awareness of this tradition. In Calypso he has cut away some burned flesh from his fried kidney and flung it as an offering to his cat. \n The horns, by all accounts, were on the four corners of the altar. Exodus 27:2 says that they \"shall be of the same\" shittim wood as the altar itself, and everything covered with brass—suggesting that rather than attaching actual animal horns to the altar, workmen carved wood in that shape. Some passages (e.g., 1 Kings 1:50-53) indicate that fugitives could seek asylum by clinging to these projections.\n Stephen's meditations on the sacrifice of bulls, and on priests snorting out the Latin of their rite, may bear some connection to his own self-identification with oxen as \"Bous Stephanoumenos,\" a wreathed sacrificial victim, and thus his status as the \"bullockbefriending bard.\" At the end of Scylla and Charybdis, he thinks again of altars with burnt offerings: \"Laud we the gods / And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils / From our bless'd altars.\""

  "020024amormatris": {
    "note": " Watching the pitiful Sargent copy his sums in Nestor, Stephen thinks, \"Yet someone had loved him, borne him in her arms and in her heart. But for her the race of the world would have trampled him underfoot, a squashed boneless snail. She had loved his weak watery blood drained from her own. Was that then real? The only true thing in life?\" A little later, he calls this true thing \"Amor matris:subjective and objective genitive.\" The Latin phrase means \"love of mother,\" but matris could be \"subjective\" genitive, meaning that the mother is the subject feeling the love, or \"objective\" in the sense that she is the object for whom the child feels love. Both kinds of love are crucially important to Stephen, judging by details in his fictional history and in Joyce's own life.",
    "expandedNote": " Mother love preoccupies Stephen because he feels he poorly repaid his own mother's protective care. Like Sargent's, his mother saved him from the world's indifference: \"She was no more: the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the fire, an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes. She had saved him from being trampled underfoot and had gone, scarcely having been.\" But, having counted on this protection thoughout his childhood and adolescence, he subordinated his mother's spiritual needs to his own (as any healthy child must) when it came time to define himself as an adult. As an apostate, he refused to pray at her bedside, and he deflects his terrible Catholic guilt over that action by identifying with an early saint who chose religious faith over attachment to his mother: \"His mother's prostrate body the fiery Columbanus in holy zeal bestrode.\" \n This decisive development has taken place in the unnarrated space between the end of A Portrait of the Artist and the beginning of Ulysses, but Joyce has prepared his readers for it in the final section of A Portrait. There, Stephen's friend Cranly has said, \"Whatever else is unsure in this stinking dunghill of a world a mother's love is not. Your mother brings you into the world, carries you first in her body. What do we know about how she feels? But whatever she feels, it, at least, must be real.\" Stephen has resisted Cranly's call to honor the supreme reality of \"a mother's love,\" asking him what he thinks of Pascal, who \"would not suffer his mother to kiss him as he feared the contact of her sex,\" or Aloysius Gonzaga who \"was of the same mind,\" or Jesus who \"seems to have treated his mother with scant courtesy in public.\" \n After some further conversation, he decides that Cranly's devotion to women disqualifies him for Stephen's friendship: \"He had spoken of a mother's love. He felt then the sufferings of women, the weaknesses of their bodies and souls: and would shield them with a strong and resolute arm and bow his mind to them...Away then: it is time to go. A voice spoke softly to Stephen's lonely heart, bidding him go and telling him that his friendship was coming to an end. Yes; he would go. He could not strive against another.\" Attachment to one's mother becomes associated in his thinking, then, with heterosexual desire, and both of them feel like hindrances on his path to spiritual independence. But things have changed by the time represented in Ulysses. Heterosexual love now appears to be not a stumbling block on Stephen's path to adulthood, but its necessary first step. As Stephen thinks in Scylla and Charybdis, \"And my turn? When? / Come!\" \n Furthermore, the link between heterosexual love and amor matris seems to have persisted in Joyce's adult life, making his love for Nora in some ways an attempt to recapture the lost bond with his mother. Ellmann observes that on Sept. 2, 1909 he wrote to Nora, in language strongly reminiscent of Cranly's words in A Portrait and Stephen's in Nestor, \"O that I could nestle in your womb like a child born of your flesh and blood, be fed by your blood, sleep in the warm secret gloom of your body\" (293). Later in life, Ellmann notes, Maria Jolas remarked, that \"'Joyce talked of fatherhood as if it were motherhood.' He seems to have longed to establish in himself all aspects of the bond of mother and child. He was attracted, particularly, by the image of himself as a weak child cherished by a strong woman, which seems closely connected with the images of himself as a victim, whether as a deer pursued by hunters, as a passive man surrounded by burly extroverts, as a Jesus or Parnell among traitors. His favorite characters are those who in one way or another retreat before masculinity, yet are loved regardless by motherly women\" (293).\n As for Cranly's notion that a mother's love is more real than anything else in one's life—\"The only true thing in life,\" as Stephen says in Nestor—Joyce once remarked to Stanislaus that \"There are only two forms of love in the world, the love of a mother for her child and the love of a man for lies\" (293)."

  "140004anastomosis": {
    "note": " In Oxen of the Sun Stephen imagines all of humankind \"linked up\" with its first mother, Eve, \"by successive anastomosis of navelcords.\" An anastomosis, in medicine, is a connection between adjacent tubular structures, whether natural (e.g., capillaries), accidental (e.g., fistulas), or surgical (e.g., gastric bypass). In Stephen's imagination such connections can be both interpersonal and infinite. The umbilicus connects the vascular network of the child to the vascular network of its mother, another umbilicus connected that mother to her mother, and so on, with the logical result that all of us are still bathed in the first woman's blood.",
    "expandedNote": " The language suits the context of Oxen: Stephen briefly considered pursuing a career in medicine, and now he apes the talk of Mulligan and the other young medicals, just as he appropriated Shakespeare's words in Scylla and Charybdis. But the underlying conceit is sheer fantasy. It grows out of his extravagant thoughts about omphaloskepsis and telephony in Proteus,where gaining mystical oneness with the universe means gazing into your navel, and the umbilicus becomes a phone line to Eden. Here in Oxen Stephen seems to be imagining a physiological vehicle for the Catholic doctrine of original sin: a long chain of veins and arteries explains how Eve's transgression \"sold us all, seed, breed, and generation, for a penny pippin.\" \n Tubular structures appear often in Ulysses as figures for the exchanges that occur between humanity and its physical and social environment. Molly thinks of Paul de Kock \"going about with his tube from one woman to another,\" evoking a view of sexual intercourse as a kind of anastomosis between penetrator and penetrated. The term comes from a Greek verb meaning \"to furnish with a mouth,\" and mouths too function as a kind of link to the world outside the self. They stand at one end of a tube through which, day after day, a human being takes in and casts out the other. In Lestrygonians Bloom thinks of a cycle that is as inexorable as it is endless: \"stuffing food in one hole and out behind: food, chyle, blood, dung, earth, food: have to feed it like stoking an engine.\"\n This chapter seems to recognize sympathies between the different piping systems in the human body. The line between ingestion and sexual exchange became blurry in the memorable kiss that took place between Molly and Bloom on Howth Head: \"Ravished over her I lay, full lips full open, kissed her mouth. Yum. Softly she gave me in my mouth the seedcake warm and chewed. Mawkish pulp her mouth had mumbled sweet and sour with spittle. Joy: I ate it: joy.\" After Bloom thinks about the constant need to eat and excrete, he wonders whether goddesses have anuses, and then his penis becomes simultaneously a site of urination and sexual intercourse: \"Dribbling a quiet message from his bladder came to go to do not to do there to do. A man and ready he drained his glass to the lees and walked, to men too they gave themselves, manly conscious, lay with men lovers, a youth enjoyed her, to the yard.\" \n The \"anastomosis of navelcords\" conceit takes such thoughts in a metaphysical direction, applying the principle of interpenetration to impalpable realities no less than physical ones. Several pages later in Oxen of the Sun, one of the chapter's narrators reinforces Stephen's idea. When he cowers before the thunderclap and Bloom attempts to soothe his fears, the Bunyan-like voice says: \"Heard he then in that clap the voice of the god Bringforth or, what Calmer said, a hubbub of Phenomenon? Heard? Why, he could not but hear unless he had plugged up the tube Understanding (which he had not done). For through that tube he saw that he was in the land of Phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die as he was like the rest too a passing show.\" \n As so often in Oxen, the thought underlying the baffling verbiage is relatively straightforward: Stephen takes no comfort from Bloom's observation that thunder is only a natural phenomenon, because in such a world he too is only a natural phenomenon, doomed to vanish. But to see this highly abstract way of \"Understanding\" mortality as a \"tube\" is surpassingly strange. How is cognition like circulation, ingestion, excretion, and intercourse? To what is Stephen's mind connected? Is the exchange one-way, or reciprocal?"

On the sideboard the tray of Stuart coins, base treasure of a bog: and ever shall be. And snug in their spooncase of purple plush, faded, the twelve apostles having preached to all the gentiles: world without end.\"",
    "expandedNote": " To Stephen, they are not words of comfort. Slightly later in this part of Nestor, with the same Trinitarian rhythm drumming in his head, he thinks, \"The same room and hour, the same wisdom: and I the same. Three times now. Three nooses round me here. Well? I can break them in this instant if I will.\" Rather than celebrating payday, he broods morosely on being entrapped in the same bleak reality as before. Nestor began with Blakean thoughts of smashing the order of time and space, and shattering the political order. This titanic ambition acquires more grimly personal expression as Stephen sits in his employer's office thinking of his paycheck as a noose around his neck. \n In Proteus, he quotes the Gloria Patri as coda to a more whimsical, lighthearted effort to transcend material reality. Having closed his eyes in the hope of rending the sensory veil and walking into eternity, he acknowledges the unsurprising result: \"See now. There all the time without you: and ever shall be, world without end.\""

    "expandedNote": " The anima mundi, as it came to be known, is an essentially religious conception, but Plato offers it less as a doctrinal claim than as a myth—a kind of encouragement to study the metaphysical bases of our world. Joyce may have encountered the idea in more doctrinal forms, however. Gifford suggests that he acquired it from Giordano Bruno, the Italian philosopher and cosmographer whom the Catholic Church burned to death in the Campo dei Fiori in 1600. His claim seems plausible since, as he notes, the young Joyce named him the \"father of what is called modern philosophy,\" and since Joyce later filled A Portrait of the Artist, Ulysses, and Finnegans Wake with admiring references to the Nolan. Bruno uses Aristotelian logical terminology to advance an essentially Neoplatonic metaphysics. He describes the ways in which every part of the material universe is spiritually interconnected with every other part. \n A book by Theoharis Constantine Theoharis, Joyce's Ulysses: An Anatomy of the Soul (1988), explores this very systematic Brunonian understanding of the world soul as one of the possible philosophical inspirations for the organization of Ulysses."

    "expandedNote": " Several members of Joyce's musical family sang in the Antient Concert Rooms, including his father and one of his mother's aunts. James himself sang there on 24 August 1904, and again on August 27 in the Grand Irish Concert that also featured legendary tenor John McCormack. Of the first concert, the Freeman's Journal reported on August 25 that \"Mr. J. A. Joyce’s fine tenor was heard to advantage in 'Down by the Sally Garden' and 'My Love She was born in the north Countree'. He was warmly applauded.\" Ellmann records that the paper covered the second concert as well, writing that \"James A. Joyce, the possessor of a sweet tenor voice, sang charmingly 'The Salley Gardens,' and gave a pathetic rendering of 'The Croppy Boy.'\" Of McCormack, the paper said that he \"was the hero of the evening. It was announced as his last public appearance in Ireland.\" \n About the August 27 concert, Ellmann quotes also (168) from Joseph Holloway's diary: \"The attendance was good but the management of the entertainment could not have been worse. The Irish Revivalists are sadly in need of a capable manager. At present they invariably begin considerably after the time advertised and make the audience impatient; thus they handicap the performers unwarrantably. Tonight was no exception to the rule; and after the first item, the delay was so long that the audience became quite noisy and irritable . . . The substitute appointed as accompanist in place of Miss Eileen Reidy, who left early in the evening, was so incompetent that one of the vocalists, Mr. James A. Joyce, had to sit down at the piano and accompany himself in the song 'In Her Simplicity,' after she had made several unsuccessful attempts to strum out 'The Croppy Boy,' the item programmed over the singer's name.\"\n Joyced mined these embarrassments for material that he worked into the memorable Dubliners story \"A Mother,\" which takes place in the Antient Concert Rooms."

But that has not stopped him from imagining the rapture that will greet his earthshaking mature work, and he has actually practiced bows in the mirror to acknowledge the thunderous applause. In Telemachus and again in Proteus he mocks this callow asininity of a younger self. Circe affirms that, personally and artistically, he has \"far to go.\"",

What an astonishing work of art!). In Proteus, he mocks himself with even more savage humor: “You bowed to yourself in the mirror, stepping forward to applause earnestly, striking face. Hurray for the Goddamned idiot!”\n Like so much else about Stephen's thoughts, these bitter reflections show how far he is from finding happiness and artistic success. (In Circe Stephen tells Zoe that he was born on a Thursday, and she reminds him of the nursery rhyme: \"Thursday's child has far to go.\") But by mocking himself Stephen indicates readiness to learn from his past errors, and he refines the herculean egoism that may eventually enable him to write a great work.

  "010102aquinas": {
    "note": " Forestalling any performance of Stephen's Shakespeare theory until later, Mulligan declares in Telemachus, \"I'm not equal to Thomas Aquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made to prop it up. Wait till I have a few pints in me first.\" Stephen thinks of the philosopher inProteus: \"Morose delectation Aquinas tunbelly calls this.\" When he finally expounds his theory inScylla and Charybdis, he does not use Aquinian ideas nearly as much as he did in articulating his aesthetic theorizings in A Portrait; but he does refer affectionately to Aquinas as a philosopher “whose gorbellied works I enjoy reading in the original.”",
    "expandedNote": " The “original” of the huge (\"gorbellied\") Summa Theologica and Summa contra Gentiles is Latin, the language of the medieval Catholic church. Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) was a Dominican friar and theologian; the Dominicans were as famous for intellectual rigor as the Franciscans were for emotional fervor. The intricately logical Scholastic method of Aquinas’ two big Summae sought to reconcile Aristotelian philosophy with Christian faith. Extremely controversial in his own time, largely because of this synthesis of theistic belief with pagan philosophy, by the end of the 19th century Thomas had become absolutely canonical, recognized as the greatest and most orthodox of all Catholic philosophers. Stephen’s devotion to him has survived the lapse of his faith. In Scylla and Charybdis, Buck Mulligan announces (with “malice”) that “I called upon the bard Kinch at his summer residence in upper Mecklenburgh street [a street in the red-light district] and found him deep in study of the Summa contra Gentiles in the company of two gonorrheal ladies, Fresh Nelly and Rosalie, the coalquay whore.” \n It is not only Aquinas' works that are gorbellied. According to popular tradition the philosopher himself was immensely fat, and anecdotes perpetuate the tradition: of holes cut in tables to make room for his belly, of monks unable to carry his dead body down the stairs from his sickroom, and so forth. In Proteus Stephen thinks of him as \"Aquinas tunbelly.\" \"Morose delectation\" is a translation of Delectatio morosa, which Thornton identifies as one of three internal sins, consisting (according to the Catholic Encyclopedia) of \"the pleasure taken in a sinful thought of imagination even without desiring it.\" He directs readers to three passages in the Summa Theologica. \n “Fiftyfive reasons” certainly does suggest Aquinas’ method of breaking large topics down into sub-topics, sub-sub-topics, and sub-sub-sub-topics, then (at the level of the specific question) proposing a statement of his belief, then anticipating the most powerful objection that might be advanced against that belief, then answering it with an “On the contrary,” and finally detailing numerous precise reasons for preferring his position. But it is also possible, Gifford notes, that the number 55 may have been suggested by a detail in Aristotle’s Metaphysics: the claim that beyond the mutable region of the earth and moon lie “fifty-five immutable celestial spheres,” perfectly “circular and changeless.” If so, Joyce is rather naturally associating Aquinas with the cosmological ideas of his master, Aristotle—a philosopher whom Joyce also read with great devotion, and whom Stephen invokes repeatedly in Nestor,Proteus, and Scylla and Charybdis. \n Both of these philosophers, like Joyce himself, possessed highly logical intellects and liked to categorize information. Joyce once told a friend, “I have a grocer’s assistant’s mind.” Early in the first chapter of A Portrait, he has six-year-old Stephen write inside his geography book a note that charts the categorical levels connecting him to the highest reaches of the divinely ordered universe:\n Stephen Dedalus\n Class of Elements\n Clongowes Wood College\n Sallins\n County Kildare\n Ireland\n Europe\n The World\n The Universe"

P. at the corner of Arbour hill there and . . . who should I see dodging along Stony Batter only Joe Hynes.\" Arbour Hill and Stoneybatter are two contiguous areas in northwest Dublin and also the main roads within those areas. The narrator is standing at the intersection of the two streets, having walked several blocks down from number \"29 Arbour hill,\" where he was trying to collect on a debt. That house lies very near two important spots for Irish revolutionary history.",
    "expandedNote": " Stoneybatter Road is the name, for a short while, of a thoroughfare that starts at the quayside of the Liffey as Blackhall Place, running north from the site of the new (2003) James Joyce Bridge. Turning northwest, the avenue becomes Stoneybatter for several blocks and then Manor Street. At the beginning of the Stoneybatter stretch a residential lane called Arbour Hill departs to the southwest, and it is here that \"An old plumber named Geraghty\" dwells, refusing to reimburse a moneylender named Moses Herzog. \n § This location would be unremarkable were it not for the fact that, at the time represented in the novel, two pillars of British imperial power straddled the Arbour Hill road only one block further west. Just south of the road sat the huge Royal Barracks, housing the largest assemblage of British troops in Dublin. In 1798 Wolfe Tone and two other leaders of the United Irishmen rebellion, Henry and John Sheares, were imprisoned in these barracks. Tried by court-martial and convicted of treason, Tone either committed suicide or was murdered in prison; the Sheares brothers were hanged, drawn, and quartered. Cyclops later mentions all three, inspiring the hilarious parody of an execution report: \"And the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, the brothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet and die for your country.\" The Sheares brothers' mutilated remains, and possibly those of Robert Emmet as well, were buried in the crypt of the nearby St. Michan's church, which also figures in the chapter.\n This much is part of the historical record for the people in the bar, but Joyce would have been aware of another piece of history that they could not know because it had not yet happened. Just north of the Royal Barracks, across Arbour Hill road, lies the Arbour Hill military prison. In May 1916, fourteen leaders of the Easter Rising who had been executed by firing squad in Kilmainham Gaol were taken there and buried without any ceremony—shoved in the ground and covered with quicklime. The burial site at the edge of the prison was used as an exercise yard, though it may technically have been part of the prison cemetery grounds. Bishop Thomas O'Dwyer declared that the British had denied the men a Christian burial by interring them in unconsecrated ground, and there was a public outcry that helped turn popular opinion in favor of the rebels. \n After the establishment of the Irish Free State, the government resolved to make Arbour Hill a place of heroic commemoration rather than shameful obscurity, and these efforts have continued during the era of the Republic. Today, the mass grave is backed by a wall inscribed with the names of the 14 men, and their deaths are commemorated every year in May. The wall also reproduces the text of the 1916 Proclamation in both English and Irish. \n It might be objected that Joyce, so philosophically committed to realistic depiction, would not have evoked the events of 1916 in a novel set in 1904. But the more one digs into the densely woven fabrics of Ulysses the less tenable this hypothesis becomes. Nestor evokes the carnage of the Great War (1914-18) by seeing \"slush and uproar of battles, the frozen deathspew of the slain, a shout of spearspikes baited with men's bloodied guts\" in a hockey game played by boys with names like \"Armstrong\" and \"Sargent\"—boys who, a decade later, might well have been dying in the trenches. That chapter also introduces news of a foot-and-mouth disease outbreak that would not actually come to Ireland until 1912, and the alarm over this development continues in Cyclops.Eumaeus slyly evokes the sinking of the Titanic (1912) through numerous references to lookouts, icebergs, shipwrecks, lifeboats, drowning, and individuals connected with the disaster.\n It is entirely conceivable that Joyce, as he wrote Cyclops in 1919, could have intended \"Arbour Hill\" to resonate with meanings looking both backward and forward in time from 1904. One of his literary heroes, Dante Alighieri, who held similarly grand notions of literary truth-telling, performed that trick repeatedly by exploiting a similar temporal gap between the setting of his poem (1300) and its composition (ca. 1308-20). Dead people in the Commedia refer obscurely to important future events that they can see from the perspective of eternity but that the relatively uninformed pilgrim cannot. Given the outrage that greeted the summary execution and burial of the leaders of the Easter Rising, Joyce could hardly have failed to know that Arbour Hill had gained a second grisly claim to geopolitical fame. And, given the fact that Cyclops is the chapter of Ulysses most singlemindedly devoted to the subject of violent Irish nationalism, he could hardly have failed to realize that when he chose Arbour Hill as the spot to begin the chapter he was piling one allusion on top of another. The narrator's debt-collecting visit to that spot is narratively inconsequential but intellectually supercharged."

  "010088archangelmichael": {
    "note": " In the Book of Revelation, Michael leads a victorious angelic army against the angelic forces led by Satan. The Catholic church regards Michael as an archangel. In one of two prayers read at the close of Mass in Joyce's time, it invoked him as a defense against evil.",
    "expandedNote": " Chapter 12 of Revelation describes how a \"great red dragon\" drew away \"the third part of the stars of heaven\" (3-4), i.e. one third of the angelic host. \"And there was a war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, / And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven. / And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him\" (7-9). \n In Telemachus Stephen imagines \"the vigilant angel of the church\" disarming and menacing heresiarchs. Later in the same paragraph he indicates which angel he has in mind: \"a menace, a disarming and a worsting from those embattled angels of the church, Michael's host, who defend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their shields.\" \n He is probably thinking of a prayer uttered after the Mass. Thornton observes that Pope Leo XIII directed that celebrants should conclude low mass with two prayers recited in the vernacular of each country. Leo's papal directives of 1884 and 1886, Gifford notes, were affirmed in 1903 by Pope Pius X. The first of Leo's prayers looks up to God, while the second entreats Michael to defend humanity from the evil that has been cast down to Hell.\n In Lotus Eaters Bloom listens as a priest in St. Andrew's (or \"All Hallows\") church reads \"off a card\" the words, \"O God, our refuge and our strength...\" This is the beginning of the first prayer, whose full text runs as follows: \"O God, our refuge and our strength, look down in mercy on Thy people who cry to Thee; and the intercession of the glorious and immaculate Virgin Mary, Mother of God, of Saint Joseph her spouse, of Thy blessed apostles Peter and Paul, and of all the saints, in mercy and goodness hear our prayers, and for the liberty and exaltation of our holy mother the Church: through the same Christ our Lord. Amen.\" \n Bloom leans forward \"to catch the words\" and thinks, \"I remember slightly.\" In the internal monologue that follows, he either remembers parts of the prayer, or ponders some of the words that the priest goes on to recite, or both: \"Glorious and immaculate virgin. Joseph, her spouse. Peter and Paul.\"\n His thoughts then detour into irreverent but appreciative speculations on the \"Wonderful organization\" of the Catholic mind-control enterprise, but soon the narrative once again focuses attention on his auditory experience of the service. The priest's second prayer, represented in its entirety in Lotus Eaters, entreats Michael to defend humanity from Satan: \"Blessed Michael, archangel, defend us in the hour of conflict. Be our safeguard against the wickedness and snares of the devil (may God restrain him, we humbly pray!): and do thou, O prince of the heavenly host, by the power of God thrust Satan down to hell and with him those other wicked spirits who wander through the world for the ruin of souls.\"\n The first prayer comes in for some mockery at the end of Oxen of the Sun. One of the libidinous young men who have spilled out of the maternity hospital (most likely it is Stephen, since he is contemplating a trip to the red-light district and is adept at perverting the doctrines of the church) parodies the first phrase of the prayer: \"O, lust, our refuge and our strength.\""

  "030025baldhewas": {
    "note": " Just as Nestor begins with references to an unnamed \"him\" who turns out to be the ancient Greek general Pyrrhus, the first paragraph ofProteus finds Stephen thinking of an unnamed thinker: \"Bald he was and a millionaire, maestro di color che sanno.\" The Italian phrase, which comes from Dante's Inferno, means \"the master of those who know\" and refers to Aristotle. The other details (baldness and riches) come from medieval biographical traditions about Aristotle, and the term \"diaphane\" is a transliteration of the ancient philosopher's Greek. Stephen seems to be preoccupied with Aristotle (\"he,\" \"he,\" \"his,\" \"he\") throughout this first paragraph, but Aristotle's empiricism clashes in his thoughts with a mystical search for absolute truth inspired by Jakob Boehme and George Berkeley.",
    "expandedNote": " In canto 4 of the Inferno, Dante is in Limbo, the antechamber of Hell which houses those who lived without sin but are not saved, in many cases because they lived before the coming of Christ. In a particularly \"honored\" part of Limbo, lit by bright light that seems a pagan approximation of Heaven, Dante meets the great poets of antiquity (Homer, Virgil, Horace, Ovid, Lucan) and then enters a castle where he encounters many more virtuous pagans. One figure in particular stands out: \"When I raised my eyes a little higher, / I saw the master of those who know, / sitting among his philosophic kindred. / Eyes trained on him, all show him honor. / In front of all the rest and nearest him / I saw Socrates and Plato.\" In writing of Aristotle so admiringly, Dante is following the lead of Thomas Aquinas, who referred to Aristotle simply as the Philosopher. In A Portrait of the Artist Stephen has revered Thomas Aquinas. In Ulysses he turns to Aquinas' inspiration and model, Aristotle. Nestor, Proteus, and Scylla and Charybdis all find him musing on Aristotelian ideas. \n At the beginning of Proteus the subject is vision, sight, \"thought through my eyes.\" Against the idealistic approaches of Boehme and Berkeley, who see the objects of sight as \"coloured signs\" conveying an immaterial meaning (\"Signatures of all things I am here to read\"), Aristotle discusses sight as an avenue to understanding the reality of physical bodies. In his treatise On the Soul, as Gifford observes, the philosopher identifies color as the distinctive object of sight. And in his supplementary treatiseOn Sense and the Sensible he identifies the property of diaphanousness (transparency) as something that inheres to different degrees in all physical bodies and allows color also to inhere in them. The idea seems to be that light passes through bodies to varying degrees and bumps up against color as a kind of limit to the transparency. From this analysis Stephen draws the not very earthshaking (but amusingly phrased) conclusion that Aristotle was a materialist: \"Limits of the diaphane. But he adds: in bodies. Then he was aware of them bodies before of them coloured.\"\n Soon, though, Stephen is reeling back into the mystical way of understanding experience. He takes his own advice to \"Shut your eyes and see,\" but what he wants to see is the apocalyptic disappearance of the created universe: \"Am I walking into eternity along Sandymount strand?\" This thought experiment fails, however, and empiricism wins the day: \"Open your eyes now. I will. One moment. Has all vanished since? If I open and am for ever in the black adiaphane. Basta! I will see if I can see. See now. There all the time without you: and ever shall be, world without end.\"\n The phrase \"world without end\" is not only part of a Christian doxology but also a fair description of Aristotle's understanding of matter. In the Physics Aristotle argues that in some form the world must have existed forever, with no beginning in time, because all existent things (which he understands as formed matter) come into being from some preexisting matter, and to suppose that the matter itself came into existence from preexisting matter involves one in an infinite regress.\n Six sentences later in Proteus Stephen will think of the Christian idea of \"Creation from nothing,\" which contradicts Aristotle's conception of eternally existent matter. But there is good reason to suppose that Joyce is seriously advancing the Aristotelian conception when Stephen thinks \"world without end.\" The Linati schema identifies the \"sense\" of the episode as \"Prima materia (ΠΡΟΤΕΥΣ)\". Prima materia (an alchemical term meaning first matter) is a concept whose origin is often attributed to Aristotle, and by identifying it with PROTEUS Joyce seems to be suggesting that eternally existing matter is the stuff from which all the protean shapeshifting of life emerges."

  "030040arius": {
    "note": " Having considered the original controversy surrounding the Trinitarian doctrine of consubstantiality, Stephen goes on in Proteus to think in more personal terms of \"poor dear Arius,\" a 4th century Christian bishop who met a very bad end, first being judged a \"heresiarch\" whose books should be burned, and then dying a painful and degrading death.",
    "expandedNote": " Only in part did Arius' ill fortune consist in having his teachings condemned by the First Council of Nicaea in 325. This clarification of church doctrine came about at the instigation of the Emperor Constantine, who had legitimized Christianity in the 310s and called the Council in order to consolidate its widely divergent teachings. After the Council acted, the Emperor gave order that Arius should be exiled, that all of his books should be burned, and that anyone who hid a copy should be put to death, \"so that not only will the wickedness of his teaching be obliterated, but nothing will be left even to remind anyone of him\" (\"Edict by Emperor Constantine against the Arians\"). None of Arius' writings are known to exist today, and knowledge of what he said and wrote comes mostly from characterizations in works by writers who were hostile to his views. For the next several centuries Arian churches, which were widespread throughout the territories of the Roman Empire and spread into many Germanic lands, were converted to the true faith either at the point of the sword or by negotiation.\n After some years, however, the Emperor allowed Arius to return from exile, and in 336 he ordered the Bishop of Constantinople to receive him and give him Holy Communion. Gifford notes that \"That ministration would have been public evidence that Arius was no longer excommunicant, but Arius died before it took place.\" Socrates Scholasticus, an opponent, writes that the day before he was to visit the church, after leaving the imperial palace and walking proudly through the city streets with supporters, \"a terror arising from the remorse of conscience seized Arius, and with the terror a violent relaxation of the bowels.\" Directed to a public toilet, \"Soon after a faintness came over him, and together with the evacuations his bowels protruded, followed by a copious hemorrhage, and the descent of the smaller intestines: moreover portions of his spleen and liver were brought off in the effusion of blood, so that he almost immediately died\" (\"The Death of Arius\"). Whatever exactly may have happened on that toilet and inside his body, Arius' excruciating death provided lasting evidence to his opponents of divine displeasure. Gifford directs interested readers to the Adversus Haereses of Epiphanius (a man who was about 20 years old at the time of the death) for \"a splendidly one-sided account.\" \n Stephen thinks, \"Illstarred heresiarch. In a Greek watercloset he breathed his last: euthanasia. With beaded mitre and with crozier, stalled upon his throne, widower of a widowed see, with upstiffed omophorion, with clotted hinderparts.\" He clearly is using the word \"euthanasia\" (Greek for a good death) sardonically, and likewise the word \"throne\": instead of sitting glorified in a bishop's chair with \"mitre\" (the bishop's tall, two-pointed hat), \"crozier\" (the bishop's long, sheephook staff), and \"omophorion\" (the bishop's long stole of embroidered white silk), Arius comes down through history disastrously \"stalled\" on the seat of a public toilet, divorced from his \"see,\" the church in Alexandria from which he was deposed as pastor in 321. (A \"widowed see\" is a recognized expression for a diocese temporarily without a bishop.) \n Presumably the historical Arius, stripped of all his titles and responsibilities, did not actually die with a bishop's vestments and appurtenances in that watercloset. But Stephen imagines him that way. (Is his omophorion \"upstiffed\" because it has been employed in a vain effort to keep his vitals from exiting his body?) In Circe, Stephen looks back on the horrific scene he has conjured up in Proteus: \"But beware Antisthenes, the dog sage, and the last end of Arius Heresiarchus. The agony in the closet.\""

(Ltd.) which extends from Henry st. to Prince's st., [was] totally destroyed by fire' (Thom's 1904, p. 2105). The business was quickly rebuilt, and the drawing to the right gives some sense of its scale and grandeur at the time of the novel."

  "030037griffith": {
    "note": " \"Arthur Griffith\" (1871-1922) was an ardent nationalist who worked for independence first as a journalist and later as a politician. At the time represented in the novel, he was publishing a newspaper calledThe United Irishman and beginning to organize the political movement that in 1907 became Sinn Féin. It seems that Bloom has been involved in some of these negotiations. Joyce himself approved of Griffith's political program, though he did become involved in a tiff with him over \"those big words . . . which make us so unhappy.\"",
    "expandedNote": " Ulysses mentions Griffith a total of eight times, usually with admiration. In Proteus Kevin Egan talks to Stephen about Irish nationalistic aspirations: \"of hopes, conspiracies, of Arthur Griffith now.\" In Calypso Bloom recalls Griffith's witty observation about \"a homerule sun rising up in the northwest\" on the logo of the Freeman's Journal, and in Lotus Eaters he recalls that The United Irishman has joined Maud Gonne in attacking the Dublin prostitution trade that catered to uncurfewed British troops. In Lestrygonians Bloom thinks ambivalently that \"Arthur Griffith is a squareheaded fellow but he has no go in him for the mob,\" unlike the charismatic Charles Stewart Parnell. \n In Cyclops the rabidly patriotic barhounds seem to harbor some suspicions about the man (a fact that hardly works to his disfavor), and they suspect that Bloom has been working with him on the Sinn Féin project, \"John Wyse saying it was Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper.\" Molly too thinks that her husband has been involved, and though she feels sexual contempt for Griffith she registers Bloom's admiration: \"he was going about with some of them Sinner Fein lately or whatever they call themselves talking his usual trash and nonsense he says that little man he showed me without the neck is very intelligent the coming man Griffith is he well he doesnt look it thats all I can say.\" \n Joyce regarded the United Irishman as the best paper in Ireland and he supported Griffith's Sinn Féin policy as the only viable one, parliamentary reform having died with Parnell (Ellmann, 237). He approved Griffith's \"separatist idea\" of decolonializing Ireland because (as he wrote to Stanislaus) \"either Sinn Fein or Imperialism will conquer the present Ireland. If the Irish programme did not insist on the Irish language I suppose I could call myself a nationalist\" (237). \n He did, however, maintain detachment from all forms of political drum-beating. In December 1902 the young Joyce panned some patriotic poems by William Rooney that Griffith had published in the United Irishman, referring to \"those big words which make us so unhappy.\" The sentence annoyed Griffith \"so much that he used it derisively to advertise\" another author's book of patriotic poems which Joyce had negatively reviewed (Ellmann, 112). Far from repenting, Joyce was satisfied enough with the phrase to use it once again in Nestor, where Mr. Deasy pontificates about generosity and justice, prompting a gloomy reply from his employee: \"I fear those big words, Stephen said, which make us so unhappy.\"\n When the Irish War of Independence (1919-21) concluded in the Anglo-Irish Treaty founding a semi-independent Free State, Griffith was elected its first President in January 1922, just before Ulysses appeared in print. It was \"a coincidence Joyce welcomed\" (Ellmann, 335)."

  "010052otherssee": {
    "note": " “As he and others see me”: seeing himself in the mirror held up by Mulligan, Stephen recalls two well-known lines of the Scottish poet Robert Burns (1759-96). Burns wrote, \"O wad some Power the giftie gie us / To see oursels as ithers see us!\" The thoughts that follow in Telemachus (\"Who chose this face for me? This dogsbody to rid of vermin\") make clear that Stephen knows the whole poem and is thinking about its message: objective representation threatens subjective self-satisfaction, and the body humbles the mind. Bloom knows the poem too, and thinks about its crucial line in similar ways.",
    "expandedNote": "Burns' lines come from a poem titled On a Louse: On seeing one on a lady’s bonnet at church, and they cannot be properly appreciated without contemplating the scene that is vividly set out in the poem's opening stanzas:\n Ha! Whare ye gaun, ye crowlin ferlie? \n Your impudence protects you sairly, \n I canna say but ye strut rarely \n Owre gauze and lace, \n Tho' faith! I fear ye dine but sparely \n On sic a place.\n Ye ugly, creepin, blastit wonner, \n Detested, shunn'd by saunt an' sinner, \n How daur ye set your fit upon her— \n Sae fine a lady! \n Gae somewhere else and seek your dinner\n On some poor body. \n Such a sight was all too common in turn-of-the-century Dublin. Stephen will think later in this episode of his mother picking lice off her children and squishing them between her fingernails. The image recalls a similar event in A Portrait, and also another moment in that book in which Stephen snatches a louse from his neck and rolls it between his fingers. On the latter occasion, the thought of being louse-infested makes him doubt the value of his exquisite intelligence.\nBurns pursues similar thoughts about how the body's infirmities can humble the mind's pretensions. The image of an ugly, creeping, blasted louse crawling over a respectable and presumably self-pleased lady leads him to his moral at the end of the poem:\n O wad some Power the giftie gie us \n To see oursels as ithers see us!\n It wad frae monie a blunder free us, \n An' foolish notion: \n What airs in dress an' gait wad lea'e us, \n An' ev'n devotion!\n People are liberated, Burns asserts, by their ability to see themselves objectively—i.e., as objects, from the outside—because the reality of our existence never quite measures up to our flattering self-conceptions. Shortly after Stephen thinks of Burns while looking at himself in the mirror, Mulligan alludes to an Oscar Wilde saying about mirrors that has similar implications of unflattering self-knowledge.\nIn Lestrygonians, Bloom recalls Burns’ famous line as he watches men “wolfing gobfuls of sloppy food”: “Am I like that? See ourselves as others see us. Hungry man is an angry man.” Shortly later he associates it with a similar line from Hamlet, thinking, \"Look on this picture then on that.\" At this moment in act 3 scene 4, Hamlet forces his mother to look at portraits of her first and second husbands. Just as Hamlet forces Gertrude to behold Claudius' ugliness and think about herself (\"O Hamlet, speak no more: / Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul; / And there I see such black and grained spots / As will not leave their tinct\"), Bloom beholds ugliness and wonders about himself. \n He is still thinking along such lines in Nausicaa. When an unknown “nobleman” passes by on the beach after supper, Bloom imagines following him to observe what he is like: “Walk after him now make him awkward like those newsboys me today. Still you learn something. See ourselves as others see us. So long as women don’t mock what matter?”"

  "010099ashplant": {
    "note": " An \"ashplant\" is a walking stick fashioned from an ash sapling that has been cut off below the surface of the soil, supplying a natural handle. Stephen may have begun carrying his for protection against dogs, but he thinks of it as also possessing various kinds of magical power.",
    "expandedNote": " In a personal communication, Don Gifford has told me that the main root of many ash saplings takes a horizontal bend for several inches, just below the surface, before continuing its downward path. In a chapter on the ashplant (27-32) in James Joyce's Disunited Kingdom and the Irish Dimension (Gill and Macmillan, 1976), John Garvin offers the same information about the ashplant's origins in an uprooted sapling. He adds that it is typically seasoned in a chimney and filled with molten lead. Garvin speculates that Joyce acquired his ashplant during one of his visits to Mullingar and surrounding parts of Westmeath in 1900 and 1901. \n Stephen’s ashplant has a “ferrule,” a metal ring or cap placed at the end of the shaft to keep it from splitting or wearing down. In Telemachus the “squealing” of the metal scraping against stone makes him think of a “familiar,” the supernatural animal-like spirit which attends a magician. He imagines this little spirit calling \"Steeeeeeeeeeeephen!\" as he walks along dragging the stick behind him. \n At the beginning of Proteus, Stephen thinks, \"My ash sword hangs at my side.\" Later in the chapter, he lifts his ashplant by its “hilt” as if it were a sword, “lunging with it softly.” This playful action anticipates a climactic action in Circe, when Stephen cries, “Nothung!”—the name of the magic sword in Wagner’s Ring cycle—and raises it over his head with both hands to smash the chandelier in the brothel. Gifford notes that in the second of the four operas in the cycle, Die Walküre, the god Wotan has planted this sword “in the heart of a giant ash tree” (emphasis added). Siegfried’s father Siegmund pulls the sword from the tree, and in the final opera of the cycle, Die Götterdämmerung, Siegfried unwittingly uses the magic of Nothung to bring about the Twilight of the Gods.\n The Wagnerian magical subtext empowers Stephen. When he smashes the chandelier he is violently resisting his mother’sfiendish call to repent and return to God’s grace. The ruin of the lamp makes him think of the “ruin of all space” and time: the destruction of the divinely constituted order which he has been contemplating ever since Nestor.\n In Proteus Stephen calls his stick \"my augur's rod of ash,\" linking it with another kind of magical power. Just as the shape of the stick has allowed him to think of it as a sword with a hilt, so now it becomes a lituus, a staff with one curved end that Roman priests used to consecrate a sector of the sky before reading the appearance of birds for omens. The priests' staffs were elaborately curved, like the crozier of a Christian bishop, but earlier Etruscan brass horns, also called litui, had shapes more exactly approximating Stephen's walking stick. Apparently, the name originally referred to a shepherd's crook.\n Joyce thought of his own ashplant as distinctively Irish, and it has been suggested that Stephen's stick should also be seen as embodying the prophetic power of the ancient Irish filí, or bards."

    "expandedNote": " The complete text of the poem is as follows:\n Ask nothing more of me, sweet; \n All I can give you I give. \n Heart of my heart, were it more, \n More would be laid at your feet: \n Love that should help you to live, \n Song that should spur you to soar. \n All things were nothing to give \n Once to have sense of you more, \n Touch you and taste of you sweet, \n Think you and breathe you and live, \n Swept of your wings as they soar, \n Trodden by chance of your feet. \n I that have love and no more \n Give you but love of you, sweet: \n He that hath more, let him give; \n He that hath wings, let him soar; \n Mine is the heart at your feet \n Here, that must love you to live.\n As Thornton observes, the song was set to music in Swinburne's lifetime by Theophile Marzials.

  "110002atfourshe": {
    "note": " For all its maniacal specificity, Ulysses contains numerous omissions, mysteries, lacunae, silences. One of the more important ones is the question of how Bloom knows that Boylan is planning to visit Molly at 4:00. In Sirens he thinks, \"At four, she said.\" The thought becomes a repeated motif over the next few pages: \"At four. . . . At four she. . . . At four he. All said four. . . . At four.\" The action of Sirens proves Bloom right: Boylan leaves the bar a few minutes after 4:00. But the book does not represent any conversation in which Bloom receives this information from his wife. How does he know?",
    "expandedNote": " In a valuable article, \"The Rhetoric of Silence,\" JJQ 14.4 (Summer 1977): 382-94, Hugh Kenner addresses this and other narrative ellipses, arguing that Joyce intended them just as carefully as he intended the novel's countless precise details. He observes that Calypso ends with the sound of the church bells signifying \"Quarter to,\" leaving fifteen minutes \"set aside for a major scene that Joyce does not write at all: the scene in which Bloom takes leave of Molly for the day, in the knowledge that when he sees her again she will have cuckolded him.\" \"It would be callow and un-Bloomlike to just slip out through the front door\" after using the privy, Kenner argues. \"And he would have meant to retrieve his latchkey too, from the trousers in the bedroom wardrobe, though given the emotional import of the scene it is not surprising that in fact he forgot it again\" (385).\n But Joyce provides more than mere speculation to go on. In Lotus Eaters, when Bloom is talking to M'Coy, he thinks of his wife still in bed with her \"Blackened court cards laid along her thigh,\" and \"Cat furry black ball. Torn strip of envelope.\" She had called to the cat to come join her when Bloom left for the outhouse, and the torn strip of envelope from Boylan's letter further marks the day as June 16. In Penelope Molly too thinks of laying out her tarot cards \"this morning,\" and she adds another detail: \"he said Im dining out and going to the Gaiety.\" So, Kenner infers, Molly must have told her husband during this final meeting in the bedroom that Boylan was coming at 4, and Leopold must have given her reason to think that he would not interrupt the lovers, by declaring an intention to eat out and then attend a show at the Gaiety Theatre.\n Why does Joyce not represent the conversation? It must have been an exceedingly awkward one, and many awkward topics are glossed over by silence in the Blooms' house. Kenner writes, \"We ought to observe, in this connection, how much silence pervades such of their conversation as we do hear. They are agreed to pretend that Blazes Boylan is coming to hear Molly sing. They agree to regard the concert tour as a fund-raising project. They are agreed that Molly may put Boylan's letter not quite under the pillow, and that Leopold will see it, and that she will see him see it, and that neither will comment. They agree that 'Mrs Marion' will pass without remark. They are so much agreed on all this that they even agree to let the time of Boylan's arrival be unspecified—a casual drop-in merely?—until (in that hidden interview) either Bloom asks for the time of the assignation or Molly volunteers it, on the shared understanding that Poldy must know how long to stay out of the house. Their conversation is guided by a set of elaborate agreements not to ask, not to comment\" (388). Joyce's representation of the conspiratorial silences in a sexual relationship rivals that of Shakespeare's sonnet 138. \n Bloom's pretext is plausible enough. Lotus Eaters discloses that \"Mrs Bandman Palmer\" is performing in Leah \"tonight,\" and not only does Bloom appreciate her acting, but the play holds deep meaning for him. In the next chapter, Hades, he thinks that perhaps Martin Cunningham could secure him a complimentary \"pass for the Gaiety.\" Near the end of Nausicaa he thinks that it's \"Too late for Leah,\" and in Ithaca he reflects on his having failed \"to obtain admission (gratuitous or paid) to the performance of Leah by Mrs Bandmann Palmer at the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South King street.\" But in Circe, in a fantasized encounter, he tells Josie Breen, \"I was at Leah. Mrs Bandmann Palmer.\" And he tells his wife the same thing at the end of Ithaca. It is psychologically interesting that, even after the cuckolding, Bloom feels compelled to uphold his end of the shared lie."

  "060004athos": {
    "note": " Bloom's father Rudolph apparently named his dog \"Athos\" after the character in Alexandre Dumas' The Three Musketeers, but there also seems to be an echo of Odysseus' dog, who has the very similar name of Argos. Argos perks up and then dies after seeing Odysseus, who left for Troy 19 years earlier. Bloom thinks in Hades that Athos too \"took it to heart, pined away\" when his master died.",
    "expandedNote": " In Book 17 of the Odyssey Eumaeus and Odysseus pass by an impressive-looking old dog lying in piles of dung and covered with fleas. The dog raises his head, pricks up his ears, wags his tails, and then loses the strength to hold his ears up, much less to approach his old master. The disguised Odysseus wipes away a tear and questions Eumaeus about the handsome animal. After telling the beggar about the dog's glory days, the noble man who raised him from a puppy, and the duties that are forgotten when a lord goes away, Eumaeus goes into the palace to tend to the needs of the insolent suitors. Argos, having finally seen the man he longed for, gives up the ghost.\n Bloom, who is kind to stray dogs (in Circe he gives one the meat he has bought, and in Eumaeus he remembers Molly's vexation when he tried to bring one home), remembers his father's instructions in his suicide note: \"Be good to Athos, Leopold, is my last wish.\" He recalls the note again in Ithaca: \"be kind to Athos, Leopold...,\" remembering Athos as \"an infirm dog.\""

  "030145augursrod": {
    "note": " In addition to the Germanic powers that he associates with his ashplant, and possibly some ancient Celtic ones as well, Stephen thinks of it in Proteus as his \"augur's rod of ash,\" associating it with Roman powers of divination.",
    "expandedNote": " Roman augurs were priests who divined the will of the gods by observing the flight of birds. They carried a rod or wand called a lituus, which (like Stephen's ashplant) was curved at one end. With it they ritually consecrated a space in the sky called a templum, and then made observations of the birds that passed through this sector: what kinds, how many, flying in which directions, traveling singly or in groups, making which sounds. Only certain species of birds yielded significations, and the hermeneutics were complex. These observations, called \"taking the auspices,\" served as favorable (\"auspicious\") or unfavorable omens for important activities like waging battles or erecting buildings. \n In the last chapter of A Portrait of the Artist, Stephen stands on the steps of the National Library watching the flight of various birds, counting them, listening to their cries and wingbeats, wondering what kinds they are, noting the direction of their flights. Twice, the narrative calls the space in which the birds are flying \"a temple of air,\" \"an airy temple of the tenuous sky.\" And Stephen thinks, \"Why was he gazing upwards from the steps of the porch, hearing their shrill twofold cry, watching their flight? For an augury of good or evil?\" In Scylla and Charybdis, standing once again on \"The portico\" of the library, he remembers, \"Here I watched the birds for augury.\"\n Stephen's reference to his ashplant as an augur's rod in a late paragraph of Proteus probably bears some connection to his thoughts about George Berkeley in that paragraph, because Berkeley too advocated the reading of \"signs\" in the visible universe. Gifford observes that the phrase \"Signs on a white field,\" five sentences later, refers not only to the scraps of verse that Stephen is writing down on a corner of Deasy's letter but also to \"birds (as the augur sees them) against the sky.\" The first mention of \"The good bishop\" follows two sentences after that."

  "020021averromonides": {
    "note": " Stephen appears to link \"Averroes and Moses Maimonides\" because both of them sought to reconcile Aristotle's pagan Greek philosophy with revealed religion—Islam in Averroes' case, Judaism in Maimonides'.",
    "expandedNote": " Averroes (1126-98) was a Muslim philosopher and polymath in medieval Andalusia (Stephen has been thinking of the medieval \"Moors\") who wrote commentaries on most of Aristotle's works, which he read in Arabic translations. At the time when Averroes began writing, ancient Neoplatonic ideas had been incorporated into Christianity, but Aristotle had been largely forgotten. Averroes' commentaries on the Greek master's works exerted a powerful influence on Christian Scholastic philosophers, who extended the Averroistic synthesis of theism and Aristotelianism into their own religion. (Thomas Aquinas referred to Averroes simply, and reverently, as The Commentator. Aristotle was The Philosopher.) Gifford observes that \"While he strove to reconcile Aristotle with Moslem orthodoxy (with heavy emphasis on God the Creator), he was suspected by the Moslem world of heterodoxy.\" \n Maimonides (1135-1204) was a Jewish philosopher, rabbinical scholar, and physician. He was born in the same city as Averroes, Córdoba, nine years later, and lived in Morocco (where Averroes died) and Egypt. His 14-volume commentary on the Torah still is regarded as canonical, famed for its logical structure, its clarity, and its vast learning. A man of scientific intelligence, he also adapted Aristotelian thought to philosophizing about questions of faith. In this latter endeavor more than a whiff of heterodoxy attends him, just as it did Averroes. Many sophisticated Jews of early thirteenth century Spain and southern France were inspired by Maimonides' philosophy to reject traditional forms of belief and observance. For a discussion of this history, see D. J. Silver, Maimonidean Criticism and the Maimonidean Controversy, 1180-1240 (1965). \n The paired figures of Averroes and Moses Maimonides return, very strangely, in Oxen of the Sun, when Stephen cites them as joint authorities on one of the circumstances under which women may become pregnant without intercourse. Gifford notes that Averroes did indeed write about the case history of a woman impregnated in her bath by a man bathing nearby, but that Maimonides has nothing to say on this topic.\n Bloom thinks in Ithaca that Maimonides was a thinker of \"such eminence that from Moses (of Egypt) to Moses (Mendelssohn) there arose none like Moses (Maimonides).\""

  "030084awfullyholy": {
    "note": " Turning away from his thoughts about priests, Stephen recalls a time when he seemed to be heading toward that vocation: \"You were awfully holy, weren't you?\" This period of the character's life was narrated in part 4 of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.",
    "expandedNote": " Part 2 of A Portrait concludes with young Stephen'sfirst visit to a prostitute. Part 3 is devoted to his spiritual wrestling with that carnal choice, fueled in no small measure by a religious retreat in which a gifted preacher does his magniloquent best to inspire sheer terror in his young charges. For the impressionable and imaginative Stephen, the horrific scene-painting of hellish tortures works. Desperate, he confesses to a priest at the end of the chapter and is granted \"Another life! A life of grace and virtue and happiness! It was true. It was not a dream from which he would wake. The past was past.\"\n Part 4 begins, however, with a sardonic tone suggesting that this new life offers no release from the banal drudgery, baffled desire, and self-delusion of other forms of life. Stephen throws himself into a heroic regimen of perpetual worship. He mortifies every form of sensory pleasure and desire. He agonizes over whether he has truly changed, and seeks new forms of repentance. But an air of futility hangs over the whole enterprise, accentuated at moments by savage authorial irony: \"His life seemed to have drawn near to eternity; every thought, word and deed, every instance of consciousness could be made to revibrate radiantly in heaven: and at times his sense of such immediate repercussion was so lively that he seemed to feel his soul in devotion pressing like fingers the keyboard of a great cash register and to see the amount of his purchase start forth immediately in heaven, not as a number but as a frail column of incense or as a slender flower.\" \n By the time represented in Ulysses, Stephen has progressed far enough in self-knowledge that he can take over from the narrator the job of mocking his spiritual ambitions: \"You prayed to the Blessed Virgin that you might not have a red nose. You prayed to the devil in Serpentine avenue that the fubsy widow in front might lift her clothes still more from the wet street.\" As the confusion of spiritual and sexual desires here would suggest, Stephen found that the religious life did not satisfy his keenest longings. At the end of Part 4 of A Portrait, when offered an opportunity to enter the priesthood, he walks away from it to pursue his calling as an artist and seek carnal love."

    "note": " Richie Goulding apparently works in bed because of back pains. In Proteus, Stephen imagines himself turning down Richie's offer of a hot breakfast, and Richie replying, \"Sure? So much the better. We have nothing in the house but backache pills.\" Bloom thinks several times, compassionately, of Goulding's back problems, and, sardonically, of his patent medicine cure. He believes that Goulding's problems are a symptom of \"Bright's\" disease, a kidney ailment thought to have been caused by excessive alcohol consumption—a belief that coheres with Stephen's assumption that Richie would be calling for \"Whusky!\" in the morning hours.",
    "expandedNote": " Soon after the funeral carriage sets out in Hades, Bloom notices Stephen walking in Irishtown and points him out to Simon Dedalus, who infers that he has probably been visiting his Aunt Sara Goulding. Bloom's thoughts turn to Sara's husband: \"His jokes are getting a bit damp. Great card he was. Waltzing in Stamer street with Ignatius Gallaher on a Sunday morning, the landlady's two hats pinned on his head. Out on the rampage all night. Beginning to tell on him now: that backache of his, I fear. Wife ironing his back. Thinks he'll cure it with pills. All breadcrumbs they are. About six hundred per cent profit.\"\n In Sirens, as he is dining with Goulding at the Ormond Hotel, Bloom's compassionate eyes notice a wince of pain: \"Tenderly Bloom over liverless bacon saw the tightened features strain. Backache he. Bright's bright eye. Next item on the programme. Paying the piper. Pills, pounded bread, worth a guinea a box. Stave it off awhile.\" Bright's disease was a 19th century name for certain kidney ailments that today are classed as acute or chronic nephritis. Back pain is one of the most common symptoms, but a \"bright eye,\" Gifford observes, was also supposed to be a sign of the disease, and excessive alcohol consumption was regarded as one of its causes. Bloom's judgment that Goulding is \"Paying the piper\" for alcoholism coheres with what he has thought in Hades: Goulding used to be \"Out on the rampage all night,\" and it is \"beginning to tell on him now.\" Kidney disease is the \"Next item on the programme\" for this long-term alcoholic, and pills may \"Stave it off awhile,\" but they won't cure Goulding's problem any more than having his wife iron his back will."

  "080007ballastoffice": {
    "note": " Looking south from the O'Connell bridge in Lestrygonians, Bloom sees the four-story Ballast Office, which stood at the corner of Aston Quay where Westmoreland Street begins running south from the river. The building served as a reliable timekeeper for the City and the Port of Dublin. Over the front door, on the outside wall of the second story, perched a large clock known for accuracy. On the northeast corner of the building's roof a large copper ball descended every day at 1:00. Bloom sees that the ball has fallen: \"After one. Timeball on the ballastoffice is down. Dunsink time.\" He is wrong about the Dunsink time, but he corrects his mistake later in the chapter.",
    "expandedNote": " The copper ball, four feet in diameter, had a wooden pole through its center, allowing it to be raised and lowered. Gifford notes that it was rigged close to the river \"so that ships' chronometers could be checked\" (accurate chronometers were vital for calculating longitude at sea). The time ball dropped each day at 1:00 PM Greenwich Mean Time, the international standard. Ireland, however, was on Dunsink time, 25 minutes and 21 seconds behind Greenwich time. This time was determined by the Dunsink Observatory north of Phoenix Park and communicated directly to the Ballast Office by a five-mile telegraph wire. The observatory time (wired also to Trinity College, the General Post Office, and the Bank of Ireland) was accurate to within one second per week. \n From seeing that the ball has come down, Bloom judges that the time is \"After one.\" But on Irish time the ball fell just before 12:35. If he were to walk down Westmoreland Street and look at the clock on the building's wall, it might display some time earlier than 1:00. Later in Lestrygonians, returning to his earlier thoughts, he remembers that the ball and the clock show different times: \"Now that I come to think of it, that ball falls at Greenwich time. It's the clock is worked by an electric wire from Dunsink.\"\n In Cyclops the Ballast Office puts in one more brief appearance as the Flotilla Bloom floats majestically down the Liffey toward open water: \"Amid cheers that rent the welkin, responded to by answering cheers from a big muster of henchmen on the distant Cambrian and Caledonian hills, the mastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final floral tribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were present in large numbers while, as it proceeded down the river, escorted by a flotilla of barges, the flags of the Ballast office and Custom House were dipped in salute as were also those of the electrical power station at the Pigeonhouse and the Poolbeg Light.\" The Custom House sits across the river, and slightly downstream, from the site of the Ballast Office.\n The Ballast Office was owned by the Dublin Port and Docks Board, the governing entity which had replaced the Ballast Board in 1876. The Board maintained offices on the ground and top floors, while the second and third floors held the offices of Irish Shipping Limited. This building, with its time ball on the roof for the benefit of shipping interests, was a vital commercial hub in the days when oceangoing ships could sail up the Liffey all the way to Carlisle (O'Connell) Bridge.\n Today the docks do not reach so far upriver. The Port and the City have become substantially separate entities, and the Ballast Office was demolished in the 1970s to make room for a new office block. However, the builders erected a \"pastiche\" replica of the old building's facade to conceal the new one."

  "140003balmofgilead": {
    "note": " The \"Junius\"-like voice which accuses Bloom of hypocrisy for criticizing the rowdy young wankers in the hospital when he himself is guilty of substituting masturbation for conjugal bliss describes his moral pronouncements as a \"balm of Gilead.\" The reference would seem to be to a biblical-era healing substance, but Joyce seems also to be slyly alluding to a late 18th century patent medicine that was produced and marketed by a hugely successful Irish-born Jewish doctor.",
    "expandedNote": " Jeremiah 8:22 asks, \"Is there no balm in Gilead; is there no physician there? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?\" Jeremiah 46:11 similarly associates the substance with healing: \"Go up into Gilead, and take balm, o virgin, the daughter of Egypt: in vain shalt thou use many medicines; for thou shalt not be cured.\" Genesis 37:25 mentions the trafficking of \"spicery and balm and myrrh\" from Gilead to Egypt, suggesting that it was a precious substance on the trade routes, and Ezekiel 27:17 too refers to the trade in balm. Gifford comments that trees in the mountainous Gilead region produced \"a liquid resinous substance worth twice its weight in silver that was prized for its fragrance and for its medicinal virtues as a 'heal-all.'\" Thornton, Johnson, and Slote all agree with this attribution.\n But the relevant sentence in Oxen of the Sun sounds less suited to precious biblical essences than to an age of crass mass-marketing: \"If he must dispense his balm of Gilead in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste to restore to health a generation of unfledged profligates let his practice better consist with the doctrines that now engross him.\" It seems odd that the surpassingly rare product of ancient Jordanian trees—reportedly given to King Solomon by the Queen of Sheba, and to the Pharaoh by Jacob, to win influence—should be \"dispensed\" to cure an entire \"generation.\" A \"nostrum\" usually denotes a patent medicine or quack remedy peddled by a healer of dubious credentials. And while the dubious \"taste\" of Bloom's advice perhaps applies in an abstract metaphorical sense to his \"apothegms,\" it is just as reasonable to hear the sentence suggesting that his nostrums, far from possessing the exquisite fragrance of ancient balm, have the unpalatable flavor of snake oil.\n So it is satisfying to discover (as I did thanks to a personal communication from Vincent Altman O'Connor) that \"Cordial Balm of Gilead\" was in fact an Enlightenment-era quasi-medical nostrum manufactured in Liverpool and sold for very high prices all around the world (the U.K., Europe, America, India). Although by some accounts it contained spices from the Holy Land and even dissolved gold, it was almost certainly compounded of much less expensive ingredients. The purveyor, a doctor named Samuel Solomon, grew up in Cork, opened a shop of medical remedies in Dublin around 1768, and in 1789 moved his operation to Liverpool, where he wrote a book that was re-issued many times and became quite wealthy from sales of his bottled elixir.\n A scholarly article by Gabriel Sivan, \"Samuel Solomon (1745-1819): quack or entrepreneur?,\" Jewish Historical Studies 42 (2009): 23-51, gives a balanced account of Dr. Solomon's life, his medical credentials, his business ventures, and his shameless marketing. Near the end of the article Sivan cites Louis Hyman's The Jews of Ireland to support his belief that Joyce \"knew all about\" Solomon, and he quotes from Oxen of the Sun, but he offers no thoughts about how or why Joyce may have made use of this historical material.\n There is a good deal more to say. The sentence quoted above does not just vaguely evoke the language of patent medicine dealers. It exactly reproduces the name of Dr. Solomon's cure-all, and virtually quotes from one of his advertisements, reproduced in the second image here. Joyce's sentence says that Bloom dispenses his nostrums and apothegms \"to restore to health a generation of unfledged profligates.\" Solomon's ad promises to help both the young and those suffering the lasting ill effects of their youth: \"Those who in an advanced life feel the consequences of youthful excess,or unfortunate youth who have brought on themselves a numerous train of evils, will, by the use of this, find themselves restored to health and strength, and all the melancholy symptoms removed, which are the general effects of such causes.\" \n Both sentences sound as if they are euphemistically referring to harms incurred by the raging hormones of youth. Solomon did indeed target people who engaged in the compensatory sexual pleasures available to \"unfledged profligates,\" Joyce's sly term for people with more desires than opportunities for performance. Sivan observes that, along with sufferers of other ailments, the elixir \"was also 'recommended to boys, young men and those who in the prime of life feel the consequences of a secret vice [i.e. masturbation], too frequent among youth, especially in the great Schools.' . . . Solomon knew how to play on the sexual fears of young men and women and conceived a devastating sales pitch\" (35). \n With his usual uncanny genius, Joyce appears to have found a small detail that ties together numerous threads in this section of Oxen of the Sun. Solomon's balm hails from a time roughly contemporary with the satiric style being employed in the chapter. (If Gifford is correct in associating the voice with that of the pseudonymous \"Junius,\" then we are in the late 1760s and early 1770s. Dr. Solomon began selling medical remedies in the late 1760s and launched the Cordial Balm of Gilead in 1796.) The balm purported to cure evils arising from ungratified sexual desire—a perfect metaphor for Bloom's criticism of the young men's rowdy talk. And the dispenser of the nostrum was Jewish. \n Of all the stylistic experiments in Oxen, the Junius section is the only one to indulge anti-Semitic sentiments. It begins by asking, \"But with what fitness, let it be asked of the noble lord, his patron, has this alien, whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted to civic rights, constituted himself the lord paramount of our internal polity?\" One can hear in this sentence the same considerations that lead Mr. Deasy in Nestor to claim that Ireland has never persecuted the Jews \"because she never let them in\" (a claim belied by the fact that in 1174 King Henry II assigned possession and protection of the Jews in Ireland to one of his Anglo-Norman lords), and that lead Bloom in Eumaeus to observe that \"Spain decayed when the inquisition hounded the jews out and England prospered when Cromwell, an uncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer for, imported them.\" \n The use of the word \"stranger\" at several points in Oxen suggests that Mulligan and perhaps others in the hospital lounge, rather than viewing Bloom as an outwardly successful middle-aged man from whom they might learn something, regard his ethnicity with suspicion. What better way for a savage satirist of the late 18th century to convey this distrust than to characterize Bloom as a rich physician who peddles fraudulent medicines because he is, after all, only \"a dirty jew\"? (The words appear in Bloom's thoughts about Reuben J. Dodd in Lestrygonians.)\n The Oxen passage brings balm back from Liverpool to ancient Palestine with a second mention one sentence later by remarking that Bloom, \"this new exponent of morals and healer of ills,\" is \"at his best an exotic tree which, when rooted in its native orient, throve and flourished and was abundant in balm but, transplanted to a clime more temperate, its roots have lost their quondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant, acid, and inoperative.\" Jews, in other words, should stay in their own country. And while Jewish balm may have been quite the thing in its time, the adulterated European version is a poor substitute."

  "040029bankholiday": {
    "note": " Bloom thinks that the \"August bank holiday\" might be a good time to pay a visit to Milly in Mullingar, because he would have a three-day weekend. Bank holidays are days when the banks are closed, and some of them, including the first Monday in August, coincide with public holidays when other businesses close down. Irish people refer to public holidays colloquially as bank holidays, as Molly may be doing when she thinks, \"not a bank holiday.\"",
    "expandedNote": " In 1871 the Bank Holidays Act in the UK Parliament established Easter Monday, Whit Monday (just after Pentecost, which is the seventh Sunday after Easter), St. Stephen's Day (or Boxing Day, just after Christmas), and the first Monday in August as bank holidays. Banks were already closed on other important holidays like Good Friday and Christmas, and the Bank Holiday Act of 1903, introduced by an Irish MP, added St. Patrick's Day (March 17). So by 1904 there were many bank holidays, not all of them \"bank holidays\" in the popular sense of general public holidays. \n Gifford notes that the August bank holiday is a \"long holiday weekend not unlike Labor Day weekend in the United States.\" It also is an oasis in a desert, with no other holidays for a couple of months before and after. So it readily suggests itself to Bloom as a good time for a late-summer getaway from the city."

    "note": " Stephen and Patrice drank in \"the bar MacMahon,\" named for the Irish Frenchman Patrice de Mac Mahon, perhaps the most illustrious descendant of the Wild Geese who left Ireland in the 17th and 18th centuries. He was Duke of Magenta, Marshall of France, and President of the Third Republic.",
    "expandedNote": " MacMahon's forebears descended from the Dalcassians, lost ancestral lands during Cromwell's depredations in the 1650s, and left Ireland in the 1690s after the Catholic lords' disastrous support for England's deposed Stuart king, James II. Groomed for a career as a military officer, Patrice rose through the ranks of the French army from the 1820s through the 1850s and achieved the rank of Marshall in 1859. As a conservative politician in the 1870s, he remained committed to the ancient French aristocratic order but positioned himself somewhat precariously as a figure who could rise above the struggle between monarchists and republicans. His term as the French president ended unhappily in 1879 with a Republican electoral triumph. He died in 1893.\n The Avenue Mac-Mahon in the 17th arrondissement is one of the dozen major Parisian thoroughfares that converge on the Arc de Triomphe, and has been so named since 1875.

  "030129barnaclegoose": {
    "note": " In a simple sentence with very complex associations, Stephen considers fish feeding on the corpse of the drowned man: \"God becomes man becomes fish becomes barnacle goose becomes featherbed mountain.\" The associative logic of the sentence is partly scientific, partly spiritualist, partly theological, partly legendary, partly erotic, partly mythographic—and fully poetic. Its emotional implications are largely positive.",
    "expandedNote": " The paragraph in which the sentence appears suggests a bleakly materialistic context for Stephen's thoughts: \"Bag of corpsegas sopping in foul brine. A quiver of minnows, fat of a spongy titbit, flash through the slits of his buttoned trouserfly. . . . Dead breaths I living breathe, tread dead dust, devour a urinous offal from all dead. Hauled stark over the gunwale he breathes upward the stench of his green grave, his leprous nosehole snoring to the sun.\" Bodies decaying and bloating, infecting and consuming other bodies, excreting waste until they themselves become waste to be recycled by other organisms: these thoughts are consistent with the meditations on mortality that Stephen has conducted throughout the chapter, looking at broken seashells and dead dogs and recognizing their kinship with human beings. The animate no less than the inanimate world is an endless shuffling of essentially \"dead\" materials. Everything is in flux; no one survives the process of endless change. Leopold Bloom will think similar thoughts in Hades.\n But life does persist, and it seems to obey—if only whimsically, fancifully—laws of metempsychosis and metamorphosis that Stephen has also been pondering throughout the chapter. A dog can transform before one's eyes into a hare, a horse, a deer, a bear, a cow, a wolf, a leopard, a panther, a vulture; waves appear to be walruses, serpents, and \"the steeds of Mananaan.\" Human beings become rabbits or geese or pigeons. People may remember events from other lives many centuries earlier, or reincarnate figures like Moses in the bulrushes, the Israelites in Babylon, or Lady Macbeth. All of life seems to be bound together by principles of interpenetration that call into question the finality of death. \n The Christian theology in which Stephen is steeped enters into his thinking: in the great mysterious act of Incarnation that transforms the immortal deity into mortal flesh, \"God becomes man.\" And then, somewhat more fancifully, \"man becomes fish\" because early Christians anagrammatically associated their Savior with the Greek word for fish. The letters of Ichthys spell out Christ's essential names and properties: Iota initiates Iesous, Jesus; Chi begins Christos, the Messiah or anointed one; Theta invokes Theos, God; Ypsilon begins Yios, Son; and Sigma spells Soter, Savior. (It is perhaps not too ingenious to hear also in this phrase the ritual of Communion in which God gives himself to man to be eaten, for when Jesus performed miracles of feeding the hungry he gave them fish.)\n Some geese do eat small fish, but the primary logic for the next transformation in Stephen's sentence is legendary. The \"barnacle goose,\" a medium-sized species with distinctive black and white coloring on its head, got its name from a medieval theory that these birds do not procreate in the normal way. According to Gerald of Wales, writing in the Topographia Hiberniae (1187), barnacle geese \"are produced from fir timber tossed along the sea, and are at first like gum. Afterwards they hang down by their beaks as if they were a seaweed attached to the timber, and are surrounded by shells in order to grow more freely. Having thus in process of time been clothed with a strong coat of feathers, they either fall into the water or fly freely away into the air. They derived their food and growth from the sap of the wood or from the sea, by a secret and most wonderful process of alimentation. I have frequently seen, with my own eyes, more than a thousand of these small bodies of birds, hanging down on the sea-shore from one piece of timber, enclosed in their shells, and already formed. They do not breed and lay eggs like other birds\" (quoted from Edward Heron-Allen, Barnacles in Nature and Myth [1928, rpt. 2003], p. 10). \n Fantastical as the ornithology may be, Gerald's description of the young birds' development does come pretty close to describing the domestic arrangement of barnacles, which attach to marine surfaces by their heads (\"hang down by their beaks as if they were a seaweed\"), grow thick shells as a protective home (\"surrounded by shells in order to grow more freely\"), and use their long delicate legs to trap food from the seawater and move it toward their mouths (\"clothed with a strong coat of feathers\"). It seems quite likely that Gerald's theory was based on close empirical observation of barnacles, but later writers elaborated more inventive accounts, as illustrated in the 16th century images here.\n This medieval association between small sea creatures and a particular bird explains how \"fish becomes barnacle goose.\" Stephen might have taken an interest in the legend not only because it was attached specifically to Ireland—for several centuries the Topography of Ireland gave other Europeans most of their information about that country—but also because churchmen squabbled for several centuries over whether the barnacle goose's unusual origins meant that it was really fish rather than flesh and therefore could be eaten on Fridays. This is the sort of rational theological absurdity that Stephen simply adores.\n But Barnacle was also the surname of the woman whom James Joyce chose for his spouse: after meeting her, John Joyce ventured his opinion that \"she will stick.\" This surname cannot be present in Stephen's consciousness, but he is walking on Sandymount Strand on 16 June 1904, the very day when Joyce walked out there with Nora and had a transformative sexual experience, and several paragraphs earlier he has been thinking, \"Touch me. Soft eyes. Soft soft soft hand. I am lonely here. O, touch me soon, now,\" so the reader must suppose that the author intends to place Nora within his web of associations. With this added context, \"barnacle goose becomes featherbed mountain\" acquires distinctly erotic overtones. The feathers of dead geese are used to stuff a featherbed, and Nora too gets into that soft lovely bed. \n All of these fanciful chains of association soften the brutally reductive vision of devouring a urinous offal from all dead. Summing them up, one might say that life reigns in the midst of death. And from this perspective, one can also note that the corpse on which Stephen is centering his speculations is not completely dead. The \"quiver of minnows,\" darting like little arrows and flashing gleams of silver light, quiver with some of the life of the penis they have been snacking on. And the man's leprous nosehole is \"snoring.\" In a strong anticipation of Finnegans Wake, this corpse may only be sleeping, and sleeping people merge with features of the landscape. Like Anna Livia \"moananoaning\" her \"seasilt saltsick\" way to the bay and HCE feeling his \"humptyhillhead\" in Howth and his \"tumptytumtoes\" at their \"knock out in the park,\" this unconscious man has metamorphosed into the Featherbed Mountain."

It is located a block and a half west of Capel Street, just around the corner from a courthouse on Green Street and not far from the Four Courts. The legal milieu had a powerful influence on the pub's clientele, conversations, and furnishings.",
    "expandedNote": " This grim little establishment adorned its walls with memorabilia celebrating insurrections, trials, and executions, a fact reflected in the episode's frequent references to law courts, hangings, police blotters, and heroic violence. Given the fervid spirit of Irish nationalism that prevails in the bar, it seems hugely ironic that it is located (as we learn late in the chapter) at \"8, 9 and 10 little Britain street.\"\n The proprietor of the pub never appears in Cyclops. It seems possible, even likely, that he is the gentleman to whom Joe Hynes refers just before suggesting a visit to Barney Kiernan's:\n — What about paying our respects to our friend? says Joe.\n — Who? says I. Sure, he's out in John of God's off his head, poor man.\n — Drinking his own stuff? says Joe.\n — Ay, says I. Whisky and water on the brain.\n — Come around to Barney Kiernan’s, says Joe. I want to see the citizen.\n — Barney mavourneen's be it, says I. \n The House of St. John of God was a facility for people with mental illness in Stillorgan, a southeastern suburb west of Kingstown. The implication is that the pub owner has entered the asylum to recover from the DTs, the fruit of \"drinking his own stuff.\"\n As of mid-2019 the building that housed the pub was for sale, and a rumor (perhaps fueled by wishful thinking) was circulating that a developer had proposed bringing the establishment back to life. Were that to happen, Barney Kiernan's would instantly join the short list of top sites for the world's Joyce tourists."

    "note": " Ulysses contains many references to \"barracks,\" beginning with Buck Mulligan's joking words on the first page. As the capital of a subjugated nation with a long history of rebellion, Dublin in 1904 was quite literally ringed with military barracks.",
    "expandedNote": " It is not clear why, in any realistic sense, Mulligan should bark the command, \"Back to barracks!\" Gifford suggests that the suds in his shaving bowl are somehow similar to soldiers who, having performed their morning parade, can be dismissed from formation. But these suds have not yet performed either of the tasks for which they were assembled: becoming transubstantiated and shaving Mulligan’s face. \n In a personal communication, Tony Jones suggests another possibility: \"It is a humorous slang phrase in Ireland for adjusting your underwear so that your genitals are back where they belong.\" Just as a man among male friends may change his position on a barstool and say, \"That's the boys back in the barracks!,\" Mulligan, who shortly afterward is seen \"gathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown,\" may be commenting to Stephen on the uncomfortable arrangement his boys have adopted. It seems strange that a man standing in a loose dressing gown could be experiencing such discomfort, and strange too that Buck would interrupt his priestly routine to comment on it, but this reading feels at least as plausible as Gifford's. \n In any case, the question of confining soldiers to their barracks, or not, would have been much on Dubliners' minds at this time, when troops were free to roam the streets at night,seeking sex and getting involved in brawls. British soldiers were a fixture on Dublin’s streets, and the city was encircled by barracks housing large numbers of troops. Joyce makes repeated mention of the sprawling \"Portobello barracks\" in the south central suburb of Rathmines, the home of the two soldiers who assault Stephen in Circe. It accommodated large cavalry units. Cyclops mentions the more centrally located \"Linenhall barracks,\" a three-acre complex of buildings erected in the 1720s and enlarged in the 1780s to promote the manufacture and trade of Irish linen. By 1904 that enterprise had been moribund for a century, and the buildings were sometimes used as barracks for British troops. \n In Hades Bloom thinks of how Rudy must have been conceived \"that morning in Raymond terrace she was at the window watching the two dogs at it by the wall of the cease to do evil. And the sergeant grinning up.\" \"Cease to do evil; learn to do well\" was the motto over the door of the Richmond Bridewell, a jail on the South Circular Road that was given to the War Department in the 1880s and 90s and expanded, becoming the Wellington Barracks. These barracks, since 1922 called the Griffith Barracks and devoted to other uses, lie across the South Circular Road from Raymond Terrace.\n There were many other such facilities. The Royal Barracks on Benburb Street, on the north bank of the Liffey west of the Four Courts, were the largest in the city. By 1735 they could house five battalions (about 5,000 soldiers), and even more capacity was added as time went on. The Richmond Barracks in Inchicore, on the western edge of the city, could house 1,600 men. The Beggars Bush Barracks were located on the southeastern edge of the city, the Aldborough House Barracks on the northeast. The Marlborough Barracks were in Glasnevin, on the northwest edge of the city. There was also a barracks near the Pigeon House on the South Wall. In addition to all these British soldiers, the Royal Irish Constabulary, whose constables wore military-style uniforms, had a large barracks near the Marlborough Barracks. They were run from Dublin Castle, the center of imperial power in the city, and they had a large depot and magazine in Phoenix Park, not far from the barracks. \n More army barracks were scattered throughout the country, many of them within easy reach of Dublin. Along the Military Road, which was built through the Wicklow Mountains in the years after the 1798 Rising in order to deny insurgents hiding places in the hills, five large barracks were constructed during the course of the 19th century. Athlone, in the western part of County Westmeath about 75 miles from the capital, had another large garrison."

    "note": " Not least of the bewildering ways in which Proteus plunges the reader into the waves of Stephen's thoughts, with little connection to the dry land of dialogue and action, is its refusal to translate his kaleidoscopic multilingualism into English. In addition to lots of French, some German and Latin, and smatterings of Scots, Irish, Swedish, Greek, and Spanish, the episode contains more than half a dozen phrases in Italian, a language which Joyce spoke fluently. Two of the utterances translated here come from works of literature and opera, and are discussed in other notes. The remaining ones are conversational.",
    "expandedNote": " Stephen Dedalus has studied Italian at university, and in Wandering Rocks he will run across his maestro or teacher, Almidano Artifoni, and hold a conversation with him in Italian. The first paragraph of Proteus mentions another maestro, recalling Dante's honorific phrase for Aristotle in the Inferno: \"maestro di color che sanno,\" \"the master of those who know.\"\n Stephen's next use of Italian comes as he decides to end the experiment of closing his eyes and making the world disappear. \"Basta!\" means \"Enough!\"\n The language irrupts into the text again when Stephen imagines his uncle Richie Goulding singing, humming, and whistling parts of Verdi's Il Trovatore. \"All'erta!\" means \"On the alert!\" or \"On guard!\" It is the basso Ferrando's \"aria di sortita\" (the song with which a given character enters), and he is telling the troops under his command to keep a careful watch at night. \n Later, as Stephen remembers trailing behind a \"fubsy widow\" hoping that she will lift her wet skirts to show some calf he thinks sardonically, \"O, si, certo! Sell your soul for that, do.\" The Italian could be rendered, \"O yeah, sure!\" or, in an even more American idiom, \"Yeah, right!\"\n In the same vein, he thinks later of \"The virgin at Hodges Figgis' window\" that he eyed on Monday: \"Bet she wears those curse of God stays suspenders and yellow stockings, darned with lumpy wool. Talk about apple dumplings, piuttosto. Where are your wits?\" The Italian word means \"rather\" or \"quite,\" serving here as an intensifier.\n In the midst of thinking of the sexual licentiousness of Paris, Stephen uses an Italian word to personify the men comically jumping from bed to bed: \"Belluomo rises from the bed of his wife's lover's wife.\" The word means, literally, \"beautiful man,\" and perhaps that is a better translation than \"handsome man,\" given what the paragraph goes on to say about \"curled conquistadores\" (Spanish for \"conquerors\"). \n Stephen thinks of Thomas Aquinas as \"frate porcospino\" or Brother Porcupine, the porcupine monk—because, Gifford infers, \"Aquinas's argument is prickly and difficult to attack.\"\n And finally, near the end of the episode, he thinks \"Già,\" or \"Already.\" Gifford notes, \"As Stephen uses the word here, \"Già . . . Già,\" it is an expression of impatience: 'Let's go . . . Let's go.'\""

    "note": " Again looking back on his own tender childhood through the lens of the schoolboys, Stephen imagines himself \"among them\" on the hockey field, pathetically unable: \"You mean that knockneed mother's darling who seems to be slightly crawsick?\" But he also looks forward in life to the military contests for which field games prepare boys, as surely as medieval jousts did.",
    "expandedNote": " The clashing sticks of the hockey game and the shouts of the boys become \"Jousts, slush and uproar of battles, the frozen deathspew of the slain,\na shout of spearspikes baited with men's bloodied guts.\" Reading backward, we can see other reasons to view the hockey game as a battle: \"the scrappy\nfield where sharp voices were in strife,\" the unfortunate boy whose name is \"Sargent.\" \n Clearly, many games (field hockey, ice hockey, hurling, rugby, soccer, American and Gaelic football, lacrosse, chess) are sublimated and stylized substitutes for battle. In Stephen Hero an earlier avatar of Stephen had criticized field sports as \"mimic warfare\" (34), picking up on the phrase \"mimic hunt\" that he had used for them in an early essay vesion of the novel. But when he was writing Nestor in 1917 Joyce had one specific struggle to think about: the Great War which had been chewing Europe's youth into bloody bits since 1914. As he listens to his students playing, and helps maintain order on the field for an old commander who does not listen to what people are saying, Stephen finds himself implicated in militarism, just as teaching ancient Roman history implicated him in imperialism.\n In an important 1986 article, \"Nestor and the Nightmare: The Presence of the Great War in Ulysses\" (Twentieth Century Literature 32.2), Robert E. Spoo observed that Stephen's statement slightly later in the chapter that history is \"a nightmare\" uses an image that was applied to World War I by Henry James, W. B. Yeats, D. H. Lawrence, and others. Spoo argues that not only the hockey game but the entire episode dwells on questions of war. Pyrrhus' futile battle becomes all battles: \"Any general to any officers.\" The physically decrepit but boisterously jingoistic Mr. Deasy becomes an antiquated Homeric general, at a time in European history when countless voices were complaining about the confident \"old men\" who were sending millions of young men off to die horrible deaths. Stephen's skeptical response to Deasy's talk of generosity and justice—\"I fear those big words . . . that make us so unhappy\"—resembles the criticism of \"big words\" like glory, honor, courage, and power by war writers like Wilfred Owen, Ernest Hemingway, and Robert Graves. \n Spoo penetratingly observes that \"the boys Stephen teaches in 1904—most of them from well-to-do families with English or Scottish names like Cochrane, Talbot, and Armstrong—will be officer material in ten years. They were being killed as Joyce created their fictive counterparts.\" He also notes that Leopold Bloom is, in the words of the narrator of Eumaeus, \"only too conscious of the casualties invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity\"; bellicose rhetoric brings \"misery and suffering\" to \"fine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word.\" \n In the symbolic economy of the book, this makes Bloom a considerably better father figure than Deasy, who counts on Stephen to maintain order on a battlefield of which he himself knows nothing and cares little. Stephen's role in the school sports is perhaps analogous to the British officers in WWI who were (personal communication from Don Gifford) stationed behind the front lines and charged with the task of murdering any men who disobeyed orders by retreating from the carnage. At the end of his math tutorial with Sargent, he tells the boy, \"You had better get your stick and go out to the others.\" The pathetic boy answers, \"Yes, sir\" and, when his name is called from the playing field, Stephen adds, \"Run on . . . Mr Deasy is calling you.\""

    "note": " When Stephen thinks, \"I just simply stood pale, silent, bayed about,\" he may or may not be recalling some earlier physical experience with a dog. But he is certainly repeating one of Joyce's early images of himself as a deer hunted by dogs.",
    "expandedNote": " In the last chapter of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man Stephen famously announces to his friend Cranly \"the only arms I allow myself to use—silence, exile, and cunning.\" In the embryonic germ of the novel—the similarly titled essay/story \"A Portrait of the Artist,\" written in 1904—Joyce used different metaphorical language to describe the blood sport that he saw himself engaged in during his university years. Instead of the athletic contests (hockey, hurling, rugby, football) that sublimate violence for many young men, he would think of himself as a solitary buck pursued by a pack of hounds.\n He wrote of the young artist: \"About this period the enigma of a manner was put up to all comers to protect the crisis. He was quick enough now to see that he must disentangle his affairs in secrecy and reserve had ever been a light penance. His reluctance to debate scandal, to seem curious of others, aided him in his real indictment and was not without a satisfactory flavour of the heroic. It was part of that ineradicable egoism of which he was afterward redeemer that he imagined converging to him the deeds and thoughts of the microcosm. Is the mind of boyhood medieval that it is so divining of intrigue? Field sports (or their correspondents in the world of mentality) are perhaps the most effective cure, but for this fantastic idealist, eluding the grunting booted apparition with a bound, the mimic hunt was no less ludicrous than unequal in a ground chosen to his disadvantage. But behind the rapidly indurating shield the sensitive answered: Let the pack of enmities come tumbling and sniffing to the highlands after their game. There was his ground and he flung them disdain from flashing antlers\" (Poems and Shorter Writings, ed. Richard Ellmann, A. Walton Litz, and John Whittier Ferguson [London, 1991], p. 211, italics added). \n Later in 1904 Joyce wrote a poem called \"The Holy Office\" in which he excoriated contemporary Irish writers who \"dream their dreamy dreams,\" leaving Joyce, the truth-teller, to \"carry off their filthy streams.\" Against the pack mentality of the Irish Revival he presented himself again as a solitary pursuer of truth: \n Where they have crouched and crawled and prayed \n I stand, the self-doomed, unafraid,\n Unfellowed, friendless and alone,\n Indifferent as the herring-bone,\n Firm as the mountain ridges where\n I flash my antlers on the air.\n Thornton and Gifford both suggest that the deer-dog image in Proteus recalls the myth of Actaeon, and Gifford sees fit to observe that \"The deer or roebuck is also a traditional symbol of the hidden secret of the self. In Celtic mythology its epithet is 'Hide the Secret.'\" It is unclear what these other associations might have to do with Stephen's situation, though Gifford does offer one possible connection to the \"lapwing\" in Scylla and Charybdis."

    "note": " Imagining the umbilical cords of generations of humans (\"strandentwining cable of all flesh\") reaching back to Eden, Stephen supposes that this is \"why mystic monks\" gaze in their navels: the umbilicus leads back to godhead. He conflates this yogic omphaloskepsis with the biblical passage in which the serpent convinces Eve that she will become godlike if she eats the forbidden fruit: \"Will you be as gods?\"",
    "expandedNote": " In Genesis 3:4-5 the subtle serpent asks the woman about God's command not to eat the fruit of one tree and says, \"Ye shall not surely die: For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.\" \n In book 9 of Paradise Lost, John Milton elaborately dramatized this simple encounter. Satan enters the body of the serpent, winds his sinuous way to the place where Eve is gardening, and addresses her flatteringly as \"A goddess among gods, adored and served / By angels numberless, thy daily train\" (547-48). Astonished to hear a mere animal speaking, she asks the snake how he has come by his eloquence, and he says that once, like other beasts, he had \"abject thoughts and low\" (572), but the fruit of a certain tree brought about \"Strange alteration in me,\" endowing him with reason, speech, and \"speculations high\" (599-602). He leads her to the tree, and overcomes her reluctance by arguing that God gave his command \"to keep ye low and ignorant, / His worshippers; he knows that in the day / Ye eat thereof . . . ye shall be as gods, / Knowing both good and evil as they know. / That ye should be as gods, since I as man, / Internal man, is but proportion meet, / I of brute human, ye of human gods\" (704-12).\n The impulse to self-divinization, largely unencumbered by Christian taboos of obedience, humility, and veneration, enters the novel through several channels, at least one of them Christian: the revivalist preaching of John Alexander Dowie."

    "note": " In her letter to her father in Calypso, Milly reports that \"all the beef to the heels were in\" Mullingar—a confusing phrase, since fair day was the occasion for driving cattle to town, but she seems to be referring to people. The expression is used widely in rural Ireland for well-fed cattle; \"Beef to the heels like a Mullingar heifer\" suggests livestock richly endowed with flesh right down to the ground. But by association it also frequently refers to well-off people, particularly women who look like they haven't missed many meals. An odd assortment of connotations results: appreciation of wealth (Milly's usage), contempt for sexual unattractiveness (Bloom's in Lestrygonians), desire for fullbodied womanhood (Bannon's in Oxen of the Sun).",
    "expandedNote": " In Lestrygonians Bloom recalls Milly's letter while gazing at a woman's stockinged calves on Grafton Street: \"Thick feet that woman has in the white stockings. Hope the rain mucks them up on her. Countrybred chawbacon. All the beef to the heels were in. Always gives a woman clumsy feet. Molly looks out of plumb.\" In Nausicaa, Gerty's attractively presented legs make him think back to women's calves that he has perused earlier in the day, including the pair on Grafton Street: \"Transparent stockings, stretched to breaking point. Not like that frump today. A. E. Rumpled stockings. Or the one in Grafton street. White. Wow! Beef to the heel.\" \n In Oxen of the Sun, the phrase returns full circle to Milly, when Bannon (whom Milly has mentioned in her letter) shows up at the hospital with Mulligan and \"would tell him of a skittish heifer, big of her age and beef to the heel.\" Here, the phrase seems to suggest that Milly is well filled out for her tender age—a toothsome morsel. Thornton reports that Fritz \"Senn suggests, I think correctly, that Milly has heard the phrase from her boy friend.\" \n The saying, then, not only crosses a species barrier but also encompasses a sea of economic and sexual ambivalence. A 2013 Welsh exhibition of new paintings by Gordon Dalton titled \"Beef to the heel like a Mullingar heifer\" offers the following catalogue commentary on its title: \"Irish derogatory slang, but also means high quality. Gordon Dalton’s work, like a backhanded compliment, has the same anxious contradictions\" (www.artswales.org.uk)."

  "140040beforeborn": {
    "note": " New Style. \"Before born bliss babe had. Within womb won he worship...So stood they there both awhile in wanhope sorrowing one with other\": these six paragraphs announce a clear departure from what has gone before. In his letter to Frank Budgen Joyce said that the initial Latinate prose of Oxen would be followed by \"earliest English alliterative and monosyllabic Anglo-Saxon.\" The new section narrating Bloom's arrival at the Holles Street maternity hospital and his conversation at the door with nurse Callan—most of the section, anyway—is indeed marked by alliteration, old Germanic words, and far more straightforward syntax. But the neatness of this characterization is complicated by a brief intrusion of something like the earlier style, and also by the competing influences of two different literary inspirations from the 10th century, one of them written in verse rather than prose.",
    "expandedNote": " Critical discussions and annotations of this chapter seldom remark on the fact that insistent alliteration, while highly characteristic of the poetry of the Anglo-Saxon era, was not usually a feature of its prose. In lieu of rhymes or metrical feet, poets writing in Old English used alliteration to organize their verse lines. No matter how long or short a line (no set number of syllables was prescribed), several words (typically three or four) with the same initial consonant sounds (or vowels—any vowels) would be deployed over the course of the line (usually on both sides of a midline caesura). The alliterative syllables received accentual stress, creating what is often called a strong-stress or accentual meter. The effect can be gauged in the opening lines of The Wanderer, a magnificent long lyric poem recorded in a 10th century manuscript:\n Oft him anhaga are gebideð,\n [Always the solitary one awaits kindness,]\n metudes miltse, þeah þe he mod cearig\n [mercy of the Creator, even though he, heart-troubled,]\n geond lagu lade longe sceolde\n [through the sea-ways for a long time must]\n hreran mid hondum hrim cealde sæ \n [stir with his hands the ice-cold sea,]\n wadan wræc lastas. Wyrd bið ful aræd!\n [tread the paths of exile. Fate is fully determined!]\n I quote these lines because many readers have heard The Wanderer as a model for Joyce's writing in this section, despite his plan to imitate the history of English prose. The first two sentences do sound like lines of Old English verse: \"Before born bliss babe had. Within womb won he worship.\" But after this point the rigid march of consonants disappears—the rest of the first paragraph uses no alliteration, and later paragraphs use it sparingly, about once a sentence on average. The echoes of The Wanderer, if such they are, are more thematic than prosodic. Like the exiled seafarer in the poem, Bloom \"on earth wandering far has fared.\" He once lived near the hospital \"with dear wife and lovesome daughter that then over land and seafloor nine years had long outwandered.\" As Gifford notes, the seafarer also keeps his thoughts and concerns to himself, and this quality distinguishes Bloom throughout Oxen of the Sun. \n Joyce's complicated use of a poem in a chapter about prose—two of his sentences sound like Old English verse without imitating the poem's contents, while five other paragraphs imitate the content without sounding like verse—creates difficulties for commentators looking to neatly divide the chapter's different styles. The trouble is compounded because those five paragraphs have another clearly identifiable inspiration: the Homilies of an Anglo-Saxon abbot called Ælfric of Eynsham or Ælfric the Grammarian. Rather than treat all six paragraphs as one section, Gifford identifies Ælfric as the inspiration for the first paragraph (which does not resemble his writing in the least), and The Wanderer as a model for the last five paragraphs (which do sound like Ælfric). Both Declan Kiberd and Jeri Johnson repeat these dubious attributions without further comment. \n Ælfric composed prose works on religious topics, sometimes using alliteration to echo, faintly, the rhythmic effects of Old English verse. Joyce encountered his writing in one of two anthologies of English prose that he mined for the language of Oxen, George Saintsbury's A History of English Prose Rhythm (1912). In The Sources and Structures of James Joyce's Oxen(1983), Robert Janusko identifies phrases from Ælfric's Homilies that Joyce copied into his notesheets from Saintsbury's anthology and that made their way into the chapter (94). He also quotes, in modern translation, an excerpt from the life of St. Cuthbert that particularly caught Joyce's attention: \n The aforesaid holy man was wonted that he would go at night to the sea, and stand on the salt brim up to his swire [neck] singing his beads. Then on a certain night waited another monk his faring; and with slack stalking his footswathes followed till that they both to sea came. Then did Cuthbert as his wont was; sang his beads in the sea-like ooze, standing up to the swire, and sithence his knees on the chesil bowed, with out stretched handbreadths to the heavenly firmament. Lo! then came twey seals from the sea-ground, and they with their flix his feet dried, andwith their breath his limbs warmed, and sithence his beckonings with blessing bade, lying at his feet on the fallow chesil.\n Janusko observes that Cuthbert's nightly visits to the sea can he heard in Joyce's second and fifth paragraphs: Bloom arrives at the hospital \"at night's oncoming,\" and he \"over land and seafloor nine year had long outwandered.\" Joyce's second paragraph echoes the other monk waiting for Cuthbert's \"faring\": \"Some man that wayfaring was stood by housedoor...that man that on earth wandering far had fared.\" Ælfric's word for neck, \"swire,\" shows up in the fourth paragraph when nurse Callan rises and opens the door for Bloom \"with swire ywimpled.\" The \"twey seals\" reappear in the third paragraph when nurses Callan and Quigley are called \"Watchers twey.\" The fact that the seals dried Cuthbert and \"his limbs warmed\" may also, Janusko suggests, sound in the sixth paragraph in nurse Callan's report that Doctor O'Hare received \"sick men's oil to his limbs\" (59). These convincing parallels occur in all five paragraphs, and the careful reader will note how much Ælfric's use of alliteration (preserved in the modern translation) resembles Joyce's, popping up from time to time rather than establishing a rigid pattern.\n Janusko discovered one more borrowing that Joyce did not copy onto his notesheets. In the New Testament story of the centurion Ælfric writes, \"Soothly he manifested mickle humility in this, that he said, 'Lord, not am I worthy that thou infare under my thatch.'\" This gives rise to a lewdly suggestive detail in Joyce's fourth paragraph, when Callan urges Bloom to come inside: \"Christ's rood made she on breastbone and him drew that he would rathe infare under her thatch.\" Janusko notes that \"Literally, to infare under a thatch means the same in both sentences: to enter a building. The statement of the centurion, however, as Joyce would well have known, is the source for the 'Domine non sum dignus' prayer in the Mass said by communicants before receiving the host: 'Lord I am not worthy that you should come under my roof. Speak but the word and my soul shall be healed'\" (59-60). In Oxen, the phrase suggests that Callan is inviting Bloom into her vagina. \"Depending on one's point of view,\" Janusko observes, Joyce is either blasphemously using a prayer from the Mass to describe an obscene act, or to suggest the sacramental nature of copulation, that is, a visible and outward sign of a spiritual union\" (60).\n Beyond the many clear echoes of Ælfric, Joyce deployed a wealth of archaic Germanic words to enforce the feeling of a distant Anglo-Saxon past. The actions described in his last five paragraphs—Bloom comes to the hospital, led by concern for Mrs. Purefoy; two nurses walk the halls of the hospital, taking good care of the expectant mothers; nurse Callan opens the door to Bloom, sees rain and lightning, crosses herself, and urges him to come in; Bloom stands inside the entrance holding his hat and apologizes for having once failed to recognize her quickly enough in the street; she blushes at his friendliness and expresses concern at his mourning clothes; he asks about a doctor who used to be at the hospital and learns that he died two and a half years ago—all these events are recounted in recognizably English syntax, but colored by the filter of ancient words:\n \"stark ruth\" (strong pity or compassion) \n \"to thole and bring forth bairns\" (wait patiently, children)\n \"twey\" (two)\n \"Truest bedthanes\" (attendants)\n \"wariest ward\" (care or protection) \n \"eft\" (again)\n \"swire ywimpled\" (neck covered with a wimple)\n \"levin leaping lightens in eyeblink\" (lightning)\n \"westward welkin\" (sky) \n \"Full she dread\" (dreaded) \n \"fordo with water\" (kill) \n \"he would rathe infare\" (quickly enter)\n \"Christ's rood\" (cross)\n \"her will wotting worthful\" (knowing)\n \"Loth to irk\" (reluctant) \n \"On her stow\" (place) \n \"townhithe\" (port town or town port)\n \"his weeds swart\" (black clothing)\n \"grameful sigh\" (sorrowful)\n \"algate\" (always)\n \"shriven\" (confessed and absolved)\n \"holy housel\" (the Eucharist)\n \"the nun\" (term of respect for a woman, instead of \"nurse,\" \n which as Gifford observes comes from Old French) \n \"bellycrab\" (i.e., stomach cancer, cancer being Latin)\n \"Childermas\" (Holy Innocents Day, December 28, \n commemorating Herod's slaughter of the infants)\n \"wanhope\" (despair)\n Several of the words come from Ælfric: \"swire,\" \"infare,\" and \"twey\" appear above, and Janusko's list of the phrases that Joyce copied into his notesheets from Saintsbury's anthology shows that \"stow\" and \"townhithe\" were taken from Ethelbald's grant to the Bishop of Worcester (94). But it seems likely that Joyce was reading more broadly in Old English literature. Other literary sources will probably eventually be identified.\n In addition to the highly problematic mixture of verse and prose echoes, this passage contains another anomaly that commentators have either failed to notice or been content to ignore: the prose of the first paragraph threatens to devolve from Anglo-Saxon back into something like the Latinate style of earlier paragraphs. After the strikingly Germanic beginning, a short sentence is contaminated by the Latinate word \"commodiously,\" and then a very long sentence brims over with such words: \"A couch by midwives attended with wholesome food reposeful, cleanest swaddles as though forthbringing were now done and by wise foresight set: but to this no less of what drugs there is need and surgical implements which are pertaining to her case not omitting aspect of all very distracting spectacles in various latitudes by our terrestrial orb offered together with images, divine and human, the cogitation of which by sejunct females is to tumescence conducive or eases issue in the high sunbright wellbuilt fair home of mothers when, ostensibly far gone and reproductitive, it is come by her thereto to lie in, her term up.\" \n This sentence is much too long for the Anglo-Saxon style. It contains no alliteration, unless one seeks it over much-too-long distances (food, forthbringing, foresight). Monosyllabic Germanic words increasingly give way to polysyllabic Latinate equivalents that toward the end sound almost as obscurely remote as the vocabulary of the earlier paragraphs: \"sejunct females,\" \"to tumescence conducive,\" \"reproductitive.\" And the thudding simplicity of the paragraph's Anglo-Saxon beginning gives way to a meandering syntactic florescence that is finally choked off in Germanic directness: \"it is come by her thereto to lie in, her term up.\"\n Nothing in Joyce's letters betrays an intention to occasionally regress from new styles to ones characterized as historically older. But the messiness is all too characteristic of Oxen. Chronological retrogression happens more than once in its series of styles, and many of the phrases borrowed from Saintsbury and other sources show up in places remote from the historical eras in which they were written. Joyce could have maintained a tidier order had he wished to, so his refusal to slot styles into neat imitative compartments begs explanation. Perhaps he resumed an earlier style here because he was describing the maternity hospital, not Bloom. Perhaps he thought that periodization is artificial—old styles of writing persisting after historians deem a new era to have begun, and new ones popping up before their time. Perhaps he wanted to put his own stamp on literary history, generating styles as much from personal whim as from scholarly study. These hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, but the wild linguistic energy of Oxen's narrative—fully in keeping with the drunken young men's wild conversation—may advocate especially for the third view."

The former runs south for a couple of blocks from the North Circular Road, going past the Mater Misericordiae hospital and Eccles. Angling left, it then becomes Berkeley Street, which runs southeast for half a dozen blocks until, crossing Blessington Street, it becomes Mountjoy Street. In Calypso \"Quick warm sunlight came running from Berkeley road\" to greet Bloom as he leaves Dorset Street and approaches his home. In Hades, a couple of hours later, the funeral carriage in which he is riding \"turned into Berkeley Street\" after proceeding up Blessington.",
    "expandedNote": " The detail in Calypso about sunlight running from Berkeley Road to meet Bloom requires some explaining, since he is walking toward the road in a generally westerly direction, away from the sun rising in the east. Gifford offers a cogent explication: \"As the cloud moves eastward on the prevailing westerly wind, sunlight moves along Eccles Street toward Bloom.\" The effect is similar to one at the beginning of Telemachus, where the Wicklow mountains are described as \"awaking\" because the sun rising in the east first illuminates their tops and then works down their flanks.\n In Hades the funeral cortège travels north by northwest from Sandymount to Glasnevin. After crossing the river and moving up O'Connell Street to the Rotunda at Rutland (now Parnell) Square, it climbs \"more slowly the hill of Rutland square\" in a slightly more westerly direction, and, heading still more to the west, rolls \"swiftly along Blessington Street.\" Then it turns right into Berkeley Street, where it encounters a lot of activity: \"a streetorgan near the Basin sent over and after them a rollicking rattling song of the halls. . . . The Mater Misericordiae. Eccles street. My house down there. Big place. . . . A divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows, lowing, slouching by on padded hoofs, whisking their tails slowly on their clotted bony croups. Outside them and through them ran raddled sheep bleating their fear. . . . — Huuuh! the drover's voice cried, his switch sounding on their flanks. / Huuuh! out of that! . . . The carriage moved on through the drove.\"\n The photograph reproduced here shows a scene in Berkeley Street that appears quite congested enough without the involvement of livestock. Bloom's idea of taking live animals out of the mix by running \"a tramline from the parkgate to the quays\" seems quite sensible."

Joyce's fiction repeatedly features men searching for affordable meals, or trying to get the most for their prix fixe. In Two Gallants Lenehan has a miserable meal of \"a plate of peas\" after determining that it will cost \"Three halfpence.\" In Lestrygonians Bloom sees men \"Perched on high stools by the bar, hats shoved back, at the tables calling for more bread no charge, swilling, wolfing gobfuls of sloppy food.\" In Eumaeus the \"starving\" Corley has heard that \"you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over in Winetavern street . . . for a bob,\" or 12d."

    "note": " Passing by \"the frowning face\" of a Salvation Army establishment in Lombard Street, Bloom recalls the rudiments of Hebrew that he learned from his father to decipher the significance of its name: \"Bethel. El, yes: house of: Aleph, Beth.\" As Bloom observes, \"Beth\" is both the second letter of the Hebrew alphabet (Aleph, Beth, Gimel, Daleth) and a word meaning house or (as he thinks) \"house of.\" Bloom seems to recognize the meaning of \"El\"—God—but he does not articulate it.",
    "expandedNote": " The ancient Israelite city of Bethel, about twelve miles north of Jerusalem on the border of the tribes of Benjamin and Ephraim, is mentioned frequently in the Hebrew Bible. It was the site of Jacob's dream of a ladder reaching from earth to heaven (Genesis 28:12), and later the place where the ark of the covenant was kept (Judges 20:27), so it could be seen quite literally as the house of God. If Bloom is thinking of the name's religious significance, the \"frowning face\" of the Salvation Army building may insinuate some comment on his, or Joyce's, view of the deity.\n A walking map published online by the Dublin Tourism authority (www.visitdublin.com/iwalks) notes that the Bethel Salvation Army Hostel once resided at 19-20 Lombard Street, near Lombard's intersection with \"Townsend\" Street, which Bloom has just crossed. It has been replaced by a more modern building, however."

Out here in the dark with a man I don't know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a black panther.\" Stephen complains to Buck Mulligan about Haines frightening him during the night with his nightmare, and in Proteus he thinks again of when \"he woke me up.\" In real life Joyce was wakened by something far worse than mere apprehension that the Englishman might fire his gun.",
    "expandedNote": " Richard Ellmann narrates the actual events. Joyce was living at the tower, largely at Gogarty’s expense and \"sufferance\" (the word used by Stanislaus Joyce in his diary). Relations were strained, but Gogarty did not want to endanger his bohemian reputation, and his chance of appearing in a good light in Joyce's fiction, by putting Joyce out. Trench, whom Gogarty knew from Oxford and who had become a fervent follower of the Irish Revival, was living with them in the tower. On the night of September 14, 1904 Trench woke up screaming about a black panther that was about to spring on him, fired his revolver at the fireplace beside which Joyce was sleeping, and then went back to sleep. His nightmare returned and he screamed once more and reached for his revolver, but Gogarty had taken it. Gogarty said, “Leave him to me,” and shot some pots and pans over Joyce’s bed, which crashed down on him. \"The terrified Joyce considered this fusillade his dismissal\" (175). He got up, dressed, left the tower, and walked all the way to Dublin. The next day, he wrote a note to a friend asking him to go to the tower and pack up his trunk. Ellmann comments: “Perhaps all grand gestures end with someone else packing the trunk.” \n This event prompted Joyce to decide finally to leave Ireland, for the second time and for good. He did so with Nora Barnacle, whom he had met in June of the same year. They boarded a ship for France in October. (Trench committed suicide on June 1, 1909, by blowing out his brains. Ellmann speculates that it was \"perhaps with the very weapon with which he and Gogarty had so nearly blown out Joyce's.\") \n In fictionally presenting these decisive events, Joyce made many changes. He eliminated the terror of having a firearm discharged in his direction in the confines of a small dark stone room. Haines does not fire his gun, and Stephen merely asks nervously the next morning, \"Where is his guncase?\" Gogarty’s role in the terrorizing disappears as well. Stephen’s response thus becomes softer than Joyce’s was. Sympathizing with Haines when Mulligan promises to \"give him a ragging,\" he decides that he can remain in the tower. And instead of a dramatic break with Mulligan, he merely deepens his feeling that a break is imminent, thinking that he cannot come back to the tower on the next night. In Proteus, imagining Haines as an upper-class Britisher on safari and Mulligan as his trusty hound/tourguide, he thinks, \"I will not sleep there when this night comes. A shut door of a silent tower, entombing their blind bodies, the panthersahib and his pointer.\" (His next thought is, \"Call: no answer.\" Probably he is imagining showing up at the tower, yelling up at the stone slits to announce his arrival, and being rebuffed.)\n Although Stephen does take his leave of Bloom and the rest of us much as Joyce took his leave of Gogarty—by walking off into the darkness at the end of Ithaca—the novel does not encourage us to think that his split from Mulligan exercises any decisive significance in his life. Instead, by setting the events in the tower on June 16, 1904, the date of his first outing with Nora Barnacle, Joyce manages to make the story more about love than alienation."

    "note": " As Stephen contemplates the gypsy couple on the sands in Proteus, he imagines the woman offering herself to men in the street while her pimp works two others in a bar: \"Her fancyman is treating two Royal Dublins in O'Loughlin's of Blackpitts.\" Stephen is thinking of a time that he spent walking through this bleak part of town in the Liberties: \"Fumbally's lane that night: the tanyard smells.\" In Aeolus he makes this neighborhood the fictional residence, not of the gypsy couple, but of the two women that he spotted earlier on the beach, who now star in his Parable of the Plums.",
    "expandedNote": " Blackpitts is a short street just west of Clanbrassil Street on the south side of Dublin. Fumbally Lane runs east for a couple of blocks from the north end of Blackpitts, whose name is variously said to derive from burial pits used during plague years (the \"Black Death\"), or from black vats used by tanners starting in the 18th century. In 1904 this working-class neighborhood was the site not only of tanneries, but also of piggeries (pig pens) and illegal cockfighting venues. Gifford identifies one particular tannery as the source of \"the tanyard smells\" that Stephen remembers: \"Kelly, Dunne & Co., tanners, fellmongers, and woolmerchants, 26-27 New Row South, just around the corner from Fumbally's Lane.\" He speculates that \"O'Loughlin's\" is a \"shebeen\" or unlicensed pub. \n When Stephen locates his two fictional vestals in this area, saying that they \"have lived fifty and fiftythree years in Fumbally's lane,\" Professor MacHugh asks, \"Where is that?\" Stephen replies, \"Off Blackpitts.\" The thoughts of squalid sexuality that he entertained about the gypsies continue to play in his mind as he composes this scene: \"Damp night reeking of hungry dough. Against the wall. Face glistening tallow under her fustian shawl. Frantic hearts. Akasic records. Quicker, darlint!\" The conjunction of the two pairs of walkers in the artist's mind may have something to do with the genesis of his heavily sexualized story, in which two aged virgins spit seeds off the top of a phallic tower.\n § Stephen may know this area because Richie and Sara Goulding lived nearby, before moving to their present house in Strasburg Terrace, Irishtown. Gabler's 1984 edition of the novel includes, in Ithaca, a recollection of visiting his beloved \"aunt Sara, wife of Richie (Richard) Goulding, in the kitchen of their lodgings at 62 Clanbrassil street.\""

  "040064bleibtreustrasse": {
    "note": " \"Bleibtreustrasse\" is an actual street in the Charlottenburg district of Berlin, named after the painter Georg Bleibtreu in 1897. But its English equivalent would be something like \"Stay True Street,\" or \"Remain Faithful Road.\" When Bloom thinks in the next moment, \"Nothing doing. Still an idea behind it,\" he is referring to the Agendath Netaim proposal, and the idea is Zionism. But Bleibtreustrasse implies a second kind of idea.",
    "expandedNote": " The ad for the agricultural investment promises \"Your name entered for life as owner in the book of the union\"—quasi-legal language for investment in a real estate partnership, but also a fair description of a successful marriage. It seems possible that Joyce may also be making teasing references to Bloom's domestic situation with the numbers that he attaches to the street. The postal zone code, \"15,\" is Milly's age as of yesterday. The address on Bleibtreustrasse, \"34,\" does not line up with Molly's age quite so neatly. She is 33 on June 16, and will not be 34 until September 8. However, given the deep uncertainty that Molly expresses about her own age in Penelope—\"the 4 years more I have of life up to 35 no Im what am I at all Ill be 33 in September will I\"—perhaps some kind of allusion to her age can be heard in the number. \n Collectively, these details impart a symbolic function to the Agendath Netaim advertisement. The allure of participating in the Jews' return to their spiritual homeland bleeds over into Bloom's desire to maintain the home that he has made with Molly and Milly, a domestic stability that is threatened by Molly's adultery and Bloom's epistolary infidelity. Similar symbolic overtones will attach to the two songs that Molly plans to sing on her concert tour—Là ci darem and Love's Old Sweet Song—and to the story that Bloom reads from Titbits."

    "expandedNote": " Whitmonday is the day after Whitsunday, which falls on the seventh Sunday after Easter. Gifford notes that it is a bank holiday in Ireland, which suggests that Bloom may have been enjoying himself at home at the end of a three-day weekend when the incident occurred. \n Many people would remember a bee having stung them three weeks earlier, but not many (unless they were severely allergic) would run to the nearby hospital to be treated by a doctor. Bloom's babyish alarm confirms what Molly thinks about him in Penelope: \"if his nose bleeds youd think it was O tragic.\" It is the subject of hilarious parody in Oxen of the Sun: \"the traveller Leopold came there to be healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice.\" (One can make such a chrism for oneself, at home, with baking soda and water.)\n In addition to earning him the name of wimp, Bloom's reaction to the incident betrays a lack of entomological curiosity. Bees sting, but the bluebottle does not. Only slightly larger than a housefly, it possesses very similar anatomy and behavior."

Few elements of the novel engage as resonantly with Joyce's earlier fiction.",
    "expandedNote": " The stories of Dubliners show great sympathy for the constrained circumstances of Irish women, and \"The Boarding House\" contributes to this portrait gallery by beginning with the backstory of Mrs. Mooney, a butcher's daughter who married her father's foreman, and, soon after the old man's death, found her husband to be an abusive alcoholic. She separated from him, cut him off without a penny, sold the shop, and set up a boarding house. These circumstances help to explain, but hardly counterbalance in pathos, what she does to one of her boarders. \n Mrs. Mooney is an intimidating woman known to her lodgers as \"The Madam\"—a label that conveys her unquestioned authority but also suggests that her house somehow resembles a brothel. In this analogy the role of whore is played by her flirtatious nineteen-year-old daughter, who has the eyes of \"a little perverse madonna.\" Mrs. Mooney gives Polly \"the run of the young men\" in the house, but she can see that \"none of them meant business\"—until, one day, one bites the hook. Once the daughter's honor has been securely compromised the mother intervenes. Ominously, the reader learns that \"She dealt with moral problems as a cleaver deals with meat: and in this case she had made up her mind.\" \n Mrs. Mooney first interrogates Polly, who has maintained a cunning but unspoken awareness of her mother's cunning but unspoken awareness of what is going on. Her suspicions confirmed, she then reviews her moral options and decides that outrage is justified: \"She had allowed him to live beneath her roof, assuming he was a man of honour, and he had simply abused her hospitality.\" He is 34 or 35 years old, \"so that youth could not be pleaded as his excuse; nor could ignorance be his excuse since he was a man who had seen something of the world. He had simply taken advantage of Polly's youth and inexperience: that was evident.\" \n The outrage is entirely false: Doran has paid good coin for his \"hospitality,\" Mrs. Mooney could easily have prevented the liaison, and Polly has acted with as much savvy as her supposed seducer. (Indeed, she has reeled him in like a fish.) But Mrs. Mooney does not intend to allow her lodger the leisure to ponder such contradictions. Only one thing matters: \"What reparation would he make? / There must be reparation made in such cases. It is all very well for the man: he can go his ways as if nothing had happened, having had his moment of pleasure, but the girl has to bear the brunt. Some mothers would be content to patch up such an affair for a sum of money; she had known cases of it. But she would not do so. For her only one reparation could make up for the loss of her daughter's honour: marriage.\" Mrs. Mooney wants someone to take her daughter off her hands, and Mr. Doran, who appears to have some money set aside, seems a good catch. The narrative notes, twice, that she \"felt sure she would win.\" \n Doran seems more sensitive to social opinion than some of the other lodgers, and he has been \"employed for thirteen years in a great Catholic wine-merchant's office\"; the shame of a scandal could cost him that job. Other forces are arrayed against him. \"Reparation\" is a Catholic term for the expiation of sin, one invoked by the censorious priest to whom the young man has confessed his transgression. There is also the fear of physical violence: Polly's brother Jack is a foul-mouthed thug known to be good with his fists. Doran remembers that once, when one of the lodgers made \"a rather free allusion to Polly,\" he had exploded in rage, \"shouting at him that if any fellow tried that sort of a game on with his sister he'd bloody well put his teeth down his throat, so he would.\"\n Doran has \"a notion that he was being had.\" The Mooneys are beneath him socially, Polly seems \"a little vulgar,\" and \"His instinct urged him to remain free, not to marry. Once you are married you are done for, it said.\" But the conclusion of his drama, untold in Joyce's story, seems foreordained. Ulysses supplies the aftermath. M'Coy tells Bloom that Doran is on \"one of his periodical bends,\" and Bloom thinks later that these are \"annual.\" The narrator of Cyclops spots him \"sitting up there in the corner that I hadn’t seen snoring drunk blind to the world.\" Awakened by the loud conversation in the pub, he joins in with a memorable mixture of befuddlement, belligerence, and blubbering sentimentality.\n One memorable paragraph of the narrator's infectiously mean-spirited monologue supplies plenty of scuttlebutt to round out the picture: \"And off with him and out trying to walk straight. Boosed at five o’clock. Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the bobby, 14A. Blind to the world up in a shebeen in Bride street after closing time, fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard, drinking porter out of teacups. And calling himself a Frenchy for the shawls, Joseph Manuo, and talking against the Catholic religion, and he serving mass in Adam and Eve’s when he was young with his eyes shut, who wrote the new testament, and the old testament, and hugging and smugging. And the two shawls killed with the laughing, picking his pockets, the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another. How is your testament? Have you got an old testament? Only Paddy was passing there, I tell you what. Then see him of a Sunday with his little concubine of a wife, and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her, no less, and her violets, nice as pie, doing the little lady. Jack Mooney’s sister. And the old prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples. Gob, Jack made him toe the line. Told him if he didn’t patch up the pot, Jesus, he’d kick the shite out of him.\"\n Many details are worth noting here: Polly's ascent into prim bourgeois respectability (the narrator has earlier recalled a report of her \"stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her, exposing her person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour\"), her husband's periodic descents into prostitution to obtain some facsimile of erotic satisfaction (a report that is seconded in Lestrygonians when Bloom thinks of him \"Up in the Coombe with chummies and streetwalkers\"), the alleged descent of the mother-in-law's house into a similarly disreputable condition (\"procuring rooms to street couples\"), and Doran's renewed antipathy to \"the Catholic religion.\" \n In the short story Joyce says of Doran that \"As a young man he had sown his wild oats, of course; he had boasted of his free-thinking and denied the existence of God to his companions in public-houses. But that was all passed and done with . . . nearly.\" The crisis in the Hardwicke Street house sends him back to the bosom of mother church. Having allowed it to sink the talons of guilt into him, and having paid dearly in \"reparation,\" Doran now loudly profanes the faith: \"Who said Christ is good? . . . Is that a good Christ, says Bob Doran, to take away poor little Willy Dignam? . . . He's a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willy Dignam.\" The narrator, showing the pro forma embrace of piety typical of male Dubliners, pronounces Doran the \"lowest blackguard in Dublin when he’s under the influence.\""

With the notable exception of Bloom's destination in this chapter, the pork butcher's shop, all of them (indeed, all the businesses in the novel) were actual establishments. Viewed on a map, they constitute a kind of Shopper's Guide to the more commercial eastern half of Dublin.",
    "expandedNote": " As Bloom walks down the sunny side of Eccles Street \"in happy warmth,\" he sees or thinks of \"Boland's breadvan\" delivering warm freshly baked loaves of bread. The largest bakery in Dublin in 1904, Boland's had a large fleet of vans to distribute its products to shops, restaurants, and houses throughout the city. The Boland family lived on Capel Street, which starts across the river from Temple Bar and runs north. They built their first bakery at 134-136 Capel. As the business expanded it opened new facilities, including a large flour mill, silos, and warehouses on the Grand Canal Quay near Ringsend, and ornately appointed retail stores at various locations. (The vans, soon afterward equipped with gasoline engines, continued motoring about the capital for most of the 20th century. In the 1970s Boland's merged with Jacobs Biscuits Ltd., the firm whose biscuit tin the Citizen throws at Bloom in Cyclops, to form Irish Biscuits Ltd.)\n Passing by O'Rourke's pub at the east end of Eccles Street (and Cassidy's liquor store across the street), Bloom turns right onto Dorset Street. Before leaving the house he has rejected the idea of buying \"a mutton kidney at Buckley's\" in favor of \"a pork kidney at Dlugacz's.\" Both shops are on Dorset Street Upper, Buckley's at number 48 and Dlugacz perhaps at 55A (the actual butcher at that address was named Michael Brunton). As he is standing in Dlugacz's shop, the girl in front of him orders \"a pound and a half of Denny's sausages,\" which came from Limerick. Buying meat on Dorset Street Upper is a frequent trek for Bloom; in Penelope Molly thinks, \"Im sick of that everlasting butchers meat from Buckleys.\" \n If Bloom had turned left onto Dorset Street Lower (moving northeast, away from the center of town) he would have come to two other businesses mentioned in Calypso. \"Hanlon's milkman,\" who has delivered the morning's milk in an anonymous urban equivalent of the old woman's personable visit to the tower in Telemachus, probably works for S. Hanlon, a dairyman at number 26. And \"M'Auley's down there\" (toward the North Circular Road from where Bloom is standing on O'Rourke's corner) is Thomas M'Auley, grocer and wine merchant at number 39. Bloom thinks that M'Auley's location is \"n.g.\" (i.e., no good) because it is too far north: O'Rourke's is \"just the end of the city traffic.\"\n As Bloom walks back home along Dorset Street Upper reading an ad for a Palestinian farm, he thinks of \"Silverpowdered olivetrees. Quiet long days: pruning, ripening. Olives are packed in jars, eh? I have a few left from Andrews.\" According to the 1904 Thom'sdirectory, Andrews & Co. were tea and coffee dealers, wine and spirit merchants, and Italian warehousers at 19-22 Dame Street, in the heart of central Dublin on the south side of the river, just south of Temple Bar. They were a place to find exotic delicacies. In Circe Bloom thinks, \"Try truffles at Andrews.\"\n Several other businesses pop up from the southeastern part of the city. The \"high grade ha\"(t) that Bloom takes off a peg on his hallstand comes from \"Plasto's,\" owned by hatmaker John Plasto, at 1 Great Brunswick (now Pearse) Street, south of the river several blocks from Sackville (now O'Connell) Street. The funeral procession passes it in Hades, and Sirens glimpses Blazes Boylan \"wearing a straw hat very dressy, bought of John Plasto of number one Great Brunswick street, hatter.\"\n Bloom also thinks of an argument he had with Milly \"in the XL Cafe\" at 86 Grafton Street. Grafton is a fashionable shopping street southwest of Trinity College. Two blocks east of Grafton lies Dawson Street, where Adolphe Drago, hairdresser and wigmaker, had one of two \"Drago's\" shops. In Lestrygonians Bloom sees a dye-maker's van parked in front. (The other shop was at 36 Henry Street, north of the river near Sackville Street.) And, finally, Bloom thinks of a performance of Ponchielli's dance of the hours by \"May's band,\" which Gifford notes was maintained and supplied by the music sellers May & Co. at 130 St. Stephen's Green West.\n Bloom also thinks in Calypso of the Capel Street library where he must renew a book he has checked out, and of a nearby music business at 14 Capel Street run by a man named Kearney, his \"guarantor.\" He remembers visiting Hengler's circus, which performed at the Rotunda on Parnell Square, at the north end of Sackville Street. And he contemplates visiting the Tara Street baths, north of Trinity College on the way to the Custom House."

    "note": " The cruelties depicted in Ruby: the Pride of the Ring turn Bloom's thoughts to acts that he has personally witnessed in circuses: \"Cruelty behind it all. Doped animals. Trapeze at Hengler's. Had to look the other way. Mob gaping. Break your neck and we'll break our sides. Families of them. Bone them young so they metempsychosis.\" The training of trapeze acrobats from a very young age, so that they could carry on a family tradition, strangely brings him back to the word whose appearance in the novel Molly has asked him about.",
    "expandedNote": " \"Hengler's Royal Circus\" is mentioned in Eumaeus as well as Calypso. Like most of the larger Victorian circuses, it staged its acts in large permanent structures (often round, hence the name) rather than in tents. Frederick \"Charles\" Hengler (1820-87), one of the great circus managers of the 19th century, directed the construction of such buildings—sometimes called \"hippodromes,\" to reflect his emphasis on equestrian acts—in various Scottish and English cities. When his circus came to Dublin, they apparently performed in the Rotunda, a large round performance space on Rutland Square. By the end of the century circuses were a staple of middle-class entertainment. \n Along with bareback riding tricks, Victorian circuses featured human acrobatic brilliance in the form of \"Trapeze\" acts, stunts performed in the air on swinging horizontal bars suspended from ropes, including the \"flying\" tricks initiated in Paris by Jean Leotard in 1859. Many trapeze artists grew up in families—a tradition which the Wallendas and many others have continued to the present day. When Bloom thinks \"Bone them young,\" he is apparently using the verb in the sense of intensively studying in preparation for something, as in \"Bone up on your Italian before the trip.\" \n How such boning might cause young people to \"metempsychosis\" (another noun that Bloom uses as a verb) is anybody's guess. It is a very strange sentence. One possible interpretation is that Bloom is thinking of trapeze artistry as a kind of exotic life form: early training helps children metamorphose into the spectacular butterflies that eventually flit from bar to bar. (When he tries to explain metempsychosis to Molly \"in plain words,\" he briefly confuses it with metamorphosis.) \n Gifford infers that \"Bloom has apparently witnessed a trapeze accident at the circus,\" but it is possible that he has merely been disturbed by the business of exploiting danger to sell tickets. Mobs will gape at actual falls, but they also will gape at feats that might result in a fall, their pleasure at the athleticism heightened by their awareness of the potential for bodily injury. It seems somehow fitting of Bloom's timidity and pacifism to suppose that he \"Had to look the other way\" merely because some death-defying trick was whipping the crowd into a frenzy."

  "050025botanicgardens": {
    "note": " Next to the Prospect Cemetery in Glasnevin lies another beautifully tended expanse of open land, the \"Botanic Gardens.\" In Lotus Eaters Bloom imagines the steamy air in the \"Hothouse\" as a local slice of Ceylon, source of fine teas and \"the garden of the world.\" In Hades he thinks of the gardens in connection with the adjacent cemetery and with the \"Mount Jerome\" Protestant cemetery, which lies on the south side of Dublin in Harold's Cross. In Ithaca he dreams about having botanical wonders on his own property.",
    "expandedNote": " After the Irish Parliament in 1790 appropriated funds to the Dublin Society for the founding of a public garden, one was established on 48 acres (19.5 hectares) of Glasnevin floodplain between the River Tolka and what later became the Prospect Cemetery (124 acres/50 hectares). The mission of the gardens was, and is, to promote horticultural knowledge useful to agriculture, medicine, and industry and to provide visitors access to sites of tranquil beauty—admission is free even today. In addition to many thousands of living species, millions of dried specimens are stored on site. During the famine years of the 1840s, researchers at the Botanic Gardens identified the fungus responsible for the potato blight and labored to arrest its progress. \n The grounds feature a number of architecturally striking Victorian greenhouses. When Bloom thinks of the \"Hothouse,\" he probably is recalling a visit to the Great Palm House, a white iron-and-glass structure built to house plants collected from warm regions of the Empire. Constructed in 1883 after a violent storm damaged an earlier wooden version, the new building was designed by Richard Turner, a Dublin-born iron founder who had already built the Curvilinear Range of glasshouses in the Botanic Gardens, as well as similar grand structures in Belfast and the Kew Gardens outside of London. The Palm House contains tropical and subtropical species large and small, and an adjacent building houses hundreds of varieties of orchids. Bloom thinks, \"Sensitive plants. Waterlilies. Petals too tired to. Sleeping sickness in the air.\" \n Bloom may also be aware of another Botanic Gardens facility in County Wicklow. In Eumaeus he expresses a desire to escape \"the grind of city life in the summertime for choice when dame Nature is at her spectacular best constituting nothing short of a new lease of life. There were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home island, delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation, offering a plethora of attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around Dublin and its picturesque environs even, Poulaphouca to which there was a steamtram, but also farther away from the madding crowd in Wicklow, rightly termed the garden of Ireland.\" The Botanic Gardens manages a second facility at Kilmacurragh, about 40 miles south of Dublin, where a milder winter climate and more acidic soil permit outdoor cultivation of a wider range of plants. The arboretum and gardens there, on 52 acres surrounding a Queen Anne-style house (now derelict), were established in 1712 and expanded in the 19th century through association with the Botanic Gardens. In addition to this national treasure, County Wicklow has magnificent country estate gardens at Mount Usher (laid out in 1868), Powerscourt (likewise mostly late 19th century), and Kilruddery House near Bray Head (mostly designed in the late 17th century).\n Standing in the lushly planted and well-tended Prospect cemetery in Hades, Bloom thinks that it and the Protestant cemetery in Harold's Cross deserve to be called gardens: \"And very neat he keeps it too: trim grass and edgings. His garden Major Gamble calls Mount Jerome. Well, so it is. Ought to be flowers of sleep. Chinese cemeteries with giant poppies growing produce the best opium Mastiansky told me. The Botanic Gardens are just over there. It's the blood sinking in the earth gives new life.\" Bloom seems to have very little gardening experience, but he likes to consider the kinds of nutrients that plants would appreciate. At the end of Calypso his thoughts center on excrement. In the passage just cited from Hades they turn more macabre. Channeling Jonathan Swift, he whimsically ponders the possibilities for marketing human flesh as compost: \"Well preserved fat corpse, gentleman, epicure, invaluable for fruit garden. A bargain. By carcass of William Wilkinson, auditor and accountant, lately deceased, three pounds thirteen and six. With thanks.\" As an \"epicure,\" Mr. Wilkinson will himself have been well supplied with nutrients, so the plants are bound to respond well to his remains. \n Bloom's fantasies of lush gardens reach their apogee in Ithaca, when he imagines coming into possession of a rich country estate. The property will be called \"Flowerville,\" and its grounds will contain \"a shrubbery, a glass summerhouse with tropical palms, equipped in the best botanical manner, a rockery with waterspray, a beehive arranged on humane principles, oval flowerbeds in rectangular grassplots set with eccentric ellipses of scarlet and chrome tulips, blue scillas, crocuses, polyanthus, sweet William, sweet pea, lily of the valley (bulbs obtainable from sir James W. Mackey (Limited) wholesale and retail seed and bulb merchants and nurserymen, agents for chemical manures, 23 Sackville street, upper), an orchard, kitchen garden and vinery, protected against illegal trespassers by glasstopped mural enclosures, a lumbershed with padlock for various inventoried implements.\" In time, Bloom thinks, he may add \"A rabbitry and fowlrun, a dovecote, a botanical conservatory, 2 hammocks (lady’s and gentleman’s), a sundial shaded and sheltered by laburnum or lilac trees, an exotically harmonically accorded Japanese tinkle gatebell affixed to left lateral gatepost, a capacious waterbutt, a lawnmower with side delivery and grassbox, a lawnsprinkler with hydraulic hose.\" \n Various features of this fantasy seem to have been inspired by visits to the Botanical Gardens. The \"glass summerhouse with tropical palms, equipped in the best botanical manner\" certainly recalls the Palm House, and the \"botanical conservatory\" alludes to the scientific facilities encyclopedically stocked with specimens. The grounds of the Botanic Gardens have probably inspired many of his outdoor plantings as well. Features as diverse as \"a rockery\" and geometrically arranged flowerbeds can be found there, and, according to a Catalogue of Plants in the Dublin Society's Botanic Garden, at Glasnevin (1802), the plantings include all of the flowers mentioned in Ithaca: tulips, scillas, crocuses, polyanthus, sweet William, sweet pea, and lily of the valley. \n Asking itself whether Bloom of 7 Eccles Street could foresee Bloom of Flowerville, Ithaca's narrative answers its question with a picture worthy of a clothing catalogue: \"In loose allwool garments with Harris tweed cap, price 8/6, and useful garden boots with elastic gussets and wateringcan, planting aligned young firtrees, syringing, pruning, staking, sowing hayseed, trundling a weedladen wheelbarrow without excessive fatigue at sunset amid the scent of newmown hay, ameliorating the soil, multiplying wisdom, achieving longevity.\"\n The novel makes at least one more tacit reference to the Botanic Gardens in Circe when Mrs. Bellingham testifies against Bloom. In addition to his heinous sexual crimes, even Bloom's tender romantic overtures have, upon scientific inspection, proved to be damnably false: \"Subsequently he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in my honour. I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.\" \n Allusions gloriously intertwine here. Edelweiss is a short-blooming flower found sparsely scattered on steep, rocky alpine slopes. The devoted Bloom has purportedly traveled abroad and trudged to some rugged, icy peak to bring back a \"bloom\" of this exotic plant for his dearly beloved. (Folk traditions in the Alps prescribe exactly such shows of devotion.) But his beloved, motivated by deep distrust and perhaps aided by her aristocratic people's connections in theCastle, has taken the flower to be examined by a government-salaried scientist at the Botanical Gardens, and that \"expert,\" possessing a deep familiarity with the \"homegrown potato plant\" by virtue of his facility's work on the fungal blight, has instantly spotted the fraud. Moreover, the scientist has somehow determined that this particular potato flower was stolen from a tray of specimens on a \"model farm,\" presumably the one \"at Kinnereth on the lakeshore of Tiberias\" that Bloom has read about in Calypso. \n Once more, then, Leopold Bloom has been exposed as a shameless and total fraud. His purported knowledge of matters horticultural (not to mention his capacity for romantic tenderness) is as baseless as his social respectability, his literary authorship, his service in Her Majesty's armed forces, his messianic wisdom, his Christianity, his kindness to animals, and all other virtues which unprincipled defenders can think to enumerate."

  "170012boustrophedontic": {
    "note": " Among the contents of the drawers in Bloom's desk described in Ithaca are three typewritten letters from Martha Clifford to Henry Flower, and, perhaps on a separate slip of paper, \"the transliterated name and address of the addresser of the 3 letters in reversed alphabetic boustrophedontic punctated quadrilinear cryptogram (vowels suppressed).\" The cryptic writing is reproduced more or less (in various editions of the novel) as follows: \"N. IGS. /WI. UU. OX/W. OKS. MH/Y. IM.\" Its meaning is fun to decode, but not at all surprising.",
    "expandedNote": "In brief, here is how the code translates, with lower-case letters in the second line indicating parts of the message that have been left out, namely all of the vowels:\n N. IGS. /WI. UU. OX/W. OKS. MH/Y. IM\n MaRTHa/DRoFFiLC/DoLPHiNS/BaRN\n Bloom has \"suppressed\" the vowels because, as Gifford observes, it \"makes a simple code such as this harder to crack, since the patterned frequency of vowel recurrence makes the words relatively easy to spot.\" In an additional act of subterfuge, he has reversed the order of the letters in Martha's surname, turning Clifford into Droffilc. \n The coded letters have been generated by laying out the 26 letters of the alphabet from A to Z, writing below them the same letters arranged Z to A, and substituting Z for A, Y for B, and so forth. The method is dubbed \"boustrophedontic\" because, in ancient Greece, stone tablets were often covered with writing that began by moving left to right, then moved right to left on the next line (with the letters themselves reversed in appearance, which Bloom does not do), and so on, in the manner of an ox plowing furrows in a field (bous = ox, strophe = turning, don = in the manner of).\n In a fanciful turn typical of this chapter, Bloom's boustrophedonic writing is also termed \"quadrilinear,\" apparently because he has inserted forward slashes between the four coded words. Quadrilinear literally means having four lines, but there are only three lines in this line of code. Perhaps the sense is that three lines separate the text into four quadrants?! The text is also said to be \"punctuated,\" because, in every place where a vowel has been removed, Bloom has inserted a period or full stop followed by a space, as would happen at the end of a sentence. Finally, it is described as \"reversed,\" a detail that seems redundant because \"boustrophedontic\" says the same thing. But perhaps this refers merely to the second word, Droffilc.\n As a ruse for concealing clandestine correspondence, all of this is ludicrous. Molly hardly needs to cultivate her codebreaking skills: she already has a sense of what is going on. And if she gained access to the drawer where the coded name and address reside, could she not simply read them from Martha's letters, which are said to lie in the same drawer? The absurdity characterizes Bloom's sense of high secrecy where adulterous feelings are concerned (his wife's approach could not be more different), and it suits the linguistic playfulness of Ithaca, down even to the way its sense of exhaustive exactitude is undermined by details like \"quadrilinear\" and \"reversed.\" This passage captures some of the wild comedy one finds in the passages in Samuel Pepys' Diary where the author communicates his adulterous exploits in coded language that is both absurdly inventive and self-defeatingly transparent.\n There is an alternative to \"reversed,\" the word that appears in the first edition and the Gabler edition, but it brings redundancy of its own. The Odyssey Press editions of the 1930s and the Penguin and Random House texts deriving from the 1960 Bodley Head edition all read \"reserved,\" which, Gifford suggests, could mean \"to keep from being known to others.\" But don't all cryptograms do that?\n Different texts also disagree on the spaces between the coded letters. The Gabler edition corrects what appears to be a mistake in earlier texts by inserting a period and space between \"WI\" and \"UU,\" where the \"o\" of Clifford belongs. But it does not supply one after \"IGS,\" where the final \"a\" of Martha belongs. The final Odyssey Press edition of 1939 gets the \"a\" space right but misses the \"o\" one. No edition that I have looked at seems to convey Joyce's intention perfectly, so in the text displayed on this website I offer a unique version."

    "note": " In Proteus Stephen thinks of a recent drowning in Dublin Bay and associates it with his inability to save his dying mother: \"A drowning man. His human eyes scream to me out of horror of his death. I... With him together down... I could not save her. Waters: bitter death: lost.\" Later in the same chapter he anticipates the recovery of the drowned man's body and imagines \"the stench of his green grave.\" In both passages he is recalling a complex of associations that crowded into his mind in Telemachus, linking the green seawater with the death of his mother, and linking his fear of drowning with his fear of being swallowed up in guilt.",
    "expandedNote": " Looking out over Dublin Bay from the top of the Sandycove tower in the first chapter, Stephen makes a mental connection to the bowl that sat beside his mother's sickbed: \"The ring of bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid. A bowl of white china had stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting.\" He thinks of the connection again after Mulligan goes down to the living quarters, and he sees a cloud \"shadowing the bay in deeper green. It lay behind him, a bowl of bitter waters.\"\n Mulligan has probably helped to shape Stephen's associative connections, with his comment about \"The snotgreen sea,\" and his suggestion that it should be called \"a great sweet mother,\" or \"Our mighty mother!\" Yeats has reinforced the bitterness of the green bile, by singing of “love’s bitter mystery”—a song that makes Stephen think of his mother. The memory of the \"square ditch\" at Clongowes, with its unhealthy green \"scum,\" has no doubt played its part as well. \n JH 2015"

  "010128bowsy": {
    "note": " In the first chapter Mulligan's mocking, playful, imitative voice is filled not only with many echoes of upper-crust British speech (\"old chap,\" \"spiffing,\" \"dreadful,\" \"beastly\"), but also with many scruffier idioms particular to Dublin and Ireland. Some of the latter, like \"scutter\" and \"bowsy,\" require annotation for non-natives.",
    "expandedNote": " After frowning \"at the lather on his razorblade,\" Mulligan utters an obscure imprecation: \"— Scutter! he cried thickly.\" According to Kiberd, in Dublin slang it is \"a dismissive term; it means a watery stool.\" Slote cites a definition in the OED: \"a variant of squitter, 'to have diarrhoea.'\" Just before grabbing Stephen's handkerchief out of his pocket, then, Mulligan seems to be saying something like, \"Would you look at all this shit on my razor!\"\n A little later, he says of the black \"secondhand breeks\" (dialectical for breeches, britches, trousers, pants) that he has somehow obtained for Stephen, \"God knows what poxy bowsy left them off.\" In Dublin slang a bowsy (bowsie, bowsey) is a disreputable, ill-behaved, good-for-nothing male. Gifford cites one Gerry O'Flaherty, quoted in a book titled Dublin (1983) as saying that a bowsie is \"an unemployed layabout who loves nothing better than to shout abusive remarks, usually of a sexual nature, after passing girls.\" Imagining this lout also to have been disease-ridden is hardly calculated to make the recipient of the clothes feel comfortable in them.\n When Mulligan tries to coax Stephen down from the parapet to have breakfast with Haines, he says: \"Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey.\" Kiberd identifies this as Dublin slang for a wanderer, \"often used as a term of endearment.\" The word can have other meanings, however. Gifford suggests \"Someone who strolls slowly or shuffles\"—the familiar American meaning, which would make the summons somewhat less friendly. Slote cites a definition in the English Dialect Dictionary, \"Idiot or fool,\" which would remove all affection.\n Later, immersed in smoke while making breakfast, Mulligan exclaims, \"Janey Mack, I'm choked!\" Gifford cites this as an instance of \"what the Irish call 'dodging the curse,' a euphemistic form of Jesus Jack.\" He notes also that this weak curse is commonly used in Ireland, and cites lines from a children's rhyme: \"Janey Mac, me shirt is black, / What'll I do for Sunday? / Go to bed and cover me head / And not get up till Monday.\" A very similar curse-dodging follows a few sentences later: \"Where's the sugar? O, jay, there's no milk.\" \"Jay\" here stands in for Jesus."

    "note": " The anonymous Irish song that Kevin Egan taught his son Patrice, \"The boys of Kilkenny,\" lauds the charms of the town. But it concludes on a note of exilic loneliness, which probably explains Egan's attachment to it.",
    "expandedNote": " In the version reproduced in Alfred Moffat's The Minstrelsy of Ireland: 206 Irish Songs (4th ed., 1897), the song begins,\n Oh! the boys of Kilkenny are stout roving blades\n And if ever they meet with the nice little maids, \n They kiss them and coax them, they spend their money free.\n Oh! of all towns in Ireland, Kilkenny for me. \n Oh! of all towns in Ireland, Kilkenny for me.\n The second and third stanzas wax lyrical about the beauty of the town's natural setting and the beauty of a woman whom the singer knew there. But she apparently rejected him, and in the last stanza this sadness gives way to the deeper sadness of nostalgia: \n Oh! Kilkenny's a town that shines where it stands,\n And the more I think on it, the more my heart warms,\n And if in Kilkenny I'd think myself home,\n For it's there I'd get sweethearts but here I get none.\n For it's there I'd get sweethearts but here I get none.\n As Zack Bowen observes (Musical Allusions in the Works of James Joyce, 77), these melancholy words are \"much closer to Egan's exiled position\" than the rest of the song. Stephen is apparently familiar with them, because in the following sentences he thinks of two more exiles' laments, alluding to \"Napper Tandy\" and to the Jews' longing for \"Sion.\" The words also evoke Egan's separation from his wife: \"Loveless, landless, wifeless. She is quite nicey comfy without her outcast man, madame in rue Git-le-Coeur, canary and two buck lodgers. Peachy cheeks, a zebra skirt, frisky as a young thing's.\""

  "040085brassquoits": {
    "note": " A dictionary offers only minimal help in understanding what Joyce may have meant in Calypso by referring to \"the loose brass quoits\" of the Blooms' bed. His usage appears to be metaphorical, evoking some feature of the bedposts by comparing them to the iron rings of a horseshoes-like game played throughout the British Isles, often in pub settings.",
    "expandedNote": " The game of quoits is ancient, probably having descended from the sport of discus throwing. Players throw iron or steel rings at spikes set in squares of moist clay. Like dinner plates with the bottoms cut away, the rings are concave on one side and convex on the other, helping them dig into the clay when skillfully thrown. Points are scored by landing rings close to the stake or, in some versions of the game, by encircling it.\n Joyce evidently is using the iron rings to name some similarly shaped structures on the brass bed that Molly's father brought over the water from Gibraltar. One might suppose by analogy that the \"quoits\" are rings encircling the rods at the head and foot of the bed. Gifford does: \"The quoits are the brass discs that decorate the metal rods supporting the bedstead.\" But Victorian brass beds do not seem ever to have had decorative elements of this sort, and a sliding ring would not fit with Bloom's reflection that the discs have worked loose and should be secured: \"Must get those settled really. Pity. All the way from Gibraltar.\" The word, then, more likely refers to washers that help secure the finials to the bedposts, or perhaps to caps that are fitted to the tops of the posts. \n Although the text does not describe the shape or function of the quoits, a reader might be forgiven for hearing lascivious suggestions in the thought of concave rings encircling stiff spikes. They seem to inhabit the same imagistic universe as a horse named Sceptre aiming for the Gold Cup, or a \"loud proud knocker\" announcing its presence in a welcoming doorway. This suspicion is abundantly confirmed by the novel's treatment of the noise that the quoits make. Calypso says simply that they \"jingled,\" but in later chapters the jingling sound acquires a wealth ofsexual suggestions."

  "010066brayhead": {
    "note": " When Stephen and Mulligan stand \"looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on the water like the snout of a sleeping whale,\" they cannot actually see it from the Sandycove tower. But this prominent landmark in the northern part of County Wicklow, praised as one of the glories of Ireland in Cyclops, is not very far away. It stands just beyond the prosperous seaside community of Bray where Stephen grew up, and where Molly and Bloom once took a small boat out on the waves.",
    "expandedNote": " The fact that Bray Head cannot be seen from the Tower raises the question of whether Joyce's memory failed him when he described Stephen and Mulligan looking in that direction. But the narrative says only that they are looking \"towards\" the cape. In an article in JJQ 20 (1982), \"Can Bray Head Be Seen from the Martello Tower?,\" Robert Boyle argues that Joyce probably knows what he is doing, and is representing Stephen thinking of Bray \"in the mind's eye,\" being \"drawn by memories of his mother and of the earliest shelter he could remember leaving, as he intends to leave this tower\" (131). \n Finerty's photograph from the 1890s shows the seawall promenade that runs toward Bray Head along a 1.6 km walkable beach. Stanislaus Joyce mentions the view of it from the Joyces' house very near the coast on Martello Terrace: \"From our windows we had a long view of the Esplanade, which stretched along the sea-front half the way to Bray Head\" (My Brother's Keeper, 4). This elegant mile-long promenade was built during the Victorian era, at a time when moneyed middle-class Dubliners were moving to Bray to escape the press of city life while remaining within commuting distance. The extension of the Dublin and Kingstown Railway to the town in 1854 transformed Bray into a comfortable suburban resort destination. \n The Joyce family lived on Martello Terrace from 1887 to 1892, when they were still comfortably well off. The Bray home is represented in A Portrait of the Artist, in the magnificent Christmas dinner scene in which Simon Dedalus squares off against Dante O'Riordain over the tragic death of Charles Stewart Parnell. One of Joyce's memories from those days surfaces in Calypso, when Bloom mentally recites a little love poem to his daughter.\n In Penelope Molly recalls a nearly disastrous outing off the Bray coast: \"Id never again in this life get into a boat with him after him at Bray telling the boatman he knew how to row if anyone asked could he ride the steeplechase for the gold cup hed say yes then it came on to get rough the old thing crookeding about and the weight all down my side telling me pull the right reins now pull the left and the tide all swamping in floods in through the bottom and his oar slipping out of the stirrup its a mercy we werent all drowned he can swim of course me no theres no danger whatsoever keep yourself calm in his flannel trousers Id like to have tattered them down off him before all the people and give him what that one calls flagellate till he was black and blue do him all the good in the world.\" Rowing clubs keep seagoing rowboats on the Bray beach to this day, ready to launch into the choppy water."

  "010061breaknews": {
    "note": " \"Break the news to her gently,\" a phrase heard as Stephen imagines students in their rooms at Oxford, alludes to a popular song of the 1890s, though there are two candidates. This reference in Telemachus is the first of many instances in which the strains of popular songs from the streets, music halls, and drawing rooms waft through the verbal textures of Ulysses. Together with the more exalted strains like operatic arias, they provoke lingering aural resonances in the mind of any reader who knows the tunes. One cannot adequately “read” the novel without hearing these many melodic allusions.",
    "expandedNote": " The allusion may be to Charles K. Harris' Break the News to Mother (1897). The composer of After the Ball, the first song to sell five million copies in sheet music, Harris wrote the sentimental and patriotic Break the News to Mother during the Spanish American War. When a new war came along twenty years later to renew patriotic fervor, his enormously popular song was revived to beat the drum once more. According to the publisher, it became the #2 hit of World War I, second only to George M. Cohan’s Over There. \n Harris’ song tells the story of a young man who responds to his captain’s call to run through enemy fire to retrieve a fallen flag. He “Saved the flag but gave his young life, / All for his country’s sake,” and as he is dying he gasps the words of the chorus:\n Just break the news to Mother, she knows how dear I love her\n And tell her not to wait for me, for I’m not coming home; \n Just say there is no other can take the place of Mother\n Then kiss her dear sweet lips for me, and break the news to \n her.\n “From afar a noted Gen’ral” witnesses the brave deed and comes to see the man who did it, only to find that it is his own son, an under-age boy whom he thought “safe at home.” The boy says, “Forgive me, father, for I ran away,\" and the Chorus repeats.\nThornton, and Gifford and Seidman after him, cite Harris’ song as the likely source of Stephen’s phrase, but as Thornton notes, several \"slightly different\" versions of the song circulated. The closest analogue, not cited by any of the commentators, is a song from earlier in the 1890s that Harris’ composition apparently updated. This song, whose lyrics were apparently written by Edward B. Marks, tells a very similar tearjerking tale in which the heroism is supplied by firefighters. A young hero has given his life to rescue a small child, and now lies dying:\n Break the news to mother gently, tell her how her brave son \n died;\n Tell her that he did his duty, as in life he ever tried. \n Treat her kindly, boys, a friend be to her when I’m dead and\n gone,\n Break the news to mother gently, do not let her weep or \n mourn.\n Stephen's inclusion of the word \"gently\" may indicate that he is thinking of this version. Elizabeth C. Axford’s Song Sheets to Software, 2nd ed. (2004) attributes its 1892 composition to Joe Stern, but other publications say it was written by Will H. Fox."

Old shrunken paps.” In Calypso Bloom stands beside Molly's bed, looking “calmly down on her bulk and between her large soft bubs, sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat’s udder.”Circe recalls the goat's udders when Bello taunts Bloom for trying on Molly's clothes, displaying \"behind closedrawn blinds your unskirted thighs and hegoat's udders in various poses of surrender.\"\n Interestingly, Bloom's association of his wife's udders with a goat's seems to have been formed at a moment of high sexual excitement when he was quite aware of her breasts as young, full, and enticing. He recalls the rapturous scene in Lestrygonians: \"She lay still. A goat. No-one. High on Ben Howth rhododendrons a nannygoat walking surefooted, dropping currants. Screened under ferns she laughed warmfolded. Wildly I lay on her, kissed her: eyes, her lips, her stretched neck beating, woman's breasts full in her blouse of nun's veiling, fat nipples upright. Hot I tongued her. She kissed me. I was kissed. All yielding she tossed my hair. Kissed, she kissed me.\" In Circe the Howth goat returns, its full organs mirroring Molly's: \"High on Ben Howth through rhododendrons a nannygoat passes, plumpuddered, buttytailed, dropping currants.\" \n In Penelope Molly condenses into a short space thoughts about the pleasures of sucking on nipples, the purported beauty of breasts, their clear biological purpose, and the general grotesquerie of sexual organs: \"yes I think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he made me thirsty titties he calls them I had to laugh yes this one anyhow stiff the nipple gets for the least thing Ill get him to keep that up and Ill take those eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out for him what are all those veins and things curious the way its made 2 the same in case of twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up there like those statues in the museum one of them pretending to hide it with her hand are they so beautiful of course compared with what a man looks like with his two bags full and his other thing hanging down out of him or sticking up at you like a hatrack no wonder they hide it with a cabbageleaf.\" \n There is more. Moments later, Boylan's love of sucking makes her think of men's strange urge to become infants again, and of her strange request to have Bloom suck her when she was enduring the pain of weaning Milly, and of his strange enthusiasm for using human milk as a food ingredient: \"theres the mark of his teeth still where he tried to bite the nipple I had to scream out arent they fearful trying to hurt you I had a great breast of milk with Milly enough for two what was the reason of that he said I could have got a pound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning that delicate looking student that stopped in no 28 with the Citrons Penrose nearly caught me washing through the window only for I snapped up the towel to my face that was his studenting hurt me they used to weaning her till he got doctor Brady to give me the belladonna prescription I had to get him to suck them they were so hard he said it was sweeter and thicker than cows then he wanted to milk me into the tea well hes beyond everything I declare somebody ought to put him in the budget if I only could remember the one half of the things and write a book out of it the works of Master Poldy yes and its so much smoother the skin much an hour he was at them Im sure by the clock like some kind of a big infant I had at me they want everything in their mouth all the pleasure those men get out of a woman.\""

  "120016bretelles": {
    "note": " In the Cyclopean account of the wedding of \"Miss Fir Conifer of Pine Valley,\" the bride's dress is said to be composed of \"green mercerised silk, moulded on an underslip of gloaming grey, sashed with a yoke of broad emerald and finished with a triple flounce of darkerhued fringe, the scheme being relieved by bretelles and hip insertions of acorn bronze.\" Bretelles, in late 19th century fashion, were decorative straps that passed over the shoulders from a belt at the front of a woman's dress to the belt in back, making two large V shapes. Joyce's \"hip insertions\" may be the hip bustles that Victorian women wore under dresses to affect shape and drape, but the mention of their color suggests an ornamentation on top of the dress.",
    "expandedNote": "Bretelles have passed out of fashion vocabulary today, but they still appear in some reference works like the Merriam-Webster online dictionary and Dictionary.com, which both define them as ornamental shoulder straps attaching to a belt or waistband at the front and back of a dress. In a glossary of Victorian fashion terms, the Kate Tattersall website goes into more detail: \"Bretelles referred to a pair of ornamental suspender-like shoulder strap accessories that appeared as a fashion term around 1850. The straps were decorative, crafted of quality wool or silk, trimmed with lace, buckles, bows, &c., to set off a particular outfit or provide variety to a lady’s wardrobe. The straps were worn over a bodice then tied and tucked into a skirt or attached to a matching belt. Of note, the word was used interchangeably with the masculine form of pantaloon suspenders: plain elasticated straps with adjustable buckles for men. (These soon became known as braces and suspenders.)\" In France, where the term originated, it now apparently refers only to straps or braces in a generic sense, or to men's suspenders. \n In a personal communication, Ruth Wüst has directed my attention to the illustration shown here from the French weekly fashion magazine La Mode Illustrée, which had many subscribers in the U.K. The drawing vividly conveys the decorative quality of early bretelles, showing their adornment with a lacy fringe on the outside edges of the straps, ribbons tied in bows at the shoulders and attachment points, a different kind of flat fringe at the inside edges, and textured ribs running both parallel and perpendicular to the direction of the straps.\n Wüst observes also that hip pads were fashionable at the turn of the century, citing their mention on the website of the FIDM Museum in Los Angeles. Of the model shown here, the site's curators remark that \"To emphasize or create a womanly figure, women could wear hip pads, sometimes called hip bustles. This particular hip pad is labeled 'The Scott' and is made of cotton lightly padded with horsehair. According to its still attached (!) label, The Scott was 'especially adapted for very slight figures having no side or back hips.' This slight augmentation of a slender figure would help skirts 'hang and drape gracefully'.\" \n If Joyce's \"hip insertions\" refers to such a padding device, then perhaps Miss Fir Conifer is a slender sapling. But the context in which the phrase appears suggests the possibility of a different fashion accessory. One can easily imagine how bretelles of an \"acorn bronze\" hue would attractively offset the greens of the bride's dress. Hip bustles, however, were undergarments, so it would be odd for a fashion report to note their color. Joyce may instead have in mind a kind of brown flounce sewn onto the outside of the dress below the waist belt, perhaps in something like the manner shown in the first illustration."

  "060017brianboroimhehouse": {
    "note": " Just north of the Crossguns bridge on Prospect Road, the funeral carriages in Hadespass a pub called the \"Brian Boroimhe house,\" named after the great Irish leader Brian Boru who reigned as High King from 1002 to 1014 and whose army defeated the Danes at Clontarf. The mourners are now in the suburb of Glasnevin, home of the Prospect Cemetery, and Bloom thinks, \"Near it now.\" This pub is noteworthy as one of about a dozen mentioned in Ulysses whose doors remain open today, and it is intriguing on other grounds, particularly Joyce's Irish spelling of its name.",
    "expandedNote": " The 1904 issue of Thom's directory listed the owner as \"J. M. Ryan, proprietor and family grocer, tea, wine, and spirit merchant,\" in keeping with the 19th century tradition (now moribund) of \"spirit grocers.\" Today the name over the door of the pub is P. Hedigan, but he is still advertised as a \"wine merchant\" and \"family grocer.\" The name of the pub itself is the Brian Boru, and it always has been. Nevertheless, an old map hanging on a wall in the establishment identifies it as \"The Brian Boroihme House\"—a misspelling of the Irish name Boroimhe. Although at two points in Ithaca the ancient king is referenced by his usual appellation, \"Brian Boru,\" here in Hades his name is rendered in Irish, and with the proper spelling.\n Joyce was eternally attentive to tiny details and also keenly attuned to the suggestive power of names. In a personal communication, Senan Molony suggests that he must have wanted his readers to reflect on the particular, highly unusual form of Brian's name in the funeral chapter. \"Boroimhe,\" he notes, means \"cattle tribute\" (bó = cow, cattle + roimhe= tribute, mortgage payment, tithe). Brian Boru (\"Brian of the Tributes\") must have earned his name by amassing enough power to demand payments of cattle from lesser warriors. In a novel where Stephen is called a \"bullockbefriending bard,\" where Mr. Deasy writes a letter warning about the danger thatfoot and mouth disease poses to Irish cattle herds, where newspapermen attend a meeting of the Irish Cattle Traders and Stockowners Association, and where an entire chapter echoes the warnings of Homer's Odyssey about taking cattle that do not belong to you, the non-standard spelling of Brian's name is surely worth noticing and reflecting on. \n And, indeed, Hades too has been preoccupied with cows. By this point in the chapter, the funeral procession has crossed paths with a consignment of cattle being driven through Dublin's streets to the quays for shipment to England, and Bloom (who once worked at the cattlemarket where Aughrim Street meets the North Circular Road, on the northwest edge of Dublin) has asked why the Corporation doesn't run a tramline from that area to the quays. The map in the Brian Boru shows that the pub once lay only a few blocks from a railway station along the Royal Canal, and only one block from \"The North City Cattle Lairs.\" Presumably cattle arrived at that station from points west and were penned in stockyards quite near the Brian Boru pub, before being driven to the quays. By calling attention to the root meaning of the pub's name, then, Joyce ties it to the export trade in Irish cattle. Ireland's greatest king once exacted tribute in the form of valuable livestock. Now the nation pays the same form of tribute to its Saxon rulers.\n Another possible, but much less compelling, account of the pub's significance has to do with its Christian associations. Brian Boru's forces are said to have camped on the site of the pub on the night before the Battle of Clontarf, and popular mythology holds (with little basis in fact) that the battle represented a victory of Christian Irishmen over pagan invaders. The pub is commonly said to be the only pub in Ireland to display a cross on its front. This is not quite true—the Oarsman in Ringsend, to cite one example, sports a Celtic cross in the tympanum atop its façade—but the pub's exterior does appeal to the popular expectations. A mural high on one wall, probably from the later 20th century, shows Brian holding a sword and a cross-embossed shield against a background of Viking longboats on the waves. A much older painting above the shopfront, probably from the Victorian era, shows him leading his massed troops into battle holding a large crucifix for inspiration.\n The pub's association with militantly xenophobic Christianity is interesting in light of a Dublin rumor, recounted in Rodney Wilson Owen's James Joyce and the Beginnings of Ulysses (1980), that Joyce originally envisioned \"a story about Matthew Kane's funeral in July 1904\" which would center on Alfred Hunter and show \"a post-funeral scene in a pub where the mourners and citizens turn against Hunter\" (8). The Jewish cuckold's ordeal, Owen asserts, involved rejection \"of his claims for Irish citizenship\" (3)—a clear anticipation of the events of Cyclops. But Owen cites no hard evidence for this supposed occurrence, and, if it did happen, a more likely setting would have been Dunphy's, where many funeral parties used to stop after leaving the cemetery, and where Bloom imagines his group will end up. \nMolony points out two other, more telling problems with the theory. First, if Joyce and his father stopped at a pub after Matthew Kane's funeral on 14 July 1904, it could not possibly have been the Brian Boru because, as a poster that also hangs in the pub shows, the house had closed in advance of an auction sale on July 15. Second, it seems highly unlikely that members of a funeral party would ever have behaved so badly to one of their party. Not only would the solemn occasion dictate sober decorum and at least outward displays of christian charity, but giving vent to violent religious bigotry under the influence of alcohol purchased by Kane's family would constitute the worst kind of disrespect."

    "note": " The second part of the chant that opens Oxen of the Sun invokes some god to bless women's wombs with new life: \"Send us bright one, light one, Horhorn, quickening and wombfruit.\" Under one aspect, this deity is simply Dr. Andrew J. Horne, the master of the maternity hospital. But the play on his name to suggest an animal's \"horn,\" and the mentions of \"light,\" pull in the Homeric motif from which this chapter derives its name: cattle sacred to the sun god Helios.",
    "expandedNote": " In Book 12 of the Odyssey, the voyagers are forced to land on an island that they have been warned to avoid, because it contains cattle sacred to Helios (a sun god who later became identified with Apollo), and the god will punish any harm that comes to them. When they run out of food, the men break their vow to Odysseus and slaughter some of the cattle. Helios appeals to Zeus, who destroys the Greek warriors' ship with a lightning bolt when they depart. \n Joyce certainly intended the link between Horne and Helios: the Gilbert schema identifies the Irish doctor as the counterpart of the Homeric god and the nurses in his hospital as analogues to Helios' daughters Phaethusa and Lampetie—facts which Gilbert emphasizes in his James Joyce's Ulysses (1930). But the anger of Homer's god introduces a new element into what so far has been an evocation of human worship and divine benevolence. By killing the sacred oxen, Odysseus' men commit an offense against life. The theme of a god being displeased because men disrespect the fertility that he sanctions will be picked up in the chastising tone of the chapter's fourth paragraph, and in many later sections of the episode.\n In \"Horhorn,\" Jeri Johnson hears instead a play on the expression \"horn of plenty,\" consistent with the idea of \"wombfruit.\""

  "020076brogues": {
    "note": " Nineteenth century \"brogues\" were heavy untanned leather shoes, commonly worn by farmers in Ireland and Scotland. They were designed for working in wet environments like bogs, and often contained rows of perforations to let water run out.",
    "expandedNote": " We learn in Nestor that Mulligan has lent Stephen \"one pair brogues,\" and in Proteus Stephen thinks of the \"borrowed sandals\" on his feet, so it seems very likely that the shoes he is wearing have such perforations. I have not been able to locate any photographs of brogues from Ireland ca. 1900, but a descendant of these rough work shoes survives today in a form of dress shoe, apparently hailing from northern England and lowland Scotland, that retains the perforations in a purely decorative capacity. (See the photo at bottom right.) Scotland also produced a shoe called the ghillie brogue which was open at the top to allow water to drain; it fastened around the ankle to keep the shoe from being pulled off in mud. Dressy forms of this shoe are still worn by bagpipers, and dancers use them in both Scotland and Ireland. (Middle photo.)\n Whatever form of brogue Joyce may be remembering, the references in his novel suggest that he is thinking of traditional rough footwear, rather than the dressy city shoes that evolved from their country cousins in the 20th century. When Cyclops imagines the Citizen as an extravagantly rough \"hero\" from ancient Irish times, the narrative places him in brogues: \"He wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited straw and rushes. Beneath this he wore trews of deerskin, roughly stitched with gut. His nether extremities were encased in high Balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast.\" (Salting is the first, minimal stage in preparing a hide for use as leather.) \n In Oxen of the Sun the same words are applied to Alec Bannon, who has recently returned from the wilds of Mullingar: \"the figure of Bannon in explorer's kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide brogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred manners of Malachi Roland St John Mulligan.\" The parodic styles of this episode make its narrations nearly as unreliable as the parodic sections in Cyclops, but it is evident that Bannon is wearing rough country walking shoes that contrast with Mulligan's urban fashions.\n Twice in Circe, Bloom appears in countryfied outfits. In the first he seems to be an urban gentleman duded up for tramping through the bogs: \"In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel, tony buff shirt, shepherd's plaid Saint Andrew's cross scarftie, white spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in bandolier and a grey billycock hat.\" In the second passage he is an itinerant western peasant, again in brogues: \"In caubeen with clay pipe stuck in the band, dusty brogues, an emigrant's red handkerchief bundle in his hand, leading a black bogoak pig by a sugaun, with a smile in his eye.\" \n Such shoes sometimes appear on the feet of Dubliners, but not ones who are well-off. Circe affords one more example: \"The brothel cook, mrs keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy bib, men's grey and green socks and brogues, floursmeared, a rollingpin stuck with raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the door.\" In Lestrygonians, Bloom thinks of the fishmonger Micky Hanlon as being rich but \"ignorant as a kish of brogues.\" A kish, Gifford notes, is \"a large square basket used for measuring turf,\" suggesting \"that if having one's brains in one's feet means stupidity, how much more stupid a basket full of empty, rough shoes.\" \n Given all these references, it seems certain that the old brogues which Mulligan has handed down to Stephen do not allow the poet to step about the town in style."

  "110009bronzegold": {
    "note": " The overture of musical motifs in Sirens begins very strangely with an amalgamation of four metals: \"Bronze by gold heard the hoofirons, steelyringing.\" The body of the chapter immediately reveals the referents: bronze is the color of \"Miss Douce's head\"; \"Miss Kennedy's head\" is golden; and iron and steel refer to the shoes of horses drawing the viceregal party down the quays, which the two women see going by \"over the crossblind of the Ormond bar,\" where they work. Joyce clearly has a musical purpose in evoking the clatter of horses' hooves, and a visual one in his delineation of hair colors, but bronze and gold may also serve a conceptual purpose, drawing on the splendor of precious metals in Homer'sOdyssey.",
    "expandedNote": " In countless musical instruments, not to mention more utilitarian objects like klaxons, whistles, anvils, hammers, spoons, and oil drums, metals produce pure tones suited to making melody and harmony. But horseshoes don't really ring when they strike pavement; most people would categorize the sound as mere noise, not music. Sirens sets out to complicate this binary. Throughout the chapter rubber bands \"twang\" and \"snap,\" rain and leaves \"murmur,\" garters \"smack,\" shells \"plash\" and \"roar,\" canes \"tap,\" and intestines burble and growl. Bloom thinks, \"Sea, wind, leaves, thunder, waters, cows lowing, the cattlemarket, cocks, hens don't crow, snakes hissss. There's music everywhere. Ruttledge's door: ee creaking. No, that's noise.\" Before capitulating to the conventional wisdom, \"No, that's noise,\" Bloom is onto something: \"There's music everywhere.\" Many professional musicians would agree. In 1979 John Cage composed his remarkable Roaratorio, which sets parts of Finnegans Wake to a music that combines speech, singing, musical instruments, crying babies, street sounds, animal and bird calls, and much more. \n At times in Sirens, repetition of the barmaids' color-tags contributes to lyrical tunecraft: \"Yes, bronze from anear, by gold from afar, heard steel from anear, hoofs ring from afar, and heard steelhoofs ringhoof ringsteel\"; \"Shrill, with deep laughter, after bronze in gold, they urged each each to peal after peal, ringing in changes, bronzegold, goldbronze, shrilldeep, to laughter after laughter.\" But their dominant effect is visual. In the course of hearing them mentioned many dozens of times (\"bronze\" at least 38, \"gold\" at least 26, plus two more times when the pair appear in Wandering Rocks), the reader learns to render them as simply \"the redhead\" and \"the blonde.\" Other colors often figure in descriptions of the two women: \"their blouses, both of black satin\" as they stand behind their \"reef of counter,\" the gold lettering on the mirror behind them, the rose on Miss Douce's chest, the \"cool dim seagreen sliding depth of shadow,eau de Nil\" behind the bar, rendered in the overture as \"oceangreen of shadow.\" (The eau de Nil shade, named for the appearance of Nile river water, is a pale green. Very early in the chapter, Miss Douce has seen the wife of the viceregent pass by in \"pearl grey and eau de Nil.\")\n But after noting all the aural and visual associations that iron, bronze, and gold pick up along the way, readers may still find themselves wondering why Joyce chose to highlight metals in the first place. One possible answer may be found in his intention to have the two barmaids play the Homeric role of sirens, evidenced in their working in seagreen shadow behind a reef and listening to the haunting music inside a seashell. Gifford notes that \"Bronze and gold were the principal metals in the world of Homer's epics; iron was the metal of Homer's own time\" (290). If one accepts his inference, then the awe-inspiring beauty of bronze and gold in the Odyssey informs the allure of the barmaids. They are not simply two young women earning a living and trying to catch the eye of young men, but exotic objects of desire, precious substances.\n Since swords, spears, shields, and armor were fashioned of bronze in the Mycenaean age represented in the Odyssey, one might expect this metal to carry only harsh military resonances, consistent with the themes of war sounded sometimes in Sirens. But Homer treats bronze as an exquisitely decorative substance, gleaming with a light that evokes the celestial dwellings of the gods. In book 4 of the Odyssey, when Telemachus beholds the \"godlike house\" of Menelaus and Helen in Sparta, which \"shone like the dazzling light of sun or moon,\" it is the bronze that first awes him: \"Pisistrarus! Dear friend, do you see how / these echoing halls are shining bright with bronze, / and silver, gold, ivory, and amber? / It is as full of riches as the palace / Of Zeus on Mount Olympus!\" (41-44, 71-75).\n Odysseus has similar responses when he enters the palace of Nausicaa's father Alcinous, the king of the Phaeacians: \"Odysseus approached the royal house, / and stood there by the threshold made of bronze. . . . The palace of the mighty king was high, / and shone like rays of sunlight or of moonlight. / The walls were bronze all over, from the entrance / back to the bedrooms, and along them ran a frieze of blue. Gold doors held safe the house. / Pillars of silver rose up from the threshold, / the lintel silver, and the handle, gold. / Silver and golden dogs stood at each side\" (7.82-92). Golden door handles and silver sculptures contribute to the splendor, but it is bronze that dominates the senses, surpassing the other precious metals with its celestial shining. \n This overpowering brilliance may figure in the passage where, having just daringly exposed her thigh for Boylan's benefit, Lydia is stunned by his sudden departure: \"Miss Douce's brave eyes, unregarded, turned from the crossblind, smitten by sunlight. Gone. Pensive (who knows?), smitten (the smiting light), she lowered the dropblind with a sliding cord. She drew down pensive (why did he go so quick when I?) about her bronze, over the bar where bald stood by sister gold, inexquisite contrast, contrast inexquisite nonexquisite.\" The light here is supplied by the late afternoon sun, not by \"her bronze\" (she is the one who is \"smitten\"), and it is Miss Kennedy beside whose beauty homely bald Pat the waiter offers \"inexquisite contrast.\" But Miss Douce, bathed in radiance, seems to carry some of the splendor described in Odyssey 4 and 7. It is not the first time that bronze and gold have been thus lit up. At the beginning of the chapter Lydia has \"darted, bronze,\" to the window, \"flattening her face against the pane in a halo of hurried breath,\" and Mina has \"sauntered sadly from bright light, twining a loose hair behind an ear. Sauntering sadly, gold no more, she twisted twined a hair.\"\n The ironic contrast between seeing bronze and gold as mere shorthand for hair colors or as manifesting the godlike splendor of a heroic age seems perfectly consonant with Joyce's larger seriocomic purposes in Ulysses."

  "010001buckmulligan": {
    "note": " Ulysses begins with \"Stately, plump Buck Mulligan\" stepping onto the stage afforded by a former military tower and gaily mocking the Catholic faith. Joyce modeled Malachi Mulligan on his one-time friend Oliver St. John Gogarty, a medical student who said in a personal letter that he rented the tower in order to give Joyce a place to live and write.",
    "expandedNote": " Bernard Benstock remarks that the two-word opening \"as a descriptive phrase has a dignity-cum-pomposity befitting the Buck and might well be his own self-descriptiveness at work. In these opening moments, while Mulligan remains alone, narrative tone is maintained close to the character\" (Critical Essays, 2). Ellmann says that Gogarty was “inclined to fat” (117), and we see Mulligan joke about it later in the novel: a companion in Oxen of the Sun asks him if he is perchance pregnant, and \"For answer Mr Mulligan, in a gale of laughter at his smalls, smote himself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable droll mimic of Mother Grogan . . . There's a belly that never bore a bastard.\" The novel's opening phrase, then, exemplifies one prominent aspect of Joyce's prose style: third-person narration that intermittently approximates the subjective mind-set of important characters, a device that various literary critics have called \"free indirect style\" or \"free indirect discourse.\" \n Oliver Gogarty was born in 1878, four years before Joyce. Both belonged to Dublin’s small and precarious Catholic middle class, but Gogarty’s family was much better off. Like his father and grandfather, he became a physician after attending Trinity College, Dublin, the university of the Protestant Ascendancy. Gogarty was a talented athlete, notably in soccer and cycling, but also cricket and swimming, and Joyce incorporates this aspect of the model by referring to Mulligan's \"strong wellknit trunk\" and swimming heroics. \n Gogarty was also a wit in the outrageous style of Oscar Wilde, a self-styled avant-garde aesthete in the same mold, a patriot who befriended the revolutionary leaders Arthur Griffith and Michael Collins, a senator in the Irish Free State after independence, and a writer who befriended many of the literati of the Irish Literary Revival, including William Butler Yeats, George Moore, and George Russell. He produced half a dozen books of poetry, several plays, several impressionistic and essayistic memoirs (As I Was Going Down Sackville Street, Rolling Down the Lea, I Follow Saint Patrick), and various other works while conducting a successful Dublin medical practice as an otolaryngologist.\n Being older, wealthier, and more socially successful than Stephen Dedalus, Mulligan adopts the patronizing view that he knows what is best for his complicated friend and can save him from poverty and despair. Where Stephen sees no hope for advancement or acceptance from the milkwoman (Ireland) or Haines (Britain), Mulligan sets himself forth as a savior: \"From me, Kinch, he said.\" \"I'm the only one that knows what you are,\" he tells Stephen. \"Why don't you trust me more? What have you up your nose against me?\" \n The answer to these questions may not be clear to Mulligan, but it is quite clear to readers of the book: modest financial assistance is no substitute for respect. Mulligan's claim to \"know what you are\" sits ill with his constant urge to disparage and demean his friend. He mocks Stephen's jesuitical training, his artistically portentous name, his appearance, his poverty, his hunger, his bathing habits, his dental hygiene, his mourning dress, his relationship with his mother, his grief, his emotional sensitivity, and even his sanity. Stephen's one real intellectual or artistic accomplishment, the elaborate Shakespeare theory that he will deliver in Scylla and Charybdis, also comes in for mockery. Mulligan praises only one thing in Stephen, the talent that makes him most clownish and most like Buck himself, i.e. his talent as a \"mummer.\" Given this never-ending onslaught of caustic mockery, Stephen's bitter hostility seems quite understandable. And it seems quite likely that he is referring to Mulligan in Circe when he thinks, \"Break my spirit, will he?\"\n The impression one receives of Mulligan through Stephen’s eyes is not flattering, and the book reinforces that view in many ways. He takes the key to the tower even though Stephen has “paid the rent.” He allies himself with Stephen against Haines in Telemachus, but then gossips unkindly about him to Haines in Wandering Rocks. And between Oxen of the Sun and Circe, having drunk up some of Stephen's monthly earnings, at the end of a long day he gives his inebriated companion the slip before jumping on a train back to the southern suburbs with Haines. Simon Dedalus resents his influence on his son (Hades), Leopold Bloom does not like what little he sees of him (Oxen of the Sun), and as Bloom begins to take a paternal interest in Stephen he warns him not to trust Mulligan (Eumaeus).\n This slate of condemnations is counterbalanced by a few positive touches, however. Mulligan has his own relative (“the aunt”) who disapproves of Stephen. (In Oxen of the Sun he says that she is planning to write to Stephen's father: \"Baddybad Stephen lead astray goodygood Malachi.\") Stephen’s having paid the rent (and in life Gogarty did, not Joyce) must be weighed against the fact that he owes Mulligan the substantial sum of “nine pounds” (Nestor). Mulligan has lent Stephen clothing, and proposes giving him more “in a kind voice” (Telemachus). \n Despite the bitter antagonism between these two men, their deft banter in this episode shows a modicum of mutual pleasure and respect. Respect for Gogarty can arguably be inferred from the fact that Joyce gave him such a prominent position in Ulysses. Mulligan’s wild pagan comedy launches this very funny and deeply secular novel, whereas Stephen can manage such comic freedom only in the advanced stages of drink."

The comparisons must be instances of free indirect narration approximating the contents of Stephen's consciousness, because soon after the first of them his interior monologue turns the dog into a deer, using the language of heraldry: \"On a field tenney a buck, trippant, proper, unattired.\" At the end of the chapter, Stephen himself is presented in the language of heraldry.",
    "expandedNote": " In a personal communication, Ole Bønnerup offers the wonderful observation that Stephen's \"buck, trippant\" echoes Mulligan's characterization of himself in Telemachus: \"Tripping and sunny like the buck himself.\" But Stephen manages to map this remembered phrase onto technical terminology. In the language of heraldry, \"passant\" refers to an animal walking past the viewer, looking straight ahead. (If he looks at the viewer, the word \"gardant\" is added.) Unlike other animals, a deer depicted in this posture is called \"trippant.\" Stephen presumably sees the dog moving across his field of vision in this way. He also sees it \"On a field tenney\" (tenné = orange or tawny, i.e. the beach), \"proper\" (in his natural colors, i.e. not changed by demands of iconography), and \"unattired\" (without antlers, i.e., a dog). \n All of this happens in the midst of the narrative's slightly more realistic depiction of the animal. When the hare-dog hears its master calling, it comes back, now sounding vaguely like a horse or deer, and stops at the water's edge to watch more life-forms approaching: \"He turned, bounded back, came nearer, trotted on twinkling shanks. On a field tenny a buck, trippant, proper, unattired. At the lacefringe of the tide he halted with stiff forehoofs, seawardpointed ears. His snout lifted barked at the wavenoise, herds of seamorse. They serpented towards his feet, curling, unfurling many crests, every ninth, breaking.\" \"Seamorse,\" which the OED identifies as an archaic name for a walrus, captures the heaviness of the breaking waves. \"Serpented\" captures their sinuous many-headed advance. \"Every ninth\" foregrounds the human habit of looking for patterns in the fluctuations of magnitude in incoming waves.\n In the following paragraph, the dog becomes a bear: \"The dog yelped running to them, reared up and pawed them, dropping on all fours, again reared up at them with mute bearish fawning.\" And a wolf: \"Unheeded he kept by them as they came towards the drier sand, a rag of wolf's tongue redpanting from his jaws.\" And a cow: \"His speckled body ambled ahead of them and then loped off at a calf's gallop.\" In the paragraph after that, he plays the part of the fox in Stephen's riddle: \"His hindpaws then scattered the sand: then his forepaws dabbled and delved. Something he buried there, his grandmother.\" And finally he leaves in a flurry of changing forms: \"He rooted in the sand, dabbling, delving and stopped to listen to the air, scraped up the sand again with a fury of his claws, soon ceasing, a pard, a panther, got in spousebreach, vulturing the dead.\"\n Thornton traces the leopard and panther to several works in the medieval tradition of fantastic bestiaries. The most relevant seems to be the encyclopedic compendium called De Proprietatibus rerum (On the Properties of Things), written in the 13th century by a Franciscan friar named Bartholomeus Anglicus (Bartholomew the Englishman) and translated into English in the late 14th century by a Cornish writer named John de Trevisa. The OED quotes this sentence from the work: \"Leopardus is a cruel beeste and is gendered in spowsebreche [i.e., adultery] of a parde and of a lionas.\" On the other hand, the \"fury of his claws\" may justify William Schutte's suggestion that Joyce is following Brunetto Latini's Il Tesoro, which explains why the female panther gives birth only once: her young will not wait for the proper time and tear their way out of her womb.\n In the final paragraph of Proteus Stephen himself is described in heraldic terms as he looks back over its shoulder: \"He turned his face over a shoulder, rere regardant.\" In James Joyce and Heraldry (SUNY Press, 1986), Michael J. O'Shea notes that \"None of the English sources to which I have referred uses the expression 'rere regardant' (they simply use 'regardant' to describe the lion looking back over its shoulder) except Barron. But Barron is citing old French usage\" (181). The fact that \"regardant\" was used to describe lions extends the web of connections to still one more animal image: \"The lions couchant on the pillars\" of Mr. Deasy's gateway at the end of Nestor. There, Stephen turns back at the gate and sees the sun fling spangles of light on the \"wise shoulders\" of his Nestor. At the end ofProteus he looks back over his own shoulder to see the masts of a ship evocative of the homecoming of Ulysses."

    "note": " Bloom has seen a Burmese statue of a reclining Buddha in Dublin's National Museum. This lovely marble carving appears to have made a powerful impression on him, and he has taken Molly to see it, lecturing her on how popular Buddhism is in Asia. But his knowledge of east Asian culture is very slight, and the iconographic significance of the statue is lost on him.",
    "expandedNote": " At the beginning of Lotus Eaters Bloom thinks about \"Those Cinghalese lobbing about in the sun in dolce far niente, not doing a hand's turn all day.\" Inside St. Andrew's church he returns to his fanciful speculations about life in the languid Far East, thinking first of Chinese people blissfully stoned on opium and then of the statue: \"Buddha their god lying on his side in the museum. Taking it easy with hand under his cheek. Josssticks burning. Not like Ecce Homo. Crown of thorns and cross.\" He seems to make little differentiation between Ceylon, China, and Burma, and Buddhism, which does have deep roots in each of those countries, impresses him mostly as a spiritual practice that values relaxation instead of the agonizing tortures that inspire Catholic devotions like the Stations of the Cross. \n The contrast has some validity, as far as it goes. But the Buddha is not a \"god,\" and the statue certainly does not depict him \"Taking it easy.\" He was a human being who attained insight into the causes of suffering, and how to overcome it, by dint of nearly superhuman mental concentration. The reclining posture of the statue is entirely consistent with this practice of spiritual discipline. According to tradition, the Buddha ate some tainted pork, knew he was dying, and lay down to await theparinirvana or final release from suffering that death brings to someone who has attained nirvana during life. The pose, then, conveys the spiritual focus of someone leaving the body behind. It is common in the Theravada cultures of countries like Sri Lanka, Burma, Thailand, Malaysia, and Cambodia, with their transcendental emphasis on achieving liberation from the karmic cycle of birth and death, and less so in Mahayana cultures. A proper Christian comparison might be to Jesus' resurrection from death. \n After seeing this marble sculpture in the National Museum, Bloom was so impressed that he came back with Molly in tow. InPenelope she thinks, \"look at the way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he without a hard bolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out all my teeth breathing with his hand on his nose like that Indian god he took me to show one wet Sunday in the museum in Kildare street all yellow in a pinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and Our Lords both put together all over Asia imitating him as hes always imitating everybody I suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big square feet up in his wifes mouth.\" Molly perpetuates the fallacy of the Buddha as a \"god,\" manages to inject yet another country, India, into Bloom's geographical jumble, and reduces the spiritual transport conveyed by the gilded statue into an impression of a man dressed in a yellow \"pinafore\" who might kick out his wife's teeth because he doesn't have enough sense to cover his \"big square feet\" with a blanket.\n The sculpture came to Dublin in 1891 as a result of imperial conquest and pillage. According to John Smurthwaite in \"That Indian God,\" James Joyce Broadsheet 61 (2002): 3, Sir Charles Fitzgerald, an Anglo-Irish colonel in the Indian Army who led a regiment in the campaign to seize and subdue northern Burma starting in 1885, gave the National Museum this marble statue robbed from a Burmese temple. The figure is 1.4 meters long (about 55 inches), and exquisitely executed. Today it is held in the Decorative Arts and History division of theCollins Barracks on Benburb Street, run by the National Museum. Ireland should consider giving it back."

    "note": " Along the rocky coast just a little southeast of the Sandycove tower lie several rocky landmarks that play minor roles in Ulysses: “the Muglins,\" \"Bullock harbour,\" and \"Maiden's rock.\"",
    "expandedNote": " Dalkey Island, not mentioned in the novel, is the largest of several rocky outcroppings off the point where the coast stops slanting southeast from Dublin and takes a more southerly course toward Bray. This island is no longer inhabited but contains the remains of some sparse settlements. The rocky shoals east of Dalkey Island, called the Muglins, pose a significant hazard to shipping, and so have been fitted with a light. As Mulligan, Stephen, and Haines approach the fortyfoot hole in Telemachus, they see \"a sail tacking by the Muglins.\" \n A little later in the same episode, Stephen and Haines approach two men who are observing the sailboat's course: \"— She's making for Bullock harbour,\" a small artificial harbor, constructed from local granite, that lies less than half a mile away from the tower. This harbor cannot accommodate large ships, so the sailing vessel must be of modest size.\n Much later, in Oxen of the Sun, the narrative observes that Theodore Purefoy likes to fish from a boat off the small harbor: \"Her hub fifty odd and a methodist but takes the sacrament and is to be seen any fair sabbath with a pair of his boys off Bullock harbour dapping on the sound with a heavybraked reel or in a punt he has trailing for flounder and pollock and catches a fine bag, I hear.\" \n The two anonymous men who comment on the boat's course in Telemachus also remark on a man who drowned in the ocean nine days earlier: \"The boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain. / — There's five fathoms out there, he said. It'll be swept up that way when the tide comes in about one. It's nine days today.\" Stephen makes the assumption that the sailboat is conducting a search for the body: \"The man that was drowned. A sail veering about the blank bay waiting for a swollen bundle to bob up, roll over to the sun a puffy face, saltwhite. Here I am.\" \n In Proteus, he thinks again about the corpse surfacing, and names the place where he drowned: \"The man that was drowned nine days ago off Maiden's rock. They are waiting for him now.\" Maiden Rock lies just north of Dalkey Island, so the boatman is assuming that the tide will have swept the body far to the north."

    "note": " Ruefully setting off on Deasy's cattle disease business, Stephen thinks that Mulligan will now have yet another mocking nickname for him: \"the bullockbefriending bard.\" But of course it is Stephen who is coining the phrase, and it coheres with other features of his persona, including the mythological associations of his last name, his tastes in philosophy and literature, and, most directly, his connections with his creator.",
    "expandedNote": " Before Dedalus crafted the wings to liberate himself and his son from Crete, he created an artificial cow inside which Pasiphae could satisfy her lust for a prize bull—an adventure which Stephen thinks about in Circe. In A Portrait of the Artist, he is associated with cattle in the opening section (a children's story about a \"moocow\") and much later when some fellow students call him \"Bous.\" \n In addition to these connections within the Joycean textual corpus, Gifford suggests allusions to two important figures in Stephen's intertextual cosmos: Homer and Thomas Aquinas. Homer, he argues, \"befriended\" the cattle of the god Helios by condemning the members of Odysseus' crew who slaughtered the god's cattle—and he was certainly a \"bard.\" Aquinas was called \"the dumb ox\" by his fellow students at Köln. Gifford quotes a remark attributed to his teacher, Albertus Magnus: \"We call him the dumb ox, but he will one day give such a bellow as shall be heard from one end of the world to the other.\"\n But the immediate significance of the phrase lies in Stephen's agreement to deliver Mr. Deasy's letter to two newspaper editors, and in this he is much like James Joyce, who sufficiently sympathized with an acquaintance's concern about foot and mouth disease to write a letter to the editor of an Irish newspaper on the subject."

And, slightly later in the same chapter, Bloom gazes at \"a bucketdredger\" that is \"moored alongside Customhouse quay,\" like the two ships in the photograph at right.\n The bridge was built in 1879, the year that Isaac Butt, a leader of the Home Rule movement, died. It was replaced in the 1930s by a more elegant, but fixed, span."

In Eumaeus Bloom and Stephen stop for a bite to eat and a cup of coffee at another cabman's shelter \"near Butt Bridge,\" where Beresford Place meets the northern quays. The narrative calls it \"an unpretentious wooden structure,\" which certainly describes the building in Tindall's photograph from the 1950s.",
    "expandedNote": " According to Norman Beattie's webpage at www.taxi-l.org, the first cabman's shelter was erected in London in 1875, after an influential newspaper publisher, Sir George Armstrong, sent his servant out on a cold January day to secure a cab. \"The servant was a long time returning because the drivers had all abandoned their cabs and retired to the warmth and conviviality of a local pub.\" Sir George raised funds to build heated shelters nearer the cabstands, and the first one was constructed at the stand nearest his house.\n The idea was soon picked up by \"the Cabmens Shelter Fund, which equipped them with kitchens and employed retired cabbies to operate them. The shelters themselves were usually small green sheds capable of seating about a dozen customers. At their peak there were over 60 of them in London.\" The shelters charged for food and drink, and anyone who wished could come in off the street and order a meal. No alcohol was served, so in addition to their air of being philanthropic enterprises, the shelters could claim to be promoting abstinence. In Eumaeus, Bloom nurses dislike of the shelters, but he concedes that they \"beyond yea or nay did a world of good, shelters such as the present one they were in run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night.\""

  "010055calibanmirror": {
    "note": " Looking at Stephen peering into his cracked mirror, Mulligan exclaims, \"The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror . . . If Wilde were only alive to see you!\" He is alluding to the preface to The Picture of Dorian Gray (1891), where Oscar Wilde defines two great movements in 19th century literature in terms of the reactions of the reading populace: “The nineteenth century dislike of Realism is the rage of Caliban seeing his own face in a glass. / The nineteenth century dislike of Romanticism is the rage of Caliban not seeing his own face in a glass.”",
    "expandedNote": " Wilde’s meaning seems clear enough: the benighted bourgeois are like Caliban, the anti-hero of Shakespeare’s The Tempest—bestially resistant to all civilizing influences. When realistic art accurately imitates them, they are outraged to see themselves represented so unflatteringly. But when romantic art offers an alternative, representing the avant-garde genius of the artist rather than the mediocrity of his audience, they howl in protest at not seeing anything like themselves. \n It is much less clear why Mulligan should compare Stephen to the critics of romantic art, since Stephen himself is a romantic artist. Perhaps he does not intend any exact analogy, but is merely playing with the implicit contrast between external reality and subjective experience: i.e., Stephen is appalled by his appearance in the mirror because it corresponds so poorly to his internal self-conception. If this is the case, then he is stating in his own way what Stephen has already thought about himself, using Robert Burns rather than Wilde as a touchstone: “As he and others see me. Who chose this face for me?”"

  "040000calypso": {
    "note": " Episode 4 begins a new section of the novel, the Wanderings of Ulysses, marked by a Roman numeral II in print editions. Joyce loosely imitated the structure of Homer's Odyssey, which introduces Telemachus before telling the backstory of Odysseus' adventures after the fall of Troy and concluding with the hero's return to Ithaca. But instead of starting in medias res and then looking back, Joyce started June 16 twice, making Leopold Bloom's first three chapters cover the same period of time that Stephen's have, beginning at 8 AM and ending at noon. He also tinkered with Homer's spatial plan, moving his hero from exile to home. \"Calypso\" takes place in and around Bloom's house on Eccles Street, but this title suggested by the schemas implies that all is not well at home.",
    "expandedNote": " Leaving aside all of the questions attendant upon Joyce recasting Odysseus as a socially marginal middle-class ad salesman, it is worth asking why and how he associated Bloom's hour at home with Calypso's island—beyond the obvious reason that this is where Homer starts the story of Odysseus. The fifth book of the Odyssey finds the hero marooned on an island called Ogygia, desperately unhappy and longing to return to Ithaca. He has been away from home for twenty years, seven of them in the company of a demi-goddess who gives him her love, her body, and the promise of immortality, but not the freedom to return home. At the end of the poem he regains his palace and his wife, a conclusion that Joyce reenacted by calling the penultimate chapter of his novel \"Ithaca,\" and the last chapter \"Penelope.\" \n Bloom's narrative begins at home, for the necessary reason that this is where he begins every day. But Joyce conceived the chapter as a reenactment of Odysseus' exile. He did not have to follow Homer's order of events—as the second section of Ulysses goes on, he freely alters that order—so the reader should reflect upon the fact that as Bloom more or less contentedly begins another ordinary day, bringing meat to his house and preparing breakfast, collecting the mail, discussing things with his wife, tending to the needs of his cat, and clearing his bowels and his bladder, he is symbolically presented as a hero in exile. By identifying Molly here with Calypso (as well as Penelope at the end of the novel), Joyce suggests that the Blooms' home is a place of dissatisfaction as much as contentment. \n Athena tells Zeus that her protégé \"lives and grieves upon that island / in thralldom to the nymph.\" When the messenger god Hermes arrives at Calypso's cave, bearing Zeus' command to release her prisoner, Odysseus is not present. He is on the seashore, sitting \"apart, as a thousand times before\":\n The sweet days of his lifetime\n were running out in anguish over his exile, \n for long ago the nymph had ceased to please.\n Though he fought shy of her and her desire,\n he lay with her each night, for she compelled him.\n But when day came he sat on the rocky shore\n and broke his own heart groaning, with eyes wet\n scanning the bare horizon of the sea.\n Molly plays the role of the captor in Calypso. She orders her husband about with sharp commands, as he dutifully labors to fulfill her needs and indulge her whims. She is also the sexual partner who has \"ceased to please,\" and here too Joyce supplies a realistic analogue to Homer's story, though he takes many chapters to supply the details. Since the death of their second child, more than ten years earlier, the Blooms have not enjoyed satisfying sexual intercourse, and the disinterest is pretty clearly Bloom's. \n Many other details link Molly with Calypso. Homer calls his goddess \"the softly-braided nymph,\" and Molly lies in bed \"counting the strands of her hair, smiling, braiding.\" Over the Blooms' bed hangs a reproduction of a painting titledThe Bath of the Nymph, which Bloom thinks is \"Not unlike her with her hair down: slimmer.\" He remembers how it came to hang there: \"She said it would look nice over the bed.\" A passage in the Odyssey describing the scented smoke in Calypso's cave may have inspired Bloom's appreciation for the scents of tea and cooking food in Molly's presence. And the name Calypso means \"Concealer.\" When Bloom delivers a letter to his wife, she hides it under the pillow. It is from the man that she will begin an affair with on this day—a great concealment.\n Molly does not bother to effectively conceal either the hiding of the letter or the affair from her husband, but these brazen actions express her alienation from him. Bloom too feels alienated. He spends much of his day thinking about other women, beginning in this chapter with the neighbors' servant girl. Although he is not conducting any physical affairs, he has visited prostitutes, and June 16 finds him engaged in an epistolary affair. It is probably not his first. His marked subservience to his wife coheres with a strongly masochistic tendency in his sexuality, an excessive deference to other men that suggests insufficient self-confidence, a willingness to imagine other men having sex with his wife, and an interest in Greek goddesses as immortal ideals of physical beauty who do not have to live with physical frailty.\n Bloom likes his place in the world, his home with Molly. The \"art\" of the fourth chapter, according to Gilbert's schema, is \"economics,\" which in its original Greek sense means household management, and this term describes Bloom's life as a househusband as we see him puttering about in Calypso. But the home, for him, is a place of entrapment as well as self-fulfillment, and when the chapter ends he makes his way out into the larger world. The travels that he undertakes on June 16, thinking constantly of the sad state of his marriage, push him out of his comfortable center and bring him back to it at the end of the day. It is perhaps not too ingenious to see in Boylan's letter an echo of Hermes' message from Zeus, freeing Odysseus to leave. It will be a long time, actually and textually, before this traveler returns. \n Like Telemachus, Calypso begins near the hour of 8:00 and ends at 8:45. It takes place at the northern edge of Dublin, in a house located just inside the North Circular Road and on nearby city streets."

  "020013candescent": {
    "note": " In Nestor and again in Proteus, Stephen thinks of the human soul as the \"form of forms,\" capable of containing the intelligible essences of everything in the world. This thought is inspired by Aristotle's chief psychological work, De Anima (On the Soul), with some help from his Metaphysics.",
    "expandedNote": " In Nestor Stephen has been thinking of his \"mind's darkness\" as something hidden, \"reluctant, shy of brightness,\" but suddenly, inspired perhaps by the \"glowlamps\" within the cavernous gloom of the St. Geneviève reading room, he shifts to metaphors of light: \"Thought is the thought of thought. Tranquil brightness. The soul is in a manner all that is: the soul is the form of forms. Tranquility sudden, vast, candescent: form of forms.\" \n In an important passage of On the Soul, Aristotle uses light as a metaphor for an aspect of Mind that is eternally active and perfectly capacious. He has been applying his theory of potentiality and actuality to the various forms of sensation and thought. Human thought, he says, must be understood as something that emerges from possible into active existence. The material from which thought is formed—the \"potential,\" \"possible,\" or \"passive\" component of thought—seems to derive in some way from sensory impressions. But what \"actual\" force, or \"activity,\" or \"agent,\" works upon the materials of sensation to produce ideas? \n Aristotle addresses the question very briefly and metaphorically, saying that \"Mind in the passive sense is such because it becomes all things, but mind has another aspect in that it makes all things; this is a kind of positive state like light; for in a sense light makes potential into actual colours. Mind in this sense is separable, impassive and unmixed, since it is essentially an activity; for the agent is always superior to the patient, and the originating cause to the matter. . . . Mind does not think intermittently. When isolated it is its true self and nothing more, and this alone is immortal and everlasting (we do not remember because, while mind in this sense cannot be acted upon, mind in the passive sense is perishable), and without this nothing thinks\" (430a15-25, trans. W.S. Hett).\n The active intellect, then, is \"immortal,\" unlike other parts of the human mind. It is \"separable\" from matter, \"unmixed\" with anything else. Some commentators, Stephen among them, associate its unceasing and pure intellectual activity with a description of the divine mind that Aristotle ventures in the Metaphysics. The Prime Mover, he says there, is thought thinking itself, and Stephen echoes this definition: \"Thought is the thought of thought.\" The divine or godlike force called the active intellect acts upon human brains to produce thought in them, so moments of penetrating insight can be thought of as \"Tranquil brightness . . . sudden, vast, candescent.\"\n Stephen's thought that \"the soul is the form of forms\" reflects Aristotle's analysis, in On the Soul, of how the human mind actualizes the forms of various intelligible objects within itself. The soul (psyche) is the \"form\" of the body. Sensation is one form that that form takes, by receiving and processing the sensible forms of objects in the external world. Objects also have intelligible forms and the rational soul can assimilate these forms as well, so that the soul (potentially, temporarily, in the act of thinking) \"becomes all things.\" Stephen seems to be combining this epistemological analysis with the metaphysical language devoted to the active intellect to draw the conclusion that \"The soul is in a manner all that is.\" Like the vast mind called the Prime Mover, in which all things are endlessly contemplated, the human mind can contain all of reality. \n The relevance of this speculation, in the mind of the would-be artist, to an epic and encyclopedic literary work like Ulysses is obvious. In A Portrait of the Artist Stephen used a few phrases culled from Thomas Aquinas to articulate three qualities of the \"esthetic image.\" In Ulysses he goes back to Aquinas' inspiration, Aristotle, to think about how the artistic mind, and by extension its literary offspring, can encompass everything.\n The active intellect was the subject of intense speculation in medieval philosophy, among those who sought to combine Aristotelianism and monotheistic faith. Aquinas defined it as a power within the individual psyche, because he believed in an individual soul that was God-created, God-like, and immortal. But Aristotle did not believe in the survival of the individual mind. He says that the active intellect is \"immortal and everlasting,\" but those very qualities distinguish it from everything organic. \"When isolated it is its true self and nothing more\": it exists apart from human beings, acts upon their minds to produce thought in them, and survives when they perish. It seems to be some kind of transcendent force, perpetually active, and not an \"intermittently\" active human faculty. Early Peripatetic and Neoplatonic commentators, some medieval Arabs and Jews like Avicenna, Averroes, and Moses Maimonides, and some medieval Christians as well, responded more perceptively to this aspect of Aristotle's psychology than Aquinas did. They identified the \"active\" Mind variously as God, or a divine emanation, or a universal mind or soul."

The fact that Bloom thinks of it in Lotus Eaters as a \"temperance beverage\" suggests that it was commonly consumed by itself, rather than used as a mixer. The name \"ginger ale,\" coined in the mid-19th century, likewise points to its origins as an alternative to alcoholic drinks.",
    "expandedNote": " Thomas Joseph Cantrell (1827-1909) was born in Dublin and worked at a Belfast firm of chemists and soda water manufacturers called Grattan & Co. that marketed the first carbonated ginger ale. Cantrell formed the first of his own businesses, Dyas & Cantrell, in Belfast in 1852. In 1868 he merged his business with the soft drinks business of Henry Cochrane (1836-1904) to form Cantrell & Cochrane. By dint of acquiring a water company, using a chemical preservative to retard spoilage, and aggressively advertising with posters, the company became the largest manufacturer of soft drinks in the world by the 1880s, with large plants in Dublin and Belfast. In 1901 it received a royal warrant from the new king, Edward VII. \n In Lotus Eaters Bloom stands on the corner of Westland Row and Great Brunswick Street and sees a Cantrell & Cochrane's poster among \"the multicoloured hoardings\" adorning a wall at that busy intersection. Later in the chapter he thinks about the use of wine in the Communion service: \"The priest was rinsing out the chalice: then he tossed off the dregs smartly. Wine. Makes it more aristocratic than for example if he drank what they are used to Guinness’s porter or some temperance beverage Wheatley’s Dublin hop bitters or Cantrell and Cochrane’s ginger ale (aromatic). Doesn’t give them any of it: shew wine: only the other. Cold comfort. Pious fraud but quite right: otherwise they’d have one old booser worse than another coming along, cadging for a drink.\"\n Sirens spotlights an advertising gambit still popular in bars today, when Miss Douce, tending bar, turns toward the bottles grouped around a showy mirror: \"With grace of alacrity towards the mirror gilt Cantrell and Cochrane’s she turned herself. With grace she tapped a measure of gold whisky from her crystal keg.\" With a typical fidelity to Joyce's text, Richard Hamilton has captured part of such a mirror in his well-known image of Miss Douce and Miss Kennedy grasping beer-pulls behind the bar."

    "note": " Bloom's list of literary travelers who, like Odysseus, come home after decades away (Alice Ben Bolt, Enoch Arden, Rip van Winkle) concludes with one Irish example: \"does anybody hereabouts remember Caoc O'Leary, a favourite and most trying declamation piece.\" The work he refers to is Caoch O'Leary, often called Caoch the Piper. A simple and tenderhearted tale by County Laois poet John Keegan, it was assigned reading in primary schools for years, and is often recited even today. Judging by his description of it as \"most trying,\" Bloom seems to have been forced to memorize at least some of it in his youth.",
    "expandedNote": " First published in May 1846 in The Irish National Magazine, Keegan's ballad tells the story of a blind piper (caoch means \"blind\" or \"one-eyed\") who wanders to the door of a boy's house in the countryside with his dog Pinch. Seeking shelter for the night, he finds a warm welcome, plays his pipes for the family the next morning, bonds with the boy, and departs. Twenty years later, the grown-up speaker of the poem has lost the \"happy times\" of his childhood and all of his loved ones. Sitting at his door thinking \"Of twenty sad things,\" he sees a little dog wearily leading a decrepit figure up the lane. The old man asks, \"Does anybody hereabouts / Remember Caoch the piper?\" The two lonely men embrace tearily and the piper asks to spends one more night in the house, saying \"I'll go home tomorrow\": \"My peace is made, I'll calmly leave / This world so cold and dreary; / And you shall keep my pipes and dog, / And pray for Caoch O'Leary.\" In the morning neighbors help the speaker dig a grave \"near Eily, Kate, and Mary,\" and now the old piper \"sleeps his last sweet sleep.\" \n Joyce ingeniously spotted the structural affinities between this simple ballad and Homer's Odyssey: a 20-year absence (amazingly, he found the same Homeric span in Ben Bolt and Rip van Winkle), a homecoming, a joyful father-son reunion, an old faithful dog. Also worth admiring is the way Bloom seems to be asking his companions in the cabman's shelter a question (Do any of you remember that old chestnut we had to memorize in school?), when in fact he is silently quoting from the poem. The phrase \"Does anybody hereabouts remember\" encapsulates the pathos of the old exile forgotten by the world, which is Bloom's focus in all four stories. Later in Eumaeus he will pull Charles Stewart Parnell into the same orbit.\n John Keegan too has been largely forgotten. He lived a peasant's life, educated in his youth by tutors who wandered the countryside like the piper, and he died of cholera in 1849 in his thirties, having suffered through the famine years with few resources. During his short years he achieved a sizeable body of journalistic and poetic work. Caoch the Piper, his best known poem, is much more widely recognized than he is. In fact Bloom is made to participate in the erasure of the poet: he supposes that the work was written by \"poor John Casey.\" \n In recent years, though, efforts have been made to resuscitate Keegan's reputation. An 11 March 1999 article in the Irish Times notes that Tony Delaney, who was born in the same Midlands parish, edited and published his Selected Works (Galmoy Press, 1997), located his unmarked grave in the Glasnevin cemetery, and headed up efforts to have a \"monumental sculptor\" erect a Celtic cross over it."

  "040043capelstreet": {
    "note": " Molly's request for another Paul de Kock book makes Bloom think, \"Must get that Capel street library book renewed or they'll write to Kearney, my guarantor.\" The public library on Capel (pronounced KAY-pəl) Street, one of the first two in the city's history, was approaching its twentieth anniversary at the time represented in the novel. Bloom has secured the backing of a nearby businessman to obtain borrowing privileges, which were not extended to just anyone. The library is mentioned also in Wandering Rocks (Miss Dunne has borrowed a Wilkie Collins novel), Ithaca (Bloom has borrowed an Arthur Conan Doyle book for himself), and Eumaeus. The street itself surfaces in characters' thoughts in Cyclops and Nausicaa.",
    "expandedNote": " From a point in the very center of Dublin, the largely commercial Capel Street runs northward from the River Liffey for a little over a third of a mile, ending near the southern terminus of Dorset Street. It is easy to imagine Bloom walking half a mile down one of his favorite shopping streets and turning into Capel to borrow books. Gifford notes that a book and music seller named Joseph Kearney had a Capel Street shop across the street from the library, but his address for the library is mistaken (it was at 106, not 166), so Kearney's shop would actually have been several blocks away.\n Many lending libraries in Ireland, and around the world, still require young people to have an adult \"guarantor\" in order to receive a borrowing card, but it would be unusual today to require that of someone over 18 years of age. Bloom's need to have a local businessman co-sign his borrower's application reflects the pervasive poverty in 1904 Dublin, where financial solvency could be expected of only a small percentage of the population. In his foreword to Joseph O'Brien's Dear, Dirty Dublin (1982), Hugh Kenner observes that \"by 1908 when shortage of funds closed the entire system down only 6,000 books were on loan to about that many cardholders\" (ix). The libraries had to impose stringent terms to keep their books from disappearing or being damaged. The notice from the Lending Department reproduced alongside this note specifies that \"Application will be made to the Borrower for the return or value of the Book, if the same be not promptly returned; and in case of refusal or neglect, proceedings will be taken to recover the same.\" If a borrower does not agree to pay for damages caused to a book, \"application will be made to the Guarantor.\"\n The Public Libraries Act of 1855 allowed for the establishment of free public lending libraries in Dublin, but the Corporation did not form a committee to do so until 1883. Two run-down Georgian tenement houses in Capel Street and Thomas Street were obtained for the purpose, to serve the north and south sides of the city respectively, and they opened within hours of each other on 1 October 1884.\n The Dublin City Council website, from which two of the photographs on this page are taken, notes what a momentous development in the life of the city this was: \"To mark the occasion, the Library Association of the United Kingdom held its Annual Conference in Dublin for the first and only time. Conference delegates attended the opening ceremony. Patrick Grogan, formerly a librarian at Maynooth College, became the first librarian at Capel Street. The staff was composed of a librarian, three library assistants, and a hall porter. The Capel Street library proved popular with the inhabitants of what was then a heavily industrialised area of the city. A newsroom had to be constructed at the rear of the building to accommodate 400 readers. A Ladies Reading Room was opened on 24 May 1895 and attracted a monthly attendance of 780. The daily average of books issued in 1901 was almost 300 volumes. In 1902 the daily average attendance in the newsroom was 1,200.\"\n Bloom's ability to take books home for two weeks, rather than having to look at them in a crowded reading room, marks him as a relatively prosperous and privileged member of Dublin society."

  "050015thecard": {
    "note": " The nameless \"White slip of paper\" that Bloom checks in Calypso, to make sure that it is \"Quite safe\" inside the leather sweatband of his hat, figures more prominently in Lotus Eaters. There, it turns out to be not really a slip of paper but rather a \"card\"—what Victorians and Edwardians called a \"calling card\" or \"visiting card,\" the equivalent of our \"business cards\" today. Bloom presents it at the post office to collect poste restante mail from his erotic pen pal Martha Clifford, under a pseudonym. Before entering the post office, in a performance calculated to remove any suspicion about his clandestine correspondence he moves the card from his hat to a pocket of his vest. It is one of several moments in the book when Bloomsees himself as others might and takes ingenious and probably excessive precautions to hide his intentions from them.",
    "expandedNote": " The first-time reader of Calypso cannot know what to make of the paper, other than to note that Bloom thinks he has hidden something well. Lotus Eaters reveals the card's true nature when Bloom hands it \"through the brass grill\" of the post office window, asking \"Are there any letters for me?\" When he reads the envelope that is handed to him, it becomes clear that he carries in his hat a card bearing the name \"Henry Flower, Esq.\" The calling cards of the day sometimes bore simply the person's name, and sometimes added an address. Henry lists his address as the Westland Row post office box. \n Bloom, then, has invented a respectable alias to cover his epistolary affair; he has set up a postbox for the fictive Henry at a site far removed from his own neighborhood; and he has apparently had cards printed to avoid having to pronounce the name Henry Flower in a public setting where someone who knows that he is not Henry might hear him saying it. To make even more sure that he will not be detected, before entering the post office he checks to see that there is no one but the postmistress in the lobby: \"From the curbstone he darted a keen glance through the door of the postoffice. Too late box. Post here. No-one. In.\"\n Nor is that the end of his Odyssean cunning. While he is still across the road from the post office he enacts an elaborate charade to move the card, by sleight of hand, to a place that a respectable gentleman might keep such an item: \"he took off his hat quietly inhaling his hairoil and sent his right hand with slow grace over his brow and hair. Very warm morning. Under their dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow of the leather headband inside his high grade ha. Just there. His right hand came down into the bowl of his hat. His fingers found quickly a card behind the headband and transferred it to his waistcoat pocket.\" Once more he thinks, \"So warm,\" and (in a Gabler textual emendation that makes much better sense of the following sentences and is adopted on this website) he once more passes his hand over his brow and hair and returns the hat to its rightful place. \n Of this remarkable performance, Peter Kuch writes in Irish Divorce: Joyce's Ulysses (Palgrave Macmillian, 2017) that \"It is now eleven o'clock, and it is warm but not hot. But by pretending it is 'rather warm,' Bloom devises a sequence of gestures that will conceal what he is actually doing—that is, transferring the card from his hat to his waistcoat. All his gestures become self-consciously choreographed. . . . What had been a quick and somewhat furtive action before breakfast has become, barely an hour later, a subterfuge that is as complex as it is self-consciously orchestrated, performed meticulously as it were before a wholly imagined audience\" (75).\n A smaller but very similar charade in Lestrygonians shows Bloom disguising his intentions not to preserve his sexual reputation but to guard against offending others. In their defensiveness both passages seem to anticipate the hallucinations of Circe, where Bloom is repeatedly accused of doing shameful things."

  "040039cascara": {
    "note": " Joyce's realistic depiction of Bloom's bowel movement in Calypso includes one vividly personal detail: an ongoing struggle with \"constipation.\" He credits his deliverance from this ailment on June 16 to consumption of a popular herbal laxative, \"cascara sagrada.\"",
    "expandedNote": " As he sits reading Philip Beaufoy's story in Tit-Bits, Bloom holds back, \"yielding but resisting.\" Halfway through the story, \"his last resistance yielding, he allowed his bowels to ease themselves quietly as he read, reading still patiently, that slight constipation of yesterday quite gone. Hope it's not too big bring on piles again. No, just right. So. Ah! Costive. One tabloid of cascara sagrada.\" \"Costive\" is a less familiar form of \"constipated,\" derived ultimately from the same Latin root. The placement of the word in Bloom's thoughts suggests that he may be recalling language from an advertisement or from the label on a bottle of pills.\n Cascara sagrada, Spanish for \"sacred bark,\" refers to the dried and pulverized bark of an understory buckthorn tree, Rhamnus purshiana, that is native to the northwestern United States and British Columbia. Chemicals in the bark stimulate peristalsis very effectively by increasing water retention in the colon, a fact which Native American tribes in the area have exploited for centuries. Spaniards exploring the area in the 1600s tried it for themselves and bestowed the honorific name. An American pharmaceutical company, Parke-Davis, began marketing the powdered bark in the 1870s and was soon exporting it to Europe. It was extremely popular in the early 20th century and remains so today, though the US Food and Drug Administration in 2002 banned its use in over-the-counter laxatives.\n The properties of this herbal laxative fit well with Joyce's account of Bloom's peristalsis, but he adds one puzzling detail: \"that slight constipation of yesterday quite gone. Hope it's not too big bring on piles again.\" Piles are hemorrhoids, but what is \"it\"? Although hemorrhoids can be caused by straining to overcome \"constipation,\" this can hardly be the reference, since Bloom is reflecting on the fact that it is \"quite gone.\" Another possibilility is the dosage of cascara sagrada (\"one tabloid\") he has taken: because of its potentially violent effects, the drug is contraindicated for people with hemorrhoids. But the most likely explanation is the bowel movement itself. If the laxative voids his bowels too massively, the delicate blood vessels in his lower rectum and anus may suffer."

  "020058cassandra": {
    "note": " The bits of Deasy's letter that we receive through Stephen's interior monologue are sometimes easily intelligible, sometimes elusive. The point of his \"Pardoned . . . classical allusion\" (sorry, it's a way we learned schoolmasters have) to \"Cassandra\" seems obvious enough: Deasy is a prophet whom no one heeds. But who is the \"woman who\nwas no better than she should be,\" and why is Deasy misogynistically commenting on her virtue?",
    "expandedNote": " Cassandra was a Trojan princess, daughter of King Priam and Queen Hecuba, whose beauty inspired Apollo to give her the power of prophecy. But when she refused to reciprocate his love he added the curse of having no one believe her predictions. She foresaw the downfall of Troy, which the Trojans might have prevented had they listened to her. Similarly, Deasy is predicting the downfall of the Irish economy if FMD becomes established in the island, but no one will listen to his warnings. \n It seems unlikely that Cassandra is the woman \"who was no better than she should be\": she refused to fornicate with the god, and her sexual relations after the fall of Troy (first with Ajax, then with Agamemnon) were coerced. A little later in the episode, we learn from Deasy's verbatim repetition of the phrase that he is referring to \"Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus.\" What is she doing in the letter? Apparently it contains digressions within digressions.\n [2014] Thornton notes that \"a woman who is no better than she should be\" is a proverbial saying going back as far as 1604. He cites several instances."

  "030007catalectic": {
    "note": " Listening to the sound his feet are making (\"Crush, crack, crick, crick\"), the poet in Stephen recalls a familiar fragment of verse and thinks, \"Rhythm begins, you see. I hear. A catalectic tetrameter of iambs marching.\" Derived from a Greek word meaning \"incomplete,\" a catalectic line of verse is one missing a syllable from the expected structure, in this case iambic tetrameter (dee DUM dee DUM dee DUM dee DUM).",
    "expandedNote": " The omission usually occurs at the end of a line, but if \"Won't you come to Sandymount\" (DUM dee DUM dee DUM dee DUM) is scanned as iambic tetrameter the syllable is missing from the beginning—as if chopped from \"O, won't you come to Sandymount.\" As Stephen continues to brood on the fragment of verse, he chops yet another syllable off the beginning of the second line, to sound out two perfect iambs: \"deline the mare.\" \n Stephen's line could be scanned as trochaic tetrameter (DUM dee DUM dee DUM dee DUM dee), in which case the truncated foot would come at the end. In the Keats poem reproduced here, the first and last lines are catalectic trochaic tetrameter, with the missing final syllable marked by a caret. (The second and fifth lines are regular, or \"acatalectic,\" iambic tetrameter, and the middle lines are regular trochaic tetrameter.) \"Give me women, wine, and snuff\" sounds metrically indistinguishable from \"Won't you come to Sandymount,\" so perhaps Stephen should be thinking of a catalectic tetrameter of trochees marching. But if Keats' second line were truncated to read \"Till I cry out, 'Hold, enough!',\" that iambic line would suddenly become catalectic, and sound much the same as the first and sixth. The difference is academic, then—best left to professional prosodists with too much time on their hands.\n One thing that the line is certainly not, however, is acatalectic. The 1984 edition of Ulysses by Hans Walter Gabler contains some strange reversals of past editorial practice, one of the most bizarre and indefensible of which is the alteration of \"A catalectic\" to \"Acatalectic.\" Joyce's handwriting in the Rosenbach manuscript might or might not be read as containing a space, but neither the first edition nor any of the corrected texts in the 1930s inserted one. And while prosodists might argue about whether the lines Stephen quotes are catalectic iambic or catalectic trochaic verse, in no rational universe could they ever be called acatalectic, i.e. metrically regular."

  "060013catholicclub": {
    "note": " O'Connell Street has seen unending change since 1904. Of all the Georgian townhouses that once lined its Upper section, only one remains standing today: the \"catholic club\" that Bloom sees on the \"Dead side of the street\" (personal communication from Gareth Collins).",
    "expandedNote": " The building at 42 Upper Sackville Street was built in 1757. In 1882 an institution called the Catholic Commercial Club was founded, and took up residence in the townhouse. It was a gentlemen's club for supporters of the Irish Parliamentary Party (Parnell's Home Rule party), frequented by members of the Catholic middle classes who felt themselves rising in the world. The club shut down in 1954.\n Gifford identifies the other allusions in this long string of sights: \"In the nineteenth century land agents were important in the management of Irish landlords' (many of them absentee) large land holdings. A succession of land reforms in the late nineteenth century, climaxing in 1903, dismantled these estates and displaced the land agents as a class.\" The \"temperance hotel\" that Bloom thinks of next was \"The Edinburgh Temperance Hotel, 56 Sackville Street Upper.\" \"Falconer's railway guide,\" at number 53, refers to \"John Falconer, printer, publisher, wholesale stationer, depot for the sale of Irish national school books; office of the Irish Law Times, the Solicitor's Journal, and the ABC Railway Guide.\" The \"civil service college,\" at number 51, was \"Maguire's Civil Service College (a tutoring school for the British civil-service examinations).\" \"Gill's,\" at number 50, was \"M. H. Gill & Son, Ltd., wholesale and retail booksellers, publishers, printers, and bookbinders, depot for religious goods.\" And \"the industrious blind,\" at number 41, was the \"Richmond National Institution for the Instruction of the Industrious Blind.\" \n This is indeed \"Dull business by day.\" O'Connell Street Upper is not the showcase of national pride and magnet of commercial activity that O'Connell Street Lower is."

  "040037cattlemarket": {
    "note": " Ulysses makes many references to the \"cattlemarket\" that for about a century stood at the intersection of the North Circular Road and Prussia Street. Bloom once worked there for a cattle trader named \"Joseph Cuffe,\" who fired him for being too opinionated with a rancher. One of Bloom's strongly held opinions is that the Corporation should build a tram line from the market to the Liffey, so that cattle could be transported by train to the quays rather than driving them through the city streets.",
    "expandedNote": " The Dublin Cattle Market, established in 1863 to replace an older facility in nearby Smithfield, had open-air, metal-railed pens set in concrete foundations to accommodate several thousand cattle and many more thousands of sheep, with walkways for buyers to view the stock before bidding. It was a large and well-designed operation, making it possible for animals from far-flung parts of Ireland to be brought to a centralized market by railcar. Competitive bidding allowed ranchers to get decent prices, and also established prices for sales at fairs throughout Ireland, in the manner of a commodities exchange. Export sales far outweighed purchases for domestic slaughter. At its peak in the 1950s, according to FarmIreland.ie, more than one million live animals (cattle, sheep, and pigs) were annually exported from Dublin after being bought at the weekly Wednesday morning sale. It was the largest such market in Europe.\n In Calypso Bloom thinks of \"Those mornings in the cattlemarket, the beasts lowing in their pens, branded sheep, flop and fall of dung, the breeders in hobnailed boots trudging through the litter, slapping a palm on a ripemeated hindquarter, there's a prime one, unpeeled switches in their hands.\" In Hades he thinks that \"Tomorrow is killing day,\" but reflects that the cattle he is seeing in the streets are bound for foreign markets. There was a slaughterhouse on the grounds of the market, as he remembers in Lestrygonians: \"Wretched brutes there at the cattlemarket waiting for the poleaxe to split their skulls open.\"\n Ithaca notes that \"during parts of the years 1893 and 1894\" the Blooms were living in the City Arms Hotel because Bloom was working as a clerk at the nearby cattle market. (The hotel was also a popular choice for foreign buyers visiting the market.) The narrator of Cyclops knows about Bloom's job as a sales clerk (\"he was up one time in a knacker's yard. Walking about with his book and pencil\"), and about his dismissal (\"Joe Cuffe gave him the order of the boot for giving lip to a grazier\"). Molly thinks that this was one of four good jobs that her husband has screwed up, and imagines that \"he could have been in Mr Cuffes still only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up I could have got him promoted there to be the manager.\" Her appeal to reinstate her husband was unsuccessful.\n Calypso mentions, and Circe repeats, Bloom's scheme to run \"a tramline along the North Circular from the cattlemarket to the quays\" on the River Liffey, and Ithaca describes the plan in great detail. Bloom has thought about how track could be laid alongside existing rail lines on the North Circular Road, how the new line could link up with various railroad, shipping, and storage facilities, how it could promote international trade in Irish beef, and how the project could be funded. Assuming that his calculations are practicable, the idea does seem better than driving herds of cattle through the streets of a metropolis—a practice which continued unabated until the closing of the Dublin Cattle Market in 1973. Cattle and sheep marched several abreast in lines that could be half a mile long, with local drovers and dogs occasionally separating them to let trams through.\n The market itself was the product of innovative urban planning. In \"The Dublin Cattle Market,\" published in Dublin Historical Record 55 (2002): 166-80, Liam Clare observes that it was designed to replace \"the small, miserable, narrow, insanitary, unhealthy and exposed market area at Smithfield, where tired cattle and footsore sheep were cruelly forced through crowded streets; a spot where existing salesmasters monopolised the public market space to the exclusion of competition; a location requiring cattle for export to be driven down the north quays to the docks. In contrast, the new market would be spacious, paved, drained and supplied with ample water. There would be free access for both producers and salesmasters from Smithfield, subject to payment of a small fee. Most of the cattle would arrive directly at the market by rail from the most important grazing areas to the west and north of the city, via the Midland Great Western Railway Company's proposed railhead at the docks, or via the Great Northern Railway. A proposed underground rail link, the Phoenix Park tunnel, would carry stock from the south and south-west. Only the cattle from the south-east would lack convenient access to the new market. The animals, when sold for export, would already be close to the embarkation point, or they could be slaughtered at their proposed new abattoir, clean and convenient, in contrast with the city's existing objectionable slaughterhouses\" (167)."

  "110003chambermusic": {
    "note": " In Sirens Bloom thinks, \"Chamber music. Could make a kind of pun on that. It is a kind of music I often thought when she. Acoustics that is. Tinkling. Empty vessels make most noise.\" \"It\" is the sound of bodily fluids resonating in a chamber pot. The pun was implicit in the metaphorical title of Joyce's first book-length publication, a collection of 36 short lyric poems written from 1901 to 1906.",
    "expandedNote": " Chamber music is simply classical music with a small number of parts and one performer to a part. The term usually refers to instrumental genres like the string quartet, but it might as justly be applied to the Elizabethan lute songs that Joyce was enamored of in his early 20s. These delicate compositions bear more than a passing resemblance to Joyce's early lyric poems—resonant mood pieces that, although far removed from the rhythms of speech, require attention to each word, much as lute songs highlight each syllable in the voice and each quaver in the responsive instrument. \n Joyce's brother Stanislaus noticed the resemblance between his poems and chamber music, and suggested the metaphorical title. A chance incident suggested the additional scatological pun. Ellmann relates the event: \"Gogarty, who was then in Dublin, had brought Joyce to visit Jenny, an easy-going widow, and while they all drank porter Joyce read out his poems, which he carried with him in a large packet, each written in his best hand in the middle of a large piece of parchment. The widow was pleased enough by this entertainment, but had to interrupt to withdraw behind a screen to a chamber pot. As the two young men listened, Gogarty cried out, 'There's a critic for you!' Joyce had already accepted the title of Chamber Music which Stanislaus had suggested; and when Stanislaus heard the story from him, he remarked, 'You can take it as a favorable omen'\" (154). Joyce did.\n Few people would associate a countertenor plaining to his lute with a woman pissing into a ceramic pot, but in Joyce's imagination the connection became almost inevitable. Even in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, where spirituality and physicality are not fused so dramatically as in Ulysses, Stephen's thoughts run the ethereal-carnal gamut: \"His mind, when wearied of its search for the essence of beauty amid the spectral words of Aristotle or Aquinas, turned often for its pleasure to the dainty songs of the Elizabethans. His mind, in the vesture of a doubting monk, stood often in shadow under the windows of that age, to hear the grave and mocking music of the lutenists or the frank laughter of waistcoateers [prostitutes] until a laugh too low, a phrase, tarnished by time, of chambering [fornication] and false honour, stung his monkish pride and drove him on from his lurkingplace.\" \n Some readers may recall that the best-known of these delicate songs, \"Greensleeves,\" concerns \"chambering\" in this sexual sense of frequenting women's bedrooms and their vaginas: it makes its complaint to a woman who accepted all the singer's rich gifts in return for sexual favors, and then left him. The John Dowland song attached here effects a similar linkage between Petrarchan adoration and carnal knowledge: the repeated words \"come\" and \"die\" both contain strong sexual meanings.\n Joyce was not content simply to have Bloom state the connection between dainty music and women's genitals. In Penelope he staged a performance on the chamber pot and insinuated a reference to the musical effects of poetry, bringing the scatalogical implications of his poetic title to life. When Molly's period comes on her and she sits on the pot that the Blooms keep beside their bed, the sounds make her think of a lyric poem that rings with countless rhymes."

  "060041charley": {
    "note": " A classic Scottish folk song shows up in Hades when Joe Hynes refers to C. P. M'Coy as \"Charley\" and recalls that he \"was on the Freeman once.\" Bloom thinks, \"So he was before he got the job in the morgue under Louis Byrne. . . . Got the run. Levanted with the cash of a few ads. Charley, you're my darling. That was why he asked me to.\" Bloom's association of two Charleys may be purely superficial, but more likely—given the endless significations in Joyce's writing—it reflects his hunch that the dishonest M'Coy is avoiding contact with the newspaper that once employed him.",
    "expandedNote": " M'Coy not only steals people's suitcases. When he held the job that Bloom now holds, it seems that he made off with some money that businessmen had given him to pay for ads in the Freeman. To \"levant,\" according to the OED, is to steal away, to abscond, often used in connection with bettors who don't intend to pay up. M'Coy, then, may have wanted to avoid Paddy Dignam's funeral because that event was likely to be covered by someone from the newspaper (and, indeed, Joe Hynes is there). M'Coy is playing the same trick as Tom Kernan, mentioned a bit earlier in Hades as avoiding contact with the grocer Fogarty who has allowed him to run up a tab: \"Though lost to sight, Mr Dedalus said, to memory dear.\" \n The song commemorates the 1745 return to Scotland of Charles Edward Stuart, a.k.a. Bonnie Prince Charlie, a.k.a.\"The Young Pretender\" or \"The Young Chevalier.\" Charles was the grandson of King James II of England (King James VII of Scotland), whose alleged Catholic sympathies prompted the Revolution of 1688 that put William and Mary in power, and who was decisively defeated by \"King Billy\" at the Battle of the Boyne in Ireland. Raised in Rome as a Catholic and a believer in the \"Jacobite\" cause, Charles returned to Scotland at the age of 25 to return his family to power, and his military campaign was initially successful. But after a crushing defeat at the Battle of Culloden in 1746 he went into hiding on the Scottish moors and then fled to the Isle of Skye—an action romanticized in another great Scottish air, The Skye Boat Song. The flight from Scotland is the part of his story that seems relevant to Ulysses, though perhaps Charles Stuart's ignominious subsequent existence as a continental exile addicted to love affairs (he had many darlings), alcohol, and Jacobite intrigues hovers about the edges of the comparison.\n The effect of Bloom's alluding to the song, then, may be to suggest that Charley M'Coy is a failed and exiled pretender. As Zack Bowen puts it, \"The Stuarts were after the throne in the same way that M'Coy was after the Freeman funds. As Charley M'Coy was banished from the Freeman, so the Pretender was banished from England, and neither dared show his face. . . . Prince Charlie was banished to France under Louis XV, while Charley M'Coy was banished to the morgue under Louis Byrne.\" \n The song itself contains no dismal anticipations of Charles Stuart's dismal end. It caught on in Ireland because it breathed a spirit of hope to a disenfranchised Catholic nation:\n Twas on a Monday morning, \n Right early in the year, \n When Charlie came to our town \n The young chevalier. \n Chorus\n Charlie is my darling, my darling, my darling. \n Charlie is my darling, the young Chevalier. \n As he came marchin' up the street, \n The pipes played loud and clear. \n And a' the folk came rinnin' out \n To meet the Chevalier. \n Chorus \n Wi' highland bonnets on their heads \n And claymores bright and clear, \n They came to fight for Scotland's right \n And the young Chevalier. \n Chorus \n They've left their bonnie highland hills, \n Their wives and bairnies dear, \n To draw the sword for Scotland's lord, \n The young Chevalier. \n Chorus \n Oh, there were many beating hearts, \n And mony a hope and fear, \n And mony were the pray'rs put up, \n For the young Chevalier.\n Chorus\n The original patriotic words, reproduced here, were penned to a traditional tune in 1745 by Carolina Oliphant, Lady Nairne, the talented songwriter who also composed \"Will ye no' come back again?,\" another moving song about the Bonnie Prince. In 1794 Robert Burns wrote a new version, celebrating Charlie's conquests between the sheets. Burns' lines have become as well known as Lady Nairne's, and they are sung in the two performances featured here."

    "note": " After one long recollection of Paris centered on Patrice Egan, and another focused on his own foolish pretensions, Stephen lapses into French a third time with thoughts that center on Kevin Egan. This note translates the French phrases, with some contextualizing interpretation.",
    "expandedNote": " Stephen imagines \"Paris rawly waking,\" and two imaginary women named Yvonne and Madeleine sitting in \"Rodot's,\" a patisserie on the Boulevard Saint-Michel, \"shattering with gold teeth chaussons of pastry, their mouths yellowed with the pus of flan breton. Faces of Paris men go by, their wellpleased pleasers, curled conquistadores.\" The chausson, or \"slipper,\" is a flaky pastry wrapped around a fruity interior. The Breton flan is a version of the Spanish one, usually containing fruit. The word pus that Stephen applies to the custard's soft yellow filling has the same meaning in French as in English, with the same unsavory connotations. The word \"conquistadores\" is Spanish, of course, but Gifford observes that it is French slang for \"lady-killers.\"\n Morning gives way to \"noon,\" which Stephen thinks of as a soporific time, and he is in a cafe or cheap restaurant with Kevin Egan, who is sipping absinthe and smoking cigarettes. Someone, perhaps Kevin but more likely one of the \"gobblers\" shoving \"spiced beans down their gullets,\" orders \"Un demi setier!\" Gifford, apparently reading this as an anticipation of the sentence that follows (\"A jet of coffee steam from the burnished caldron\"), translates it as referring to a demitasse of coffee that Egan is ordering for Stephen. But in separate personal communications from France, Pierre Jeanjean and Karim Benslama observe that a setier (an old word, Rabelaisian in feel) is about 49 cl, roughly the same as a British pint. It makes much more sense to imagine a bean-gobbler ordering a half-pint of beer with his noon meal than Egan ordering a demitasse of coffee for Stephen. \n The sentences that follow, however, recall a waitress coming to the table at Egan's \"beck\" and misunderstanding his introduction of the visitor from Ireland: \"Il est irlandais. Hollandais? Non fromage. Deux irlandais, nous, Irlande, vous savez ah, oui!\" (He's Irish. Hollandais? Not cheese! We're two Irishmen, Ireland, you understand? Ah, yes!). Kevin has told her that Stephen is Irish, but instead of \"irlandais\" she has heard \"Hollandais,\" and assumes that Kevin is ordering food for his guest: \"She thought you wanted a cheese hollandais.\" \n After some talk about Irish matters, Egan mentions a Frenchman's description of Queen Victoria of England: \"Vieille ogresse with the dents jaunes,\" an old ogre with yellow teeth. Egan lapses into French again when he tells Stephen about the \"froeken\" (fröken, Swedish for an unmarried young woman) who rubs men down at the bath \"at Upsala.\" He seems to be talking about Uppsala, one of the largest cities in Sweden, but if so it is not clear why he would represent the young woman in the establishment as speaking French. But so she does in Egan's narration, this \"bonne à tout faire\" (maid of all work). \"Moi faire, she said, Tous les messieurs\" (I do all the gentlemen). \n Finally, French appears once more very briefly as Stephen recalls how someone, either Kevin Egan or his estranged wife, asked him to say hello to Patrice: \"Tell Pat you saw me, won't you? I wanted to get poor Pat a job one time. Mon fils\" (my son), \"soldier of France.\" Stephen has been thinking about the wife for several sentences before this point, so it seems natural to regard these as her words, recollected from some visit he paid her. But immediately after this, the \"I\" tells Stephen how he taught Patrice to sing \"The Boys of Kilkenny.\" And this must be Kevin Egan, because he takes Stephen by the hand and sings the song to him (\"Weak wasting hand on mine. They have forgotten Kevin Egan, not he them\"). So the referent of \"mon\" seems obscure."

  "030094chippendale": {
    "note": " A minor domestic comedy unfolds as Stephen imagines his uncle Richie commanding him to have a seat (\"Sit down or by the law Harry I'll knock you down\"), prompting his son Walter to observe that there are no chairs in the bedroom (\"He has nothing to sit down on, sir\"), prompting Richie to repeat the observation as if it is Walter's fault (\"He has nowhere to put it, you mug. Bring in our chippendale chair\"). Clearly, the Chippendale is the one good chair in the house.",
    "expandedNote": " Chippendale is a late-eighteenth century style of furniture named after the English cabinetmaker Thomas Chippendale. Many Chippendale chairs were made in a Rococo style, modified from French models to appeal to slightly less extravagant English tastes. \"Irish Chippendale\" was an offshoot of mahogany furniture whose carvings were somewhat less exquisite than those of the English originals.\n In the Gouldings' solitary Chippendale chair one can perhaps see an instantiation of Irish Catholics' tenuous connection to the middle-class respectability that they last enjoyed in the Georgian era, before the troubles of the 1790s and the Act of Union that cemented their irrelevancy. Just as Simon Dedalus has held onto the family portraits as his family has moved to steadily less prepossessing domiciles, Richie Goulding has held onto one piece of furniture that proclaims bourgeois elegance."

  "100013christianbrother": {
    "note": " In Lestrygonians Bloom sees \"a christian brother\" buying sweets for his young students (\"Some school treat\"), and in Wandering Rocks some \"Christian brother boys\" are seen leaving a school in North Richmond Street in the afternoon, a scene anticipated inAraby. The parents of Stephen Dedalus disparage the Christian Brothers in A Portrait of the Artist as they try to get their son out of this school and into the nearby Belvedere College run by the more intellectually challenging, socially prestigious, and economically advantageous Jesuits.",
    "expandedNote": " The Congregation of Christian Brothers is a lay teaching order founded by Waterford merchant Edmund Rice in 1802 to promote the education of poor Catholic boys excluded by the 18th century penal laws. Although the name suggests a clerical order of monks or friars, the Christian Brothers are laymen who, in place of the monk's vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience, take temporary vows of chastity, poverty, and \"perseverance.\" Public contributions have always supported their schools, which keep rates low to make education affordable. The order has built schools all over Ireland, as well as many in England, Australia, India, and the Americas. There are three in Dublin, including the establishments on Synge Street and Westland Row that Flann O'Brien mocked uproariously in The Hard Life. The school on North Richmond Street is named for Daniel O'Connell, who seems to have played a role in its founding in 1828. Locally, it has long been called \"the working man's Belvedere.\"\n The O'Connell School figures in Joyce's fictions because his family lived nearby in the early 1890s and he briefly attended it. Araby begins, \"North Richmond Street, being blind, was a quiet street except at the hour when the Christian Brothers' School set the boys free.\" Wandering Rocks dramatizes just such a scene: \"Father Conmee turned the corner and walked along the North Circular road. . . . A band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street. All raised untidy caps. Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly. Christian brother boys.\" Joyce himself was one of those boys for several months starting in January 1893, after he finished his studies at Clongowes Wood College. \n John Conmee had been the rector at Clongowes, and he was now Prefect of Studies at Belvedere. One day in early 1893 John Joyce crossed paths with Conmee on Mountjoy Square, told him about the boy who had made a favorable impression on him at Clongowes, and asked him to admit James to Belvedere College free of charges, as Belvedere did for about a quarter of its students. Joyce included the event in A Portrait: \n —I walked bang into him, said Mr Dedalus for the fourth time, just at the corner of the square.\n —Then, I suppose, said Mrs Dedalus, he will be able to arrange it. I mean about Belvedere.\n —Of course he will, said Mr Dedalus. Don't I tell you he's provincial of the order now?\n —I never liked the idea of sending him to the christian brothers myself, says Mrs. Dedalus. \n —Christian brothers be damned! said Mr Dedalus. Is it with Paddy Stink and Micky Mud? No, let him stick to the jesuits in God's name since he began with them. They'll be of service to him in after years. Those are the fellows that can get you a position.\n —And they're a very rich order, aren't they, Simon?\n —Rather. They live well, I tell you. You saw their table at Clongowes. Fed up, by God, like gamecocks.\n John Joyce's snobbishness about a Jesuit education, which must have kept uneasy company with his indigence, communicated itself to his son, whose fictions do not represent the fact that he briefly endured the indignity of a Christian Brothers education. Gordon Bowker's biography notes that he told Herbert Gorman he had never attended their school (43).\n Christian Brothers schools have long been known for harsh rote learning enforced by harsh discipline. Their noble social aims notwithstanding, lack of \"obedience\" to church authorities or answerability to civic ones encouraged many of them, especially industrial schools like the one at Artane, to condone savage beatings of children (despite Rice's forward-thinking prohibition of corporal punishment), and to overlook rampant sexual abuse. Their reputation is now fatally blackened, along with other Irish Catholic institutions like orphanages and laundries, but the Christian Brothers were a shaping force in Irish society for two centuries, offering primary and secondary education to children who might not otherwise have succeeded economically. Until the scandals broke they ensured their continuing centrality in 20th century culture by fostering several generations of nationalist Catholic leaders. \n The pandybat scene in part 1 of A Portrait shows that even Jesuit schools were not free of cruel and unjust punishments, and An Encounter suggests that the public \"National Schools,\" which mostly trained students for the workplace, may have rivaled the Christian Brothers for violent abuse. The boy who narrates the story is asked by a strange man about his friend, \"did he get whipped often at school. I was going to reply indignantly that we were not National School boys to bewhipped, as he called it.\" The seductive opportunity that sadists and pederasts discover in holding power over young schoolboys is vividly evoked in the horrifying sentences that follow, as the stranger begins \"to speak on the subject of chastising boys.\""

  "010017chrysostomos": {
    "note": " The Greek word \"Chrysostomos\" in the tenth paragraph of Telemachus compounds Chrysos (gold) and stoma (mouth). Several orators of antiquity acquired this epithet \"golden-mouthed,\" notably St. John Chrysostomos (ca. 349-407), a renowned speaker and one of the Three Holy Hierarchs of the Greek Orthodox faith. The odd one-word sentence appears to comment on Mulligan's \"even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points,\" in the previous sentence. It is the first appearance in Ulysses of the book's revolutionary stylistic device of interior monologue, often mislabeled stream of consciousness.",
    "expandedNote": " Bernard Benstock says of this cryptic one-word sentence, \"As a comment on Buck's dental work it is redundant; as a narrative comment it is out of place\" (Critical Essays, 3). Who is thinking this odd thought? There is only one good possibility: the person standing next to Buck Mulligan, watching his moving mouth, listening to his verbal pyrotechnics. Stephen is the kind of person who can muse on church fathers before his first cup of tea, and also the kind of person who would notice that one of Mulligan's middle names is \"St John,\" linking him with St. John Chrysostomos. And, as Benstock also observes, Stephen repeatedly thinks of Mulligan in damning one-word judgments: \"Usurper\" at the end of Telemachus, \"Catamite\" in Scylla and Charybdis, \"Chrysostomos\" (i.e., glib speaker) here. \n Joyce said often that the minor French novelist Édouard Dujardin inspired him to create the internal, unspoken thoughts of his characters in this way. Ellmann tells the story of how Joyce came upon the novel Les lauriers sont coupés (1888), and he describes the technique of Dujardin’s experimental novel, an extended soliloquy that does without any third-person narration (126). He also quotes several sayings that evoke the book’s appeal to Joyce. One is a sentence of Fichte that inspired Dujardin: “The I poses itself and opposes itself to the not-I.” The others are Dujardin’s: “the life of the mind is a continual mixing of lyricism and prose,” and the novel must therefore balance “poetic exaltation and the ordinariness of any old day.” \n In “Chrysostomos,” one can hear Joyce's deployment of these Symbolist oppositions of a poetic inward reality and a mundane outward environment. The word takes us for one moment into the fanciful realm of Stephen’s thoughts, where ordinary images like gold and white teeth become imbued with psychological, moral, and spiritual signifiance. Stephen's single word defines the \"not-I,\" Mulligan, as a glib coiner of elegant phrases who does not use language in the service of truth. This is our first real glimpse of the \"I\" that is Stephen, an ego desperately defining itself in opposition to other human beings.\n The term that Joyce used to describe Dujardin’s innovation, monologue intérieur, did not originate with either man. According to Ellmann, Valery Larbaud found the expression in Paul Bourget’s Cosmopolis (1893) and gave it to his friend Joyce as a tool for discussing the author’s big new book (519). Joyce soon felt that the phrase had outlived its usefulness and went searching for others that might point readers toward what he was trying to do in the novel. But his endorsement of “interior monologue” should recommend it over the similar phrase, “stream of consciousness,” that readers often apply to Ulysses. Only Molly Bloom’s interior thoughts can justly be called streaming. \n [2014] Kevin Birmingham makes this point well in The Most Dangerous Book: The Battle for James Joyce's Ulysses (2014). He says of the novel's style, “Thoughts don’t flow like the luxuriant sentences of Henry James. Consciousness is not a stream. It is a brief assembly of fragments on the margins of the deep, a rusty boot briefly washed ashore before the tide reclaims it.”\n JH 2011"

  "070014circulation": {
    "note": " Calling Sackville Street the heart of the metropolis is a metaphor, but coming where it does in the text—just before clanking tramcars, creaking mailcars, thudding barrels, thumping printingpresses—the phrase insinuates a near equivalence between human bodies of flesh and blood and civic bodies of steel and electricity.",
    "expandedNote": " If human bodies can be understood as assemblages of interrelated physical systems, then the interrelated physical systems comprising the humming life of a city may perhaps be understood as bodies as well. That analogy is implied by Joyce's use of the word heart as the lead-in to a section describing tramcars departing from the central dispatch station at Nelson's pillar for far-flung termini around the circumference of Dublin, and returning again to the center. InHades Bloom thinks of the heart as a pump moving blood around the body; in death, \"The circulation stops.\" And when, at the end of Aeolus, an electrical malfunction leaves inbound and outbound cars on eight different tracks \"all still, becalmed in short circuit,\" the circulation of the city stops.\n After the initial look at the tramways, the episode glances at another complex system of transportation and communication: the cars, trains, and boats required to move mail around Ireland and to England. Then the reader's attention is directed to still another kind of circulation: a major newspaper, whose offices are located close to the tram dispatch center and the General Post Office. We learn \"HOW A GREAT DAILY ORGAN IS TURNED OUT,\" and later the hissing paper feeds give the impression of an animal trying to speak: \"Sllt. The nethermost deck of the first machine jogged forward its flyboard with sllt the first batch of quirefolded papers. Sllt. Almost human the way it sllt to call attention. Doing its level best to speak. That door too sllt creaking, asking to be shut. Everything speaks in its own way. Sllt.\"\n Joyce's schemas identify the heart as the \"organ\" of the previous episode. Hades makes frequent references to the heart as the proverbial seat of the emotions, but it also returns repeatedly to the scientific knowledge that the heart maintains life by pumping oxygenated blood through the body. Martin Cunningham says that Paddy Dignam died of a \"Breakdown . . . Heart.\" To Bloom, the heart is essentially no different from a mechanical contraption: \"A pump after all, pumping thousands of gallons of blood every day. One fine day it gets bunged up: and there you are. Lots of them lying around here: lungs, hearts, livers. Old rusty pumps: damn the thing else.\" Bloom's thoughts in Aeolus about the owner of the newspaper suggest an analogy: \"But will he save the circulation? Thumping. Thumping.\"\n The thumping of the presses returns Bloom to his meditations on organic dissolution. Mechanical and biological processes combine in a vision of senseless pounding activity: \"Thumping. Thump. This morning the remains of the late Mr Patrick Dignam. Machines. Smash a man to atoms if they got him caught. Rule the world today. His machineries are pegging away too. Like these, got out of hand: fermenting. Working away, tearing away. And that old grey rat tearing to get in.\""

  "040074citrons": {
    "note": " The \"citrons\" that are shipped from Palestine to Ireland are one of the original citrus fruits, ancestors of modern-day lemons, limes, oranges, grapefruits, and other products of hybridization. They play an important role in the Jewish Sukkot ritual, as Bloom thinks when he remembers Moisel saying, \"Must be without a flaw.\"",
    "expandedNote": " Scientists believe that the four original, purely natural citrus fruits were the citron, the pomelo, the mandarin, and the papeda. Through cross-breeding human beings have developed the forms that are more familiar today. Citrons resemble lemons, but they have a thick, leathery rind and a small, dry, unpalatable pulp. The outer part of the rind, called the flavedo, is very fragrant, as Bloom recalls happily: \"Nice to hold, cool waxen fruit, hold in the hand, lift it to the nostrils and smell the perfume. Like that, heavy, sweet, wild perfume.\" The larger white part of the rind is edible, and is cooked with sugar to make jams, preserves, relishes, pickles, and fruitcakes. \n Jews use the citron ritually during Sukkot, the week-long Feast of Tabernacles or Feast of Ingathering. This autumn holiday celebrates both the agricultural harvest and the deliverance from slavery in Egypt, when the Hebrews lived in tents for 40 years. On each day of the week, a citron fruit (the ethrog or etrog) is brought into the synagogue and waved about with three species of greenery: a closed frond of the date palm tree and leafy branches of willow and myrtle trees (collectively called the lulav, though the term also applies to the date frond alone). Various kinds of symbolism attach to these Four Species, and the specimens must be \"without a flaw,\" as Moisel says. Relatively large sums of money can be spent on them, especially for the etrog. Bloom thinks \"They fetched high prices too, Moisel told me.\""

  "020066cityarms": {
    "note": " The \"City Arms\" hotel, located in the northwest part of central Dublin on Prussia Street near the North Circular Road, is mentioned often in Ulysses—twice in connection with \"a meeting of the cattletraders' association,\" and many more times because Leopold and Molly Bloom lived there for parts of 1893 and 1894, when Bloom had a job with Joseph Cuffe, a trader at the nearby cattle market.",
    "expandedNote": " Mr. Deasy tells Stephen that he has asked \"Mr Field, M.P.\" to present his letter about foot-and-mouth disease to the cattletraders' group. Gifford notes that in 1904 William Field was a member of Parliament and also the president of the Irish Cattle Traders and Stock Owners Association, which held meetings every Thursday at its offices in the City Arms hotel. In Cyclops, Joe Hynes tells the narrator that \"I was up at that meeting in the City Arms,\" a meeting which was \"about the foot and mouth disease.\" He assumes that the Citizen will be interested.\n Both Bloom and Molly think often about their days in the hotel, and of the other inhabitants: a tortoiseshell cat \"with the letter em on her forehead\" (Nausicaa); Dante Riordan, Stephen's governess in A Portrait, who lived there with her Skye terrier, and with whom Bloom took great pains to ingratiate himself (Lestrygonians, Ithaca, Penelope); various \"country gougers\" who were in town to sell cattle (Penelope); Pisser Burke (Cyclops, Penelope); a Mrs. Duggan who talked about her husband \"rolling in drunk\" at night (Nausicaa). In Lestrygonians Bloom thinks of how Mrs. O'Dowd, the proprietress of the hotel, served meals in a communal fashion: \"Hate people all round you. City Arms hotel table d'hôte she called it. Soup, joint and sweet. Never know whose thoughts you're chewing.\" Molly took a similar dislike to the shared bathroom: \"that charming place on the landing always somebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them always know who was in there last.\""

  "030100clackback": {
    "note": " As he did in Telemachus in response to Mulligan's suggestion about Haines, Stephen briefly indulges a violent fantasy in Proteus only to change his mind in an instant and opt comedically for pacifism. His language suggests that he is visualizing the scene as a motion picture, running the film in reverse to bring the man back to life.",
    "expandedNote": " The memory of an employee who slammed the post office door in his face two minutes before closing time rouses Stephen's fury: \"Hired dog! Shoot him to bloody bits with a bang shotgun, bits man spattered walls all brass buttons. Bits all khrrrrklak in place clack back. Not hurt? O, that's all right. Shake hands. See what I meant, see? O, that's all right. Shake a shake. O, that's all only all right.\" Just as the alliterated sounds of the second sentence imitate a \"bang shotgun,\" the onomatopoeia and alliteration of the third sentence (\"khrrrrklak,\" \"clack back\") seem to evoke the metallic clanking and whirring of a movie projector. The \"bits\" of the man's body \"all\" move \"back\" into \"place\" in reverse slow motion.\n This cinematic special effect has become very familiar, but in the early 1900s it would have been as strikingly new as the medium itself. The Lumière brothers patented their cinematograph and shot the first true motion-picture film (one viewable by many people at once, as opposed to the peep-show machines called kinetoscopes or mutoscopes) in 1895. In 1896 Louis Lumière filmed Demolition of a Wall, which used reverse-motion footage for the first time. The brothers publically screened many of their earliest short films in Paris, before taking them to other major cities around the world. \n In December 1909 Joyce returned from Trieste to launch Dublin's first full-time cinema, on Mary Street. His involvement in the Volta Cinematograph lasted for less than a year, but it demonstrates his fascination with the new technology of moviemaking (as well as his capacity for entrepreneurship). \n In \"Joyce, Benjamin, and the Futurity of Fiction,\" an essay in the collection Joyce, Benjamin, and Magical Urbanism (Rodopi, 2011), edited by Maurizia Boscagli and Enda Duffy, Heyward Ehrlich writes, \"Joyce was careful to avoid anachronisms in representing photography and cinema in Ulysses, which takes place five years before his attempt to open the Volta as a permanent cinema house in 1909. Traveling cinematographic companies had performed in Dublin before 1904, but Joyce limits Bloom's knowledge to the pre-cinematic mutoscope. By contrast, Stephen—and presumably Joyce as well—has seen a movie in Paris, and one of his poignant memories of his stay there is represented as a cinematic hallucination in Proteus\" (207).\n Joyce seems to have had a keen awareness of the new visual medium's capacity for \"kinetic\" (Stephen's word in A Portrait) representations of the human body, both sexual and violent. Ulysses associates both the photograph and the mutoscope with prurient sexual voyeurism. Stephen's imagination of how cinema could show bodies blown to bloody bits (and then reconstituted) seems almost prophetic in light of the movies of the last fifty years."

    "note": " Professor MacHugh's reference in Aeolus to the \"cloacal obsession\" of the Romans and the English delivers a thunderous backhand smash to a charge lobbed at Joyce by H. G. Wells in 1917. Wells coined this phrase in a review essay that, while mostly quite generous to Joyce, also frankly expressed English prejudices against Irish Catholics. Joyce's adoption of the phrase responds to these prejudices by reversing their values: taking excessive interest in coarse bodily functions, he suggests, is far less contemptible than repressing them out of consciousness altogether.",
    "expandedNote": " In a review of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man published in both the 24 February 1917 issue of The Nation and the 10 March 1917 issue of The New Republic, the famous English writer (his four best-known works of science fiction were published from 1895 to 1898, and starting in 1921 he was nominated four times for a Nobel prize) lavishly celebrated the young Irishman's novel: \"Its claim to be literature is as good as the claim of the last book of Gulliver's Travels. . . . The technique is startling, but on the whole it succeeds. Like so many Irish writers from Sterne to Shaw, Mr. Joyce is a bold experimentalist with paragraph and punctuation. He breaks away from scene to scene without a hint of the change of time and place; at the end he passes suddenly from the third person to the first; he uses no inverted commas to mark off his speeches. . . . One conversation in this book is a superb success, the one in which Mr. Dedalus carves the Christmas turkey; I write with all due deliberation that Sterne himself could not have done it better. . . . One believes in Stephen Dedalus as one believes in few characters in fiction.\"\n High praise, though salted with a few reservations. But Wells appreciated Joyce's writing in part because it so skillfully portrayed the obsessions of a backward people: \"Like some of the best novels in the world it is the story of an education; it is by far the most living and convincing picture that exists of an Irish Catholic upbringing. . . . The interest of the book depends entirely upon its quintessential and unfailing reality. . . . And the peculiar lie of the interest for the intelligent reader is the convincing revelation it makes of the limitations of a great mass of Irishmen. Mr. Joyce tells us unsparingly of the adolescence of this youngster under conditions that have passed almost altogether out of English life. There is an immense shyness, a profound secrecy, about matters of sex, with its inevitable accompaniment of nightmare revelations and furtive scribblings in unpleasant places, and there is a living belief in a real hell.\" \n Wells sounds much like Haines, who assents in Wandering Rocks to Mulligan's explanation of how Stephen became so addled: \"They drove his wits astray . . . by visions of hell.\" He resembles Haines too in his inability to imagine why \"these bright-green young people across the Channel\" would not wish to make common cause with the good-hearted English Liberals laboring to help them: \"everyone in this Dublin story, every human being, accepts as a matter of course, as a thing in nature like the sky and the sea, that the English are to be hated. There is no discrimination in that hatred, there is no gleam of recognition that a considerable number of Englishmen have displayed a very earnest disposition to put matters right with Ireland, there is an absolute absence of any idea of a discussed settlement, any notion of helping the slow-witted Englishman in his three-cornered puzzle between North and South. It is just hate, a cant cultivated to the pitch of monomania, an ungenerous violent direction of the mind. That is the political atmosphere in which Stephen Dedalus grows up, and in which his essentially responsive mind orients itself.\" Wells feared that this unreasonably militant Irish nationalism would \"play into the hands of the Tories\" in the British Parliament, threatening social reform and provoking violent repression.\n On all these matters of religion, sexuality, and politics Wells sees Joyce as simply giving an accurate representation of Ireland's benighted culture. But on one point he faults Joyce's own proclivities: \"It is no good trying to minimize a characteristic that seems to be deliberately obtruded. Like Swift and another living Irish writer, Mr. Joyce has a cloacal obsession. He would bring back into the general picture of life aspects which modern drainage and modern decorum have taken out of ordinary intercourse and conversation. Coarse, unfamiliar words are scattered about the book unpleasantly, and it may seem to many, needlessly. If the reader is squeamish upon these matters, then there is nothing for it but to shun this book. . . . But that is by the way. The value of Mr. Joyce's book has little to do with its incidental unsanitary condition.\" \n In hindsight it seems incredible that Wells should have beheld the horror of Joyce's gutter-mind merely from reading A Portrait, which is positively virginal compared to the flood of obscenity that would soon arrive on the pages of Ulysses. But he is objecting to \"words,\" and to the bodily functions that those words name. He is not bothered by just any kind of corporeality. When Stephen records his lack of aversion to strong smells, and takes comfort in the odor of \"horse piss and rotted straw,\" Wells absolves Joyce of any \"deliberate offense,\" reflecting that different human beings have different sensory inclinations. But the limits of his tolerance are exceeded when the novel refers to things that \"modern drainage\" has made inconspicuous. These realities, he says, are \"deliberately obtruded\" in A Portrait. The word comes from roots meaning \"to push towards,\" and it conveys not only Joyce's pushy offensiveness but also the cultivated Englishman's dislike of anything pushed out of the human body. One can only imagine Wells' disgust when he read Ulysses, which not only mentions urination, defecation, ejaculation, menstruation, expectoration, eructation, and nose-picking but shows most of those things happening in real time. It is known that he did not much care for the book.\n Wells objects to Joyce's \"cloacal obsession\" with substances that should be flushed out of sight rather than pondered. In modern metaphorical usage the word designates the anal cavities in birds and fish into which intestinal, urinary, and genital discharges all flow, but in their original Latin signification cloacae were sewers. With his characteristic linguistic precision Joyce turned Wells' phrase back on him by giving it to a classical scholar who prefers the ancient Greeks to the Romans: \"— What was their civilisation? Vast, I allow: but vile. Cloacae: sewers. The Jews in the wilderness and on the mountaintop said: It is meet to be here. Let us build an altar to Jehovah. The Roman, like the Englishman who follows in his footsteps, brought to every new shore on which he set his foot (on our shore he never set it) only his cloacal obsession. He gazed about him in his toga and he said: It is meet to be here. Let us construct a watercloset.\"\n It is sometimes said that the Romans invented only one thing: concrete. They took their mythology, literature, philosophy, rhetoric, sculpture, architecture, and music from the Greeks but were supremely innovative in building roads, bridges, piers, fountains, aqueducts, toilets, sewers, and torture-theaters. Professor MacHugh suggests that this indicates a certain spiritual poverty, and through him Joyce indicts the repressiveness of the English, who fancy themselves superior not only to other nations but even to the bodies into which they are born. People who pretend never to have heard certain \"Coarse, unfamiliar words,\" or to care much about the daily realities to which those words refer, have an \"obsession\" as crippling as any they despise in their neighbors across the Irish Sea."

  "010157clongowes": {
    "note": " \"Clongowes\" refers to Clongowes Wood College, a boys' boarding school run by the Jesuits in Sallins, County Kildare, a short distance west of Dublin. James Joyce was a student at Clongowes from 1888 to 1891 (ages 6-9), as was his fictional avatar Stephen Dedalus, whose life-defining experiences there are represented in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. Joyce had to leave when his father could no longer afford the bills, and the same appears to be true of Stephen.",
    "expandedNote": " Many people at the time regarded Clongowes as the best Catholic school in Ireland, and a Jesuit education could be not only intellectually formidable but also socially advantageous. John Joyce took pride in the fact that his sons were educated so prestigiously. In A Portrait, Simon Dedalus refers contemptuously to the less distinguished Christian Brothers as “Paddy Stink and Micky Mud. No, let him stick to the jesuits in God’s name since he began with them. They’ll be of service to him in after years. Those are the fellows that can get you a position.” Stephen perhaps shares some of his father's pride in his education, but he also thinks ruefully of the gulf between his family (middle-middle-class and declining rapidly) and the upbringings that most of his classmates enjoyed. In Proteus he thinks of the lies he invented to save face: \"You told the Clongowes gentry you had an uncle a judge and an uncle a general in the army. Come out of them, Stephen. Beauty is not there.\" \n Experiences from his days at Clongowes continue to fill Stephen's mind. In Telemachus he remembers how \"I carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes. I am another now and yet the same.\" In Proteus, as he imagines trying to save a drowning man, he thinks back to his reactions to the water basin at school. \"Water cold soft. When I put my face into it in the basin at Clongowes. Can't see! Who's behind me? Out quickly, quickly!\" Still another experience with cold water at Clongowes—being pushed into a cesspool by a sadistic classmate—lies behind his morbid fear of the element. In Ithaca Stephen remembers his time with \"Brother Michael in the infirmary of the college of the Society of Jesus at Clongowes Wood,\" as he recovered from the alarming infection acquired in this incident.\n In Wandering Rocks, Father John Conmee, who was the Rector of Clongowes during Stephen's time, recalls walking through the green fields that surround the school: \"His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of Clongowes field. He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard the cries of the boys' lines at their play, young cries in the quiet evening. He was their rector: his reign was mild.\""

    "note": " Among the many parallels between Stephen’s first three chapters and Bloom’s first three is the similar way in which the two men's moods respond physically to the presence or absence of sunlight. The warm light that greets Stephen on the first page of Telemachus,and Bloom when he leaves his home in pursuit of meat, disappears several pages later when a cloud obscures the sun—an adumbration of the dramatic thunderstorm that will visit Dublin later in the day. The dark chill in the atmosphere produces a similar effect in the psyches of both men, and when the sun returns several minutes later their moods brighten.",
    "expandedNote": " Nearly seven pages into Telemachus (248 lines into Gabler’s lineated edition), “A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, shadowing the bay behind him in deeper green.” A little more than six pages into Calypso (218 lines in Gabler), “A cloud began to cover the sun, slowly, wholly. Grey. Far.” Given the distance between the two men (between five and ten miles), they cannot be seeing the same eclipse at precisely the same instant. But given the close locations of these passages in each episode, it seems likely that they are seeing the same eclipse at very nearly the same instant.\n The sense of simultaneity is reinforced by what happens next. Some forty lines after a cloud begins to obscure the sun in Telemachus, Stephen “heard warm running sunlight” on the morning air. Some twenty-five lines after the cloud begins to cover the sun in Calypso, “Quick warm sunlight came running from Berkeley Road, swiftly in slim sandals, along the brightening footpath” to greet Bloom. \n In both cases, the sun's reappearance coincides with a move away from depressing thoughts. Stephen's gloomy memories of his mother's dying, and the nightmarish dream in which her ghost visited him, give way to Mulligan's cheerful call to breakfast and the thought of being paid today. Bloom's reflection that Palestine is not a utopia but a grey wasteland, and the Jewish people an old exhausted race, gives way to thoughts of breakfast with Molly. \n The corporeal basis of these shifting moods is made especially evident in Bloom's case: \"Dead: an old woman's: the grey sunken cunt of the world. / Desolation. / Grey horror seared his flesh. Folding the page into his pocket he turned into Eccles street, hurrying homeward. Cold oils slid along his veins, chilling his blood: age crusting him with a salt cloak. . . . To smell the gentle smoke of tea, fume of the pan, sizzling butter. Be near her ample bedwarmed flesh. Yes, yes.\"\n Much later in the book, in Ithaca, the reader learns at last that the two men were indeed seeing the same cloud at roughly the same time: Stephen attributes his collapse in Circe to \"the reapparition of a matutinal cloud (perceived by both from two different points of observation, Sandycove and Dublin) at first no bigger than a woman's hand.\""

    "note": " \"You, Cochrane\": the second episode, usually called Nestor, finds Stephen teaching boys in a private school in the town of Dalkey, about a mile south and a little east of the Sandycove tower. The urban directory that Joyce consulted extensively to create a realistic portrait of people and places in 1904 Dublin, referred to in these notes simply as Thom's, shows that a Charles H. Cochrane lived in Cambridge House, 38 Ulverton Road, Dalkey. Mr. Cochrane worked as a solicitor from offices on Frederick Street in Dublin—a fact consistent with Stephen's thoughts in later paragraphs that the boys in the school are \"Welloff people,\" well aware of \"the fees their papas pay.\"",
    "expandedNote": " The information comes from the 1904 edition of Thom's Dublin Directory. Alexander Thom, born in Scotland in 1801, came to Ireland with his family in 1813 and first published Thom's Irish Almanac and Official Directory in 1844. The Dublin Street Directory is still published annually (see www.thoms.ie). Joyce used the 1904 edition to reconstruct Dublin from his places of exile on the Continent, as Vladimir Nabokov observed in Lectures on Literature: \"The Dublin setting is built partly on data supplied by an exile's memory, but mainly on data from Thom's Dublin Directory.\" The name \"Cochrane\" is the first instance in Ulysses of this reliance on Thom's.\n Examination of the Thom's page reproduced at right will reveal a staggering number of crowded \"tenements,\" \"vacant\" properties, and sheer \"ruins,\" scattered among the addresses occupied by middle-class property owners and renters. Joyce's fiction largely concerns itself with this small and precarious Catholic middle class, glancing only occasionally at the moneyed Protestants who live in places like Dalkey, and the miserable masses crammed into tenements, boarding houses, and paupers' homes."

He writes: \"One thing I learned in recent weeks is that the sand is not at its driest at the time when the tide is lowest.

The largest of the channels is called 'Cockle Lake' on the charts, or as Joyce would have it 'Cock Lake'. The sand continues to dry out for several more hours until eventually inundated by the returning tide.\"\n \"Cock Lake\" was not Joyce's invention. That name can be seen on some contemporary maps, including the one at right. But Connolly may nevertheless be right that \"Joyce would have it\" this way, since Stephen urinates in this paragraph, his urine mingling with the swirling waters of the rivulet."

  "120014cockburn": {
    "note": " Perhaps ignorantly, or more likely in a spirit of sarcastic mockery, the Citizen mispronounces one of the English names he reads from the pages of the Irish Independent: \"Cockburn, at the Moat house, Chepstow.\" People in England pronounce this name \"Coburn\" (and sometimes spell it so), but the Citizen clearly pronounces it as it is spelled in the newspaper, because Joe Hynes jumps in with a remark about gonorrhea: \"— I know that fellow, says Joe, from bitter experience.\"",
    "expandedNote": " The Citizen's mispronuncation may be one more instance of him speaking confidently about things he does not understand: his capacity for ignorant blather should never be underestimated. But he may be deploying the ridiculous English name deliberately. Later in the chapter he puns on another sexually transmitted disease when Bloom tries to point out that the island next door has a highly achieved civilization: \"— Their syphilisation, you mean, says the citizen. To hell with them! The curse of a goodfornothing God light sideways on the bloody thicklugged sons of whores' gets! No music and no art and no literature worthy of the name. Any civilisation they have they stole from us.\" He is still riding the same horse a little later when J. J. O'Molloy refers to King Edward VII as \"the peacemaker:\" \"— Tell that to a fool, says the citizen. There's a bloody sight more pox than pax about that boyo.\" This comment sets his companions to joking about Albert Edward's omnivorous sexual exploits.\n Something about English names seems calculated to mock the prudish reserve with which some English people regard their bodies. In PenelopeMolly thinks of \"those awful names with bottom in them Mrs Ramsbottom or some other kind of a bottom.\" There are also English people named Reamsbottom, Shufflebottom, Longbottom, Bottomore, Bottomles, Bottoman, and Bottomers. The English countryside is dotted with similarly suggestive place names: Velvet Bottom, Scratchy Bottom, Slap Bottom, Galloping Bottom, Flash Bottom, Burnt Bottom, Broadbottom, Slackbottom, Hole Bottom, Happy Bottom, Paradise Bottom, Whambottom Lane, and the like. \n Cocks appear in many British family names like Handcock, Glasscock, Cockshott, Wilcocks, Stonecock, and Bullcock, as well as places like Cockermouth, Cockshot, Cockshoot Close, Cockshot Wood, the Cockup Lake District, Cockplay, and Cocking. Add in the many variations on Balls, Butts, Tit, Titty, Piddle, Furry, Bush, Clit, Prick, Lick, Fanny, Dicks, and Nut, and—even after allowing for the fact that many of these words have acquired new meanings over the course of centuries—the entire English countryside seems to be staging a maniacal return of the repressed. Monty Python could not make it up better.\n But the notion of using \"cock burn\" to mock the hated English would probably never occur to the Citizen if he did not live in a city housing the largest red-light district north of Morocco. Joe Hynes evidently spends some of his earnings in the Monto, as did Joyce and many respectable middle-class men of his day—enough of them to make STDs a feature of casual conversation. This is perhaps not a form of Irish cultural superiority to which the Citizen should be calling attention."

    "note": " \"Cockles,\" mentioned in several parts of the novel, are a kind of small clam. The familiar expression, \"warms the cockles of his heart\" (used by Bloom in Hades), apparently derives from the deep satisfaction of eating a good helping of these bivalves.",
    "expandedNote": " In Nausicaa Gerty MacDowell recalls eating \"stewed cockles and lettuce with Lazenby's salad dressing for supper\" with her father, and Bloom thinks of \"cockles and periwinkles,\" the latter a kind of edible sea snail. \n The people whom Stephen sees on the beach in Proteus are all harvesting cockles, despite the dangerous sewage contamination in this part of Dublin Bay. When he sees two older women come down \"the steps from Leahy's terrace\" and wonders, \"What has she in the bag?,\" he fancies that they are midwives toting \"A misbirth with a trailing navelcord.\" In fact, though, they have brought the bag with them to hold their day's catch, as we learn in Wandering Rocks: \"Two old women fresh from their whiff of the briny trudged through Irishtown along London bridge road, one with a sanded tired umbrella, one with a midwife's bag in which eleven cockles rolled.\" \n Later in the chapter, Stephen recognizes a gypsy-looking couple as \"Cocklepickers. They waded a little way in the water and, stooping, soused their bags and, lifting them again, waded out.\" Tossing their laden bags over their shoulders, they move on, and Stephen thinks of the \"Spoils slung at her back.\" \n Cockles dwell only an inch or so under the surface of the sand, so they are much easier to dig than larger clams."

  "030016coignofvantage": {
    "note": " In Proteus Stephen imagines his aunt's family spying out at a supposed \"dun\" (a bill collector) \"from a coign of vantage,\" i.e. an advantageous corner. The phrase comes from Shakespeare's Macbeth, in the scene in which King Duncan and his cohort ride up to Macbeth's castle, and Stephen's mulling of the phrase seems to have some influence on his decision not to pay the Gouldings a visit.",
    "expandedNote": " The King remarks that \"This castle hath a pleasant seat\" and that the air strikes the senses \"Nimbly and gently.\" Banquo agrees that \"the heaven's breath / Smells wooingly here,\" and he observes that martins nest all over the walls of the castle: \"no jutty, frieze, / Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird / Hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle. / Where they most breed and haunt, I have observ'd / The air is delicate\" (1.6.1-8).\n The thought of birds peering out of their pendant (i.e., hanging) beds pops into Stephen's mind, perhaps quite innocuously, when he thinks of his aunt's family peering down from cracks in the shuttered windows to see if a \"dun\" is at the door. But it is hard to ignore the context in which Banquo utters his phrase. King Duncan is entering the castle where he will soon be slaughtered, in his bed, by his hosts. Moments earlier, Lady Macbeth has invoked a less benign bird to herald his arrival: \"The raven himself is hoarse / That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan / Under my battlements\" (1.5.38-40). And immediately after Duncan and Banquo speak, she enters to welcome him under her battlements.\n Stephen may not fear being butchered in his aunt's house, but the allusion does suggest a certain hesitation to enter the shuttered domicile. He has just been savoring the breezes on the beach: \"Airs romped round him, nipping and eager airs.\" After thinking for a good long while of the kind of scene that will likely greet him inside the house, he decides not to sample its air: \"This wind is sweeter.\" Heaven's breath does not smell so wooingly in Strasburg Terrace. (After thinking that the wind smells sweeter on the beach, Stephen goes on to think \"Houses of decay, mine, his, and all. You told the Clongowes gentry you had an uncle a judge and an uncle a general in the army. Come out of them, Stephen. Beauty is not there.\") \n Later, in Scylla and Charybdis, Stephen again muses on the passage from Macbeth. Looking on Dublin's houses, he thinks: \"Kind air defined the coigns of houses in Kildare street. No birds.\""

  "020014coinoftribute": {
    "note": " In Nestor Stephen thinks of the broad \"shadow\" that Jesus of Nazareth cast on later times, and on the people of his own time. Several of the gospels tell the story of how the Pharisees attempted to entrap Jesus by asking him whether or not it was lawful to pay taxes to the Roman authorities. He confounded them by pointing to \"a coin of the tribute\" (i.e., a coin such as would be used to pay taxes) and telling them to give \"To Caesar what is Caesar's, to God what is God's.\"",
    "expandedNote": " If Jesus had said simply that it is lawful to pay taxes to Rome, the Pharisees could have argued that he did not support Jewish resistance to Roman occupation and taxation. If he had said no, they planned to hand him over to Pontius Pilate as an insurrectionist (Luke 20:20). Jesus avoided both these traps. Asking the Pharisees to produce a coin, he asked them whose image it bears. To their answer, \"Caesar's,\" he replied, \"Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's.\" At this wise and cunning answer, the Pharisees \"marvelled\" (Matt 22:22). Stephen reflects that, like so many of Jesus' parables and pronouncements, this anecdote offers a \"riddling sentence,\" an obscure wisdom \"to be woven and woven on the church's looms.\" Where Jesus spoke poetry, the Church must find doctrine. \n Many Christian authorities have quoted the sentence about the coin of tribute as implying a separation of secular and sacred responsibilities. It seems to cohere with Jesus' telling Pilate that \"My kingdom is not of this world\" (John 18:36): religious obedience is one thing, while political obedience is another, and the two need not clash. Reasonable as this interpretation may be, Stephen is not interested in reducing Jesus' subversive and elusive thoughts to Sunday school teachings. When he says that they have been woven on the church's looms, he uses the same metaphor for church theologians that he used in Telemachus to condemn the heretics who have opposed orthodox theology: \"The void awaits surely all them that weave the wind.\" Stephen remains focused in both passages (and indeed throughout the book) on the chasm between world and spirit, event and significance, surface and symbol. The \"long look from dark eyes\" that Jesus gave to the \"eager faces\" of the malevolent Pharisees was opaque to them, and would be no less opaque today."

  "030120collarofgold": {
    "note": " The phrase \"when Malachi wore the collar of gold\" comes verbatim from the song Let Erin Remember the Days of Old (1808), by the Irish Catholic songwiter Thomas Moore.",
    "expandedNote": " The lyrics, which Moore set to the tune of an existing song called The Red Fox, evoke the days of Irish kings before the coming of the Anglo-Normans:\n Let Erin remember the days of old\n Ere her faithless sons betrayed her;\n When Malachi wore the collar of gold\n Which he won from the proud invader;\nWhen her kings, with standard of green unfurled,\nLed the Red Branch Knights to danger\nEre the emerald gem of the western world\nWas set in the crown of a stranger. \n Malachi, or Máel Sechnaill (948-1022), was the High King of Ireland at the end of the 10th century. For many years he fought to expel the Norsemen centered in Dublin, sometimes in concert with his rival Brian Boru (Brian Boroimhe). In \"Irish Folk Songs in Joyce's Ulysses\" (PMLA 71.3, June 1956), Mabel Worthington notes that Malachi took the collar of the Norwegian prince Tomar from his neck after killing him (325)."

  "030030colouredsigns": {
    "note": " Stephen's repetition of \"coloured signs\" after the phrase \"Signatures of all things\" in the previous sentence might indicate a continuing meditation on the thoughts of Jakob Boehme, but Gifford hears in this phrase an allusion to the comparably idealistic thoughts of the Anglo-Irish philosopher George Berkeley. Whether or not Stephen can be shown to be pondering Berkeley at the beginning of Proteus, he is certainly doing so near the end of the episode when he thinks of \"the good bishop of Cloyne\" (Berkeley was a bishop in the Church of Ireland) reading the world as if it is a sacred text.",
    "expandedNote": " Unlike the traditionally Christian Boehme (1575-1624), who lived several generations before him, Berkeley (1685-1753) espoused an idealism which needed to respond to the subject-object dualism of Descartes (1596-1650) and the empiricism of philosophers like John Locke (1632-1704). For Berkeley, ideal reality had to be defined in terms of the human subject who perceived phenomena, rather than simply in terms of the divine being who created them. His response was to argue that the things we think we perceive cannot be shown to be things at all, but only conditions in the mind of the perceiver. When a human subject thinks that he sees a material object, all that he in fact sees are light and color (hence Stephen's \"coloured signs\"). What Berkeley called the \"immaterialism\" of this view might readily be reconciled with the mystical transcendentalism of a thinker such as Boehme, producing \"thought through my eyes.\"\n Near the end of Proteus Stephen continues his meditation on reading the world as if it is a text full of written signs, rather than a space full of material objects. He sees the objects of his sight as swatches of color on a flat perceptual canvas that thought (mis)interprets as three-dimensional space: \"Coloured on a flat: yes, that's right. Flat I see, then think distance, near, far, flat I see, east, back.\" Gifford helpfully glosses a sentence of Berkeley's, \"Vision is the Language of the Author of Nature,\" as meaning that \"the visible world is like a screen with signs on it, a screen that God presents to be read and thought rather than seen.\"\n Working with this idea of flat mental space, Stephen imagines that Berkeley \"took the veil of the temple out of his shovel hat: veil of space with coloured emblems hatched on its field.\" A veil is flat, and the veil of the temple is a sacred screen separating the holy of holies from the outside world, as Gifford observes in reading Exodus 26:31-35. The good bishop pulled this sacred veil out of his 18th century hat, i.e. he generated from his own mind a revolutionary understanding of perception as a window not onto an external world of material bodies, but onto the mental world of ideal realities."

  "020018columbanus": {
    "note": " The \"fiery Columbanus\" (ca. 540-615), whom Stephen thinks of in Nestor and again in Proteus, was an Irish monk who carried Christianity to continental Europe during the Dark Ages, founding monasteries in the feudal kingdoms of what are now France and northern Italy. According to Alban Butler's Lives of the Saints, he left his mother in Ireland \"grievously against her will,\" and in Nestor Stephen thinks of him striding across his forlorn mother's \"prostrate body\" in his \"holy zeal\" to spread the gospel.",
    "expandedNote": " Columbanus was famous not only for great learning and eloquence, but also for impetuous, headstrong passion. Stephen identifies with him as a man who broke away from home to go to France, and as someone who repaid his mother's love with injurious independence. In Proteus, he unflatteringly compares himself to Columbanus: \"You were going to do wonders, what? Missionary to Europe after fiery Columbanus.\" The thought of what a poor figure he cut in France leads him to think of two other Irish missionaries to the continent, laughing at him from their heavenly vantage: \"Fiacre and Scotus on their creepystools in heaven spilt from their pintpots, loudlatinlaughing: Euge! Euge!\" The Latin exclamation, Thornton observes, means something like \"Well done! Well done!\" Mockers shout the phrase ironically several times in the Vulgate versions of Psalms and Ezekiel.\n Saint Fiacre built a small monastery in France in the 7th century. Scotus, Thornton notes, could be either John Duns Scotus (a late 13th century Scholastic philosopher) or John Scotus Eriugena (a 9th century Neoplatonist theologian), both of them reputedly Irish. Though both are mentioned in Joyce's lecture \"Ireland, Island of Saints and Sages\" (along with Columbanus, they are the saints on whom the lecture primarily meditates), Thornton votes for Duns Scotus on the basis of a passage in Joyce's Alphabetical Notebook which served as a rough draft for the passage in Proteus. It mentions Duns Scotus in connection with Fiacre and Columbanus, and puts them on \"creepy-stools in heaven.\" \n Columbanus and Fiacre make another brief appearance in the novel in Cyclops, when Martin Cunningham's remark, \"God bless all here is my prayer,\" triggers the appearance of many dozens of \"mitred abbots and priors and guardians and monks and friars.\""

  "050049comehometoma": {
    "note": " At the beginning of Lotus Eaters Bloom watches a wretchedly poor boy and imagines his daily existence: \"Waiting outside pubs to bring da home. Come home to ma, da.\" This is the first of many moments in Ulysses when Joyce draws attention to the division of Irish society into stay-at-home women and linger-in-the-pub men. His observations of the harms done to Irish family life by constant drinking are frequent enough to be called a major theme of the novel.",
    "expandedNote": " The 1904 Dublin through which Bloom starts walking at 9 AM, not to return for nearly 17 hours, was an exceptionally homosocial place. Women figured marginally in its public life, in large part because so much of that life took place in public houses. It is hard to say how many of these popular gathering places actually banned females, but women were scarce enough to effectively segregate the alcoholic thirst and competitive social bonding of men from the domestic lives of families. Vincent Van Wyk points out in a personal communication that some Victorian and Edwardian pubs had partitioned rooms called \"snugs\" where women (or couples, or priests, or policemen sworn to sobriety) could drink privately, often behind doors locked from the inside. But Joyce does not mention any of these. His pubs are places for men to gather, and their atmosphere is jovial and relentlessly masculine. The monopoly is summed up in Sirenswhen Miss Douce says that men are \"frightful idiots\" and Miss Kennedy replies, \"It's them has the fine times.\"\n The gender divisions were not absolute. In response to the 19th century temperance movement, which cut into business, many publicans had diversified into groceries, tea, and wine, advertising themselves as \"spirit grocers\" or \"wine merchants\" and offering shopping in the front of the store. In recent years grocery store chains and other large firms have taken most of this business away from the pubs (though some of them still feature the old language on their shopfronts), but in 1904 the practice was still thriving. Women shopping for groceries could pick up wine or whiskey in the same shops, and drink it at home. \n Ulysses depicts several such women: the \"bent hag\" inCalypso that Bloom sees in front of \"Cassidy's, clutching a naggin bottle by the neck\"; Mrs. Dignam in Circe, \"her snubnose and cheeks flushed with deathtalk, tears, and Tunney's tawny sherry\"; Molly in Penelope, who thinks, \"Ill have to knock off the stout at dinner or am I getting too fond of it the last they sent from ORourkes was as flat as a pancake.\" In these details Joyce shows women drinking from all the major food groups—hard liquor, wine, beer—and he shows public houses doubling as package stores. O'Rourke's is the pub that Bloom passes in Calypso, and Tunney's is mentioned twice in one section of Wandering Rocks, when Patsy Dignam thinks of his mother sipping \"the superior tawny sherry uncle Barney brought from Tunney’s,\" and of his father's frequent visits to the pub: \"The last night pa was boosed he was standing on the landing there bawling out for his boots to go out to Tunney’s for to boose more.\" \n Women who had the inclination and the money to drink certainly could do so in 1904. In Hades Bloom commiserates with Martin Cunningham for having to endure \"that awful drunkard of a wife of his.\" Mrs. Cunningham has the habit of regularly \"pawning the furniture,\" probably for money to spend in spirit shops. Bloom thinks that \"she must have looked a sight that night Dedalus told me he was in there. Drunk about the place and capering with Martin's umbrella.\" But this display took place in the couple's home. Homes, and private parties in homes, afforded the only real opportunities for women to drink, while men could find establishments to walk into on every street, at every hour of the day. \n In several of the stories of Dubliners Joyce explored the tensions between the freedom that men feel in bars and the constraints they experience when they return home. \"Eveline\" tells the story of a young woman who lives in fear of her violent father and is wearied by \"the invariable squabble for money on Saturday nights,\" when he was \"usually fairly bad.\" \"A Little Cloud\" shows a family man having drinks with an old acquaintance and feeling frustrated with his unaccomplished life when he comes home, until he screams in rage at his infant child and is savagely rebuked by his wife. In \"Counterparts,\" Farrington's night of drinking ends with him beating his \"little boy\" with a stick. \n The narrative stream of these three stories flows uninterruptedly through Ulysses, where the gap separating men's public lives of drinking from their private lives of providing for families is visible at many points. InLestrygonians Nosey Flynn, sitting in the same pub where he sat in \"Counterparts,\" comments disapprovingly on having seen Bloom one day \"with a jar of cream in his hand taking it home to his better half. She's well nourished, I tell you. Plovers on toast.\" In Wandering Rocks Dilly Dedalus buttonholes her father to contribute a penny or two from his pocketful of drinking money to support his starving family, which he begrudgingly does: \"Get a glass of milk for yourself and a bun or a something. I’ll be home shortly.\" (Dublin remembers John Stanislaus Joyce as a \"street angel, house devil.\") In Oxen of the Sun the hospital's halls resonate with the raucous shouts of drunken young men while a woman struggles to give birth in her third day of labor. \n Nausicaa presents the perspective of the women who wait at home for their men to return. Gerty thinks of the effects of alcohol on her family: \"But that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cast its shadow over her childhood days. Nay, she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father, a prey to the fumes of intoxication, forget himself completely for if there was one thing of all things that Gerty knew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of kindness, deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low.\" Later in the same chapter, Bloom too thinks of what women have to put up with when their husbands come back from the pub: \"Worst of all at night Mrs Duggan told me in the City Arms. Husband rolling in drunk, stink of pub off him like a polecat. Have that in your nose in the dark, whiff of stale boose. Then ask in the morning: was I drunk last night?\" \n On this topic as on so many others, Molly Bloom has the last word. She knows that she is fortunate to have married a man who, after 17 hours tramping Dublin's streets, has consumed just one glass of wine and kept a careful mental tally of the day's expenses. Less prudent, more profligate men intrude repeatedly in her thoughts: Tom Kernan \"that bit his tongue off falling down the mens WC drunk in some place or other,\" Simon Dedalus who \"was always turning up half screwed\" at concerts in which he was about to perform, Professor Goodwin who \"was a patent professor of John Jameson,\" Paddy Dignam \"Im sorry in a way for him what are his wife and 5 children going to do unless he was insured comical little teetotum always stuck up in some pub corner and her or her son waiting Bill Bailey wont you please come home.\"\n Bloom has come home quite late on this unusual day, prompting Molly to \"hope hes not going to get in with those medicals leading him astray to imagine hes young again coming in at 4 in the morning it must be if not more still he had the manners not to wake me what do they find to gabber about all night squandering money and getting drunker and drunker couldnt they drink water.\" Even if Bloom has gotten carried away for once, she is determined not to let it become a regular thing: \"theyre a nice lot all of them well theyre not going to get my husband again into their clutches if I can help it making fun of him then behind his back I know well when he goes on with his idiotics because he has sense enough not to squander every penny piece he earns down their gullets and looks after his wife and family goodfornothings.\" \n Pubs proliferated at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution as havens from dehumanizing workplaces, and it seems that they quickly became havens from domestic responsibilites as well. Whether they still perform the latter function today is beyond this commentator's capacity to say, but the implicit ban on women in most Irish pubs has now been gone for a good half century. Some traditional pubs (e.g., John Clarke's in Irishtown, Thomas Maher's in Waterford, Pat Gleeson's in Kilkenny) remained all-male into the last few decades of the 20th century, but they were fighting a rear-guard action in the midst of a full-on retreat. \n A wonderful 1968 video from the archives of the RTÉ, which can be accessed at https://www.rte.ie/archives/2018/0403/951821-changing-face-of-dublin-pubs/, shows journalist Paddy Bolger's gruff acknowledgement of a whole new social scene in the Dublin bars of his time: women invading the male sanctum, bars becoming \"lounges,\" dark mahogany surfaces and product-branded mirrors giving way to glitzy decorations, fancy drinks being sipped so mincingly that deep swigs of porter suddenly seem gauche, musical acts spreading like a maniacal cancer, miniskirted thighs displayed by girls whose fathers should be looking after them, ridiculous games imported from England. Thanks to Cathal Coleman for recommending this marvelous video to me."

The connection seems improbable, but it is supported by another biblical allusion, Stephen's prayer in Scylla and Charybdis, \"O Lord, help my unbelief.\"",
    "expandedNote": " In Mark 1:23-26, a man \"with an unclean spirit\" cries out in the synagogue, \"Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.\" Jesus replies, \"Hold thy peace, and come out of him,\" and the unclean spirit violently leaves the man's body. (Mark's story is repeated in Luke 4:31-36.) Mark 9:25-27 recounts a similar event: \"When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him. And the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him: and he was as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead. But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose.\" \n It is not clear exactly what these echoes, if present, could add to one's understanding of Stephen's two sentences: he has committed many youthful follies, but he has never been possessed by a raging madness. It should be noted, however, that the verse just before the passage in which the second exorcism is narrated contains a saying that Stephen explicitly alludes to later in the novel. The father of the possessed boy tells Jesus how the spirit afflicts his son and says that Jesus' disciples have not been able to cast him out (Mark 9:17-18). Jesus responds by bemoaning the \"faithless generation\" that he must put up with (9:19), and tells the father, \"If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth\" (9:23). The father cries out, \"Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief\" (9:24). \n In Scylla and Charybdis Stephen repeats the father's words as he tries to maintain his faith in himself as a writer: \"I believe, O Lord, help my unbelief.\" Since he is thinking in the Proteus passage about what he must do to realize his artistic calling—come out of past follies, because they do not lead to Beauty—it does seem that he may somehow be channeling Jesus' strong sense of faith."

  "090013composition": {
    "note": " Stephen begins his Shakespeare talk in Scylla and Charybdis by inviting his listeners to imagine a scene from the playwright's life. \"It is this hour of a day in mid June,\" he says, just like the present moment in Dublin, but the year is 1601 and the place is the south bank of the Thames in greater London. Throwing out vivid details, he thinks, \"Local colour. Work in all you know. Make them accomplices.\" The method in his madness becomes clear a moment later: \"Composition of place. Ignatius Loyola, make haste to help me!\" Such setting of an imagined scene, using the powers of the senses to heighten mental awareness, was the foundation for meditative practices devised by the founder of the Jesuit order, Ignatius Loyola. Stephen follows Loyola's prescription by beginning his prolonged meditation on Shakespeare with the setting of a scene, and as the talk proceeds he returns often to the principle of creating vivid sensory pictures to engage the minds of his listeners.",
    "expandedNote": " In the early 1520s Loyola made a retreat at an abbey on a Catalonian mountain where the Benedictine monks introduced him to certain techniques of spiritual meditation, and he began composing, in Spanish, the devotional manual that would be published in Latin translation in 1548 as Spiritual Exercises. This work recommends 30 days of silent, solitary pondering of religious themes: events in the life of Jesus, the Savior's crucifixion and resurrection, the loving forgiveness of human sin manifested in God's sacrifice of his Son. The purpose is to bring the contemplator into a state of closeness with God—a quasi-mystical direct contact with the ineffable—by pondering important theological issues and seeking to align one's will more nearly with the divine will.\n Despite this highly abstract goal, many of the exercises begin quite mundanely with \"application of the senses.\" They recommend taking a passage from the gospels, imagining the scene in great concrete detail, concentrating on its sights, sounds, smells, textures, and even tastes, and dwelling quietly with the feelings and thoughts that arise in response. Immersed in the physical reality of the event, the meditator finds a corporeal foundation for intellectual and spiritual activity. Gifford quotes an especially relevant passage from the First Exercise, item 47: \"The first prelude is a composition, seeing the place. Here it is to be observed that in the contemplation or meditation of a visible object as in contemplating Christ our Lord, Who is visible, the composition will be to see with the eye of the imagination the corporeal place where the object I wish to contemplate is found. I say the corporeal place, such as the Temple or the mountain where Jesus Christ is found...\"\n The Spiritual Exercises fed into various streams of European culture: the revival of Catholic spirituality initiated by the counter-Reformation in the mid-16th century; the writings of John Donne and other English \"metaphysical\" poets of the 17th century; the pedagogical methods of Jesuit high schools and colleges in the 19th century. In that last category, the impact of Loyola's style of meditation is powerfully represented in the third part of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man when a Jesuit priest puts the fear of God into Stephen Dedalus and his classmates on a religious retreat. The terrifying pictures of Hell conjured up by the priest's sermons do not conform to Loyola's recommended subject matters: instead of contemplating Jesus' sufferings to gain awareness of God's abundant mercies they require the boys to ponder the eternal tortures awaiting sinners' poor spiritual choices. The method, however, is unmistakably Loyolan: set a scene, rub your audience's nose, eyes, ears, tongue, and skin in it, and set them on a cognitive path that will bring them back to God. \n Stephen appears deeply committed to this method of winning over an audience, albeit for non-devotional purposes. Asking them to call to mind a June day like the one they are presently in, he evokes the sight of the flag flying in front of the Globe theater, the growls of \"The bear Sackerson\" in the bearbaiting pit next door, the rough textures and vertiginous sensations of \"The canvasclimbers who sailed with Drake,\" the smells and tastes of their sausages as they stand crowded in among the groundlings. Shakespeare walks by swans along the Thames on his way to the theater, watching a mother busily herd her offspring into the rushes. The actor playing the ghost in Hamlet steps onto the stage, \"a wellset man with a bass voice.\" All the senses are engaged in this brief prelude to Stephen's Shakespeare meditations. \n After the introductory scene-setting Stephen's thoughts become more abstract, but he returns again and again to concrete sensory details: \"She bore his children and she laid pennies on his eyes to keep his eyelids closed when he lay on his deathbed'; \"poor Wat, sitting in his form, the cry of hounds, the studded bridle and her blue windows\"; \"a boldfaced Stratford wench who tumbles in a cornfield a lover younger than herself\"; \"Head, redconecapped, buffeted, brineblinded\"; \"Hot herringpies, green mugs of sack, honeysauces, sugar of roses, marchpane, gooseberried pigeons, ringocandies\"; \"Why did he not leave her his best bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in peace?\"; \"loosing her nightly waters on the jordan\"; \"His eyes watched it, lowlying on the horizon, eastward of the bear, as he walked by the slumberous summer fields at midnight returning from Shottery and from her arms.\" A large number of these vivid details concern Anne Hathaway, whose adultery is central to Stephen's argument about Shakespeare. \n Loyola's insistence on the importance of involving the human sensorium in spiritual practice provided one of the key weapons in the counter-Reformation's defense of Catholic practices (e.g., transubstantiation, omnipresent paintings and sculptures, lush music, clouds of incense, crucifixes with bloody Christs hanging from them) against Protestant insistence on spare surroundings and pure internality. It is also of a piece with the interest in lived physical experience that Stephen defines as Aristotelian, against the otherworldly abstractions of Platonism. His vivid pictures are not only an attempt to engage his listeners' imaginations. They are also a rejection of their inclination to respond to art as if all that matters is \"ideas, formless spiritual essences.\""

  "010119trinity": {
    "note": " The Christian doctrine of the Trinity, and in particular the theology of \"the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father,\" is crucial to Stephen's understanding of himself and his art. Both Telemachus and Proteus show him meditating on this relationship, and in Scylla and Charybdis he advances a reading of Shakespeare's Hamlet that relies upon what Haines calls “The Father and the Son idea. The Son striving to be atoned with the Father.” In this arcane personal mythology, Mulligan plays the part of a heretic, a modern representative of a \"brood of mockers\" who denied the mystery of the Trinity: Valentinus, Sabellius, Arius, and Photius.",
    "expandedNote": " One central mystery of Christian doctrine, Incarnation, reconciles the humanity and the divinity of Christ. Another, the Trinity, reconciles the divinity of Christ with the divinity of God. To early theologians Jesus of Nazareth was clearly different from the \"father\" in heaven whom he mentions or addresses often. But he was also divine, and in a monotheistic religion he must therefore be identical with the invisible God in heaven. This contradiction exercised the best minds of the early Christian church, and it doubtless troubles many believers still. (Nora Barnacle, who was more religious than her partner, nevertheless asked him in perplexity, “Jim, is Jesus and God the same?”) Ingenious theologians came up with a solution: Father and Son (and also Holy Spirit) are different Persons, but they are united in a single divine nature, or \"substance.\" \n The Trinitarian doctrine enshrined in the Nicene Creed was illustrated in the later Middle Ages in the image of a Scutum Fidei or Shield of Faith: a triangle showing that the Persons are distinct from one another but all the same God. Accompanying text often made clear that Father is not Son and Son is not Father, but both are God. \n Stephen thinks in Telemachus of four “heresiarchs” (great heretical leaders of the early church) that threatenedorthodox Trinitarian doctrine. The earliest of these, Valentinus, hails from the 2nd century, when the early church was only beginning to differentiate its teachings from those of the Gnostics. Gnosticism regarded the material world as evil, and described salvation as a matter of escaping that evil realm of matter. Although Valentinus thought of himself as a Christian, he was also a Gnostic, and taught that the world had been created not by God but by a quasi-Platonic Demiurge—a malevolent one. Christ came to liberate mankind from materiality, but since he was God, and good, he could not be thought to participate in any way in that materiality. He was therefore conceived as purely spiritual, not incarnate. Stephen thinks of “Valentine, spurning Christ’s terrene body” and thus breaking the Christological link between physical humanity and spiritual essence expressed in the doctrine of Incarnation.\n \"Sabellius,\" an influential theologian of the 3rd century about whom little is known today, opposed early Trinitarian thinking very directly. He denied the threefold quality of the deity absolutely, arguing that the persons were simply personae: masks, faces, external aspects. Human believers looked at the incarnate Son who was crucified and resurrected and saw something very different from the unapproachable Ancient of Days who had laid the foundations of heaven and earth. But in themselves these two Persons, and likewise the Holy Spirit, were simply one God who chose to manifest himself in different ways. \n By this logic, Tertullian objected, the Father could be said to have suffered on the cross just as the Son did, since they are essentially the same. Stephen, recalling the “Words Mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the stranger” (that Stephen “proves by algebra that Hamlet’s grandson is Shakespeare’s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own father”), muses wryly that the “subtle” Sabellius “held that the Father was Himself his own Son.” This probably makes Sabellius a bit more subtle that he actually was, since his point was simply to deny that the terms Father and Son named anything essential.\n \"Arius,\" who figures also in Proteus, lived in the late 3rd and early 4th centuries. He conceived the Persons of the Trinity in an essentially Neoplatonic manner, as hierarchically ranked processions. God the Father, “the only true God,” first created the Logos (the pre-incarnate Son) “out of things nonexistent.” The Logos similarly created the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit in turn created the material world. Arian teaching thus subordinated the Son to the Father. It was espoused by many of the Germanic tribes (Goths, Lombards, Vandals) and by many people within the Roman empire: ordinary believers, priests, bishops, nobles, even some emperors. \n The vigorous contest between Arianism and Trinitarianism was decisively resolved at the first council of Nicaea (325), which condemned Arianism as a heresy and promulgated the view that (in the words of the Nicene Creed) the Son was “begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father.” Originally written in Greek, the Creed used the word homoousion to indicate that Father and Son shared the same ousia or essential, immaterial being. The Greek term was translated into Latin as consubstantialem, meaning “of the same substance.” Stephen affirms this crucial element of the Nicene Creed when he thinks of Arius “warring his life long\" upon the doctrine of consubstantiality. \n The Holy Spirit was not so central as the Father and Son to the early church’s theological bridging of heaven and earth, but the ways in which people conceived of it in relation to the other two Persons proved crucial in the second half of the 9th century, when the Catholic and Orthodox churches began to pull apart from one another. \"Photius\" is regarded in the eastern churches as a great father who defended traditional doctrine from a Roman heresy. In the west he is viewed as an arch-heretic. As Thornton notes, the Catholic Encyclopedia describes him as \"one of the worst enemies the Church of Christ ever had.\" \n The schism that formally separated these two great branches of Christianity in 1054 had deep roots stretching back to the division of the Roman empire and the collapse of the western half. As Patriarch of Constantinople, Photius opposed the Pope in Rome over questions of political authority and also over Rome’s effort to add a single word to the Nicene Creed, filioque (“and from the Son”). This word had been circulating for several centuries in the west, and the Romans wanted the creed amended to make clear that the Holy Spirit proceeds both “from the Father and from the Son.” The Greeks in Constantinople, relying on the creed as written, affirmed that the Spirit proceeds from the Father alone. From Stephen’s perspective, the Orthodox position is regrettable because it accords primacy to the Father, whereas Catholic doctrine affirms the potency of Father and Son equally.\n Telemachus identifies Stephen symbolically with Telemachus and Hamlet, two unhappy sons devoted to absent fathers. Like Hamlet and Telemachus, Jesus was a young man in the familiar human world whose life had meaning in relationship to a ghostly, absent father. This relationship suggests how human life might be made to express spiritual possibilities—a central concern of Stephen’s aesthetics.\n JH 2011"

  "030096contransmag": {
    "note": " In a book chock-full of neologistic compounds, one stands alone: \"contransmagnificandjewbangtantiality.\" Stephen elaborates wildly on the Nicene \"consubstantiality\" opposed by Arius, to produce a word that has elicited much comment. Joseph Campbell, in particular, has inspired many people to read the word as a key to the novel's theological mysteries, conveying eastern religious ideas of the radical immanence of divinity and the mystical unity of subject and object. But popular nonsensical versions of the word long antedate Joyce, calling into question such ambitious readings.",
    "expandedNote": " Between con- and -substantiality intrudes the prefix \"trans.\" This may be a reference to Arius' belief that the Father \"made\" the Son, rather than \"begetting\" him as the Nicene Creed would have it. In Arian doctrine the Father is essentially different from, and superior to, the Son. He transcends him—is transubstantial rather than consubstantial. \n Alternatively, following Campbell, \"trans\" might be read as referring to transubstantiation, the Catholic doctrine that bread and wine become miraculously changed into the body and blood of Christ during the sacrament of the Eucharist. By this reading, \"trans\" and \"con\" would not negate one another as Arian and Nicene Christology do. Consubstantiality and transubstantiation both involve sharing divine substance (between Father and Son, and between Christ and the eucharistic meal), so the prefixes would intensify one another, pointing toward the novel's preoccupation with metempsychosis, transpersonal identification, and the coincidence of opposites. \n The next segment, \"magnific,\" recalls the Magnificat, a very ancient church hymn based on the words that the Virgin Mary utters when Elizabeth says, \"Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb\": \"And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord, And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour. For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed. For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is his name\" (Luke 1:42, 46-49). In Latin, magnificare means to esteem or prize highly. When Mary says that her soul magnifies the Lord, she evidently means something like \"manifests his greatness\"—it is God's greatness, not her own, that she celebrates. \n But one could infer that Mary has become magnificent, as she certainly did in later Catholic practice. For Campbell, \"My soul doth magnify the Lord\" signifies that \"God is within me,\" and this refers \"not solely to the condition of the Mother of God, two thousand years ago in Judea, but to every one of us, here and now\" (Mythic World, Modern Words, 80). Magnificat signifies the interpenetration of self and other proclaimed in the Sanskrit saying \"tat tvam asi\" (thou art that). Divinity, argues Campbell, does not lie outside of human nature and history; it is radically immanent in all people at all times.\n The implications of the next word, \"jew,\" seem relatively straightforward. Jesus was a Jew. When God took on human flesh, he came here as a Jew. And yet he was rejected by his own people, leading many Christians through the ages to accuse the Jews of killing their Lord. Leopold Bloom walks through the novel as the object of such anti-Semitic suspicions, but he demonstrates Christ-like qualities of generosity and compassion and offers spiritual assistance to Stephen. Although Stephen probably is not thinking of Bloom when he coins his big word, it may anticipate the union of the two men, who as Father-Son and \"jewgreek\" exemplify the kinds of union of opposites implied by Campbell's tat tvam asi.\n By contrast, the word \"bang\" seems open to various interpretations. Sticking narrowly to the theological disputes that Stephen is pondering, Gifford says that it \"suggests both the controversial origin of Christianity and the sustained controversy over Arianism.\" But the association of God with explosive power could also support Campbell's idea of immanent divinity. In Nestor, when Stephen is confronted with the headmaster's traditional teleological idea of \"the manifestation of God\" at the end of time, he points toward the hubbub of the hockey game and says, \"That is God . . . A shout in the street.\" For Stephen, creative and destructive power is immanent in all things. He is terrified by a thunderclap in Oxen of the Sun because, like his creator Joyce, he hears the voice of God in thunder. \n (Another possibility would be to hear a reference to the divine insemination of Mary, of whom Mulligan has sung \"My mother's a jew.\" As a slang word for the sexual act, \"bang\" seems to be mostly a creature of the 20th century, but it has some much older precedents. In a personal communication, Vincent Altman O'Connor cites a usage in Aphra Behn's play The Rover: \"No, no, Gentlewoman, come along, adsheartlikins we must be better acquainted—we’ll both lie with her, and then let me alone to bang her.\")\n Stitching together some of the variant readings offered in this note, one could conclude that \"contransmagnificandjewbangtantiality\" represents simply a condensation of some arcane early Christology, or that it compresses essential elements of the novel's post-Christian metaphysics. \n [2017] But commentators have also found various forms of a popular 19th century jaw-breaker that must have been the genesis of Joyce's word. In a short survey article on James Joyce Online Notes John Simpson suggests that Joyce could have encountered the word either in the writings of the early 19th century Irish poet James Clarence Mangan, whom he revered, or in popular contemporary venues like spelling bees, songs, and pantomimes. Words like \"transmagnificanbandancial\" and \"transmagnificandubandanciality,\" which carried little more sense than the 20th century \"supercalifragilisticexpialidocious,\" originated at least as early as the 1830s, possibly in America, and survived and evolved for many decades. Joyce appears to have grafted the Christian \"consubstantiality\" onto this existing rootstock. He may well have found various kinds of theological significance inherent within it, but the word's silly origins should perhaps discourage excessively solemn interpretations."

  "010029coronation": {
    "note": " \"Coronation Day\" is a drinking song that was sung in English streets in 1902, during the months of anticipation leading up to the coronation of King Edward VII. Mulligan sings it \"out of tune with a cockney accent\" in Telemachus, and in Circe King Edward himself intones it \"with soft contentment.\"",
    "expandedNote": " Gifford notes that “coronation day” could also be “slang for payday because the pay could be reckoned incrowns (five-shilling pieces).” Just before this play on crowns, Mulligan has made a similar play on the name of the one-pound coins called sovereigns, celebrating the “Four omnipotent sovereigns” that Stephen will receive from his employer later in the morning. The power of these sovereigns, he figures, resides in their ability to procure alcoholic inebriation; hence his enthusiastic rendition of the drinking song."

  "020043corpses": {
    "note": " In Nestor and again in Proteus, Stephen thinks of the Ulster Protestants who harassed Catholic peasants in the 1780s and 90s. In the latter chapter, Kevin Egan is wearing what Stephen fancies to be \"his peep of day boy's hat\"—odd, since Egan was not an activist of that stripe. The Peep o' Day Boys were agrarian Protestants who staged raids on Catholic cottages in the early-morning hours. Eventually they were subsumed into the orange lodges. Stephen earlier has thought about a massacre that occurred at one of these lodges in 1795: \"The lodge of Diamond in Armagh the splendid behung with corpses of papishes.\"",
    "expandedNote": " The Peep of Day Boys initiated a campaign of ethnic cleansing, seeking to force Catholics out of County Armagh. Notices reproducing Oliver Cromwell's notorious phrase \"To Hell or Connaught\" were posted on the doors of homes with a date, and if the cottage was not evacuated by that date it would be burned down. Catholics organized a resistance organization called the Defenders, but many thousands of Catholics left the county in 1795 and 1796. When a group of mostly unarmed Defenders gathered at \"the lodge of Diamond\" on September 21, they were cut down by heavily armed Protestants. \n The organized resistance has allowed Protestants to remember the killings as a glorious victory over a threatening mob: in Orange Order lore they are memorialized as the Battle of the Diamond. In the Catholic cultural memory that Stephen is drawing on, the killings in Armagh were a massacre, and they hold much the same resonance that the 1972 Bloody Sunday massacre in Derry would later acquire. \n Thornton notes that \"Armagh the Splendid\" is \"a set phrase that goes back at least as far as Mangan's translation of 'Prince Alfrid's Itinerary through Ireland.'\""

    "expandedNote": " Bloom's muddled version: \"Because the weight of the water, no, the weight of the body in the water is equal to the weight of the what? Or is it the volume is equal to the weight?\" \n The relevant part of Archimedes' investigation of displacement holds that any solid body submerged in a fluid is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by that body, with the result that the body appears to weigh that much less. Because the waters of the Dead Sea contain an extraordinarily high percentage of dissolved salts, they weigh much more than water normally does, and human bodies float effortlessly. (Theoretically, a body that weighed enough could sink, but its apparent weight would still be lessened in proportion to the heavy water it displaced.)\n As with his speculations about the sun's rays in Calypso, Bloom is dimly recalling lessons he learned twenty years earlier, in a class that he now reflects on: \"Vance in High school cracking his fingerjoints, teaching. The college curriculum.\" He has forgotten the precise scientific principle, but he retains the basic concepts necessary for understanding why bodies float in the Dead Sea: the \"weight of the body in the water\" has some kind of equivalency with the \"weight of the water,\" and the weight of the water has something to do with its being \"thick with salt.\" Nor is he completely off the mark when he thinks, \"Or is it the volume is equal to the weight?\" Archimedes did reflect on the fact that the volume of displaced fluid is equal to the volume of an entirely submerged object, or to that portion of the volume of a partially submerged object which is below the surface, and clearly this volume will determine the displacement weight.\n Bloom's \"Couldn't sink if you tried\" extends his daydream about Ceylon, another exotic eastern locale where people can \"float about\" on \"big lazy leaves,\" not doing a lick of work and \"Too hot to quarrel.\" In a chapter where he is struggling to keep his head above water, unsinkability has the seductive beauty of a drug vision."

  "060005churchyard": {
    "note": " A famous poem from the middle of the 18th century, Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard, surfaces in characters' thoughts three times in Ulysses. Bloom thinks of it in Hades in his typical fumbling way, getting both the title and the author slightly wrong, but his thoughts suggest some appreciation of the poem's content. In Eumaeus he alludes less astutely to one of the elegy's best-known lines, and in Cyclops John Wyse Nolan too recites one of the poem's lines.",
    "expandedNote": " Walking through the Glasnevin cemetery and thinking of all the Dubliners who have passed on, Bloom recalls this meditative lyric that does the same thing: \"Eulogy in a country churchyard it ought to be that poem of whose is it Wordsworth or Thomas Campbell.\" The poem was written by Thomas Gray, and its actual title better suits its intent: a eulogy is a praise of someone who has died, while an elegy is a more general meditative lament for the dead. But Bloom seems to know that his title is wrong (\"it ought to be\"), and his guesses about the author show some literary discernment. William Wordsworth (1770-1850) and Scotsman Thomas Campbell (1777-1844) were born two or three generations after Gray (1716-1771), but anyone could be forgiven for supposing that Wordsworth wrote the \"Elegy.\" Although it predated the Lyrical Ballads (1799) by nearly half a century, Gray's 1751 poem strongly anticipated the Romantic poet's reverential wanderings in nature and his democratizing interest in ordinary men and women. As for Campbell, earlier in Hades Bloom has thought of a line from Lord Ullin's Daughter (1804), a ballad that poignantly grieves a death.\n Gray's thoughts chime with things that Bloom thinks in his own, more urban graveyard. As darkness falls on a bucolic landscape, the speaker of the elegy thinks about the people buried beneath the trees in a local churchyard. The fact that no great titles or accomplishments are recorded on their tombstones should not, he thinks, diminish appreciation of their lives: \n Oft did the harvest to their sickle yield, \n Their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke; \n How jocund did they drive their team afield! \n How bow'd the woods beneath their sturdy stroke! \n Let not Ambition mock their useful toil, \n Their homely joys, and destiny obscure; \n Nor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile \n The short and simple annals of the poor. \n The boast of heraldry, the pomp of pow'r, \n And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave, \n Awaits alike th' inevitable hour. \n The paths of glory lead but to the grave. \n It is quite possible, the speaker supposes, that \"Some mute inglorious Milton here may rest, / Some Cromwell guiltless of his country's blood.\" These people grew up in rural poverty, deprived of education and paths to social advancement, and their talents never found the way to praise. But like all human beings they valued their lives, felt connected to others, and hoped to be remembered well. The poem memorializing them has been written by a man who shares their obscure condition, \"A youth to Fortune and to Fame unknown.\"\n Bloom too is a negligible man, and his reflections just before he thinks of Gray's elegy show a similar concern with the hidden lives of ordinary people. As Joe Hynes and Jack Power wander off to revere the great Parnell, he looks around at all the lesser graves surmounted by icons of religious hope and thinks how poorly they represent the lives that have ended: \"Pray for the repose of the soul of. Does anybody really? Plant him and have done with him. Like down a coalshoot.\" These people wished to live on, and their lives had meaning enough on their own terms: \"Who passed away. Who departed this life. As if they did it of their own accord. Got the shove, all of them. Who kicked the bucket. More interesting if they told you what they were. So and So, wheelwright. I travelled for cork lino. I paid five shillings in the pound. Or a woman's with her saucepan. I cooked good Irish stew.\"\n In Eumaeus, Bloom thinks of a quatrain that continues the theme of people not making a mark in the busy world of public advancement:\n Far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife,\n Their sober wishes never learn'd to stray; \n Along the cool sequester'd vale of life \n They kept the noiseless tenor of their way. \n Thomas Hardy's first big success, Far From the Madding Crowd (1874, with revised editions in 1895 and 1901), maintained Gray's implicit contrast between an apparently idyllic countryside and the bleak struggles of the people who live in it. But Bloom thinks only of how lovely it can be to get away from the city for a few days: \"There were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home island, delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation, offering a plethora of attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around Dublin and its picturesque environs even, Poulaphouca to which there was a steam tram, but also farther away from the madding crowd in Wicklow, rightly termed the garden of Ireland...\"\n In Cyclops, as the Citizen heaps abuse on the English while Bloom and J. J. O'Molloy urge moderation, John Wyse Nolan tosses in a line from the Elegy: \"Full many a flower is born to blush unseen.\" He is remembering another of Gray's appreciations of unnoticed people:\n Full many a gem of purest ray serene, \n The dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear: \n Full many a flow'r is born to blush unseen, \n And waste its sweetness on the desert air. \n The purpose of the allusion is not perfectly clear. Most likely Nolan is seconding what the Citizen has just said, that European people take no notice of English people or their langauge: they are as insignificant to the civilized continent as Gray's country people are to urban elites. But it seems conceivable that he could be urging an opinion like those of Bloom and O'Molloy: England has produced some perfectly decent people, but their virtues are obscured by the imperialist warmongers that excite the Citizen's rage."

Gifford observes that in 1904 it \"seemed remote and agrarian to Dublin, and its inhabitants were regarded as country bumpkins.\" Carrick-on-Shannon, the largest town, is no more than a village by the standards of most counties. Fewer than 5,000 people live there today. Sited at a strategic ford on the River Shannon, it grew up as a market town hosting several annual fairs. In Eumaeus, Bloom indicts the provincial thinking of the barhounds of Cyclops who were enraged when he called Jesus a Jew: \"because mostly they appeared to imagine he came from Carrick-on-Shannon or somewhere about in the county Sligo.\" In this hyperbolic account, a fair-skinned and blue-eyed Savior stumbled out of the most unforeign, chastely Irish place imaginable.\n [2021: Checking the 1901 census records for Larry O'Rourke's building on a whim, Senan Molony has discovered that in that year an unmarried 22-year-old man named \"Patrick Mullherne,\" who was born in \"Carrick on Shannon, Leittrim,\" was living on the premises and working as a \"shop assistant.\" No doubt he had red hair. Mulhern or Mulherne (\"Leittrim\" leads one to suspect that either Larry O'Rourke or John Phillips, the census \"enumerator,\" had a habit of doubling consonants) does not appear in the 1911 census records, but presumably he may have still been living in the building in 1909, when Joyce visited Dublin and stayed with his friend J. F. Byrne at 7 Eccles Street. One can easily imagine Joyce having drinks in the corner pub while staying with Byrne, learning that the red-headed barman was from Country Leitrim, and including him, relatively anonymously, in the legion of Dubliners who populate the pages of Ulysses.]"

  "010056crackedlookingglass": {
    "note": " Stephen says bitterly, \"It is a symbol of Irish art. The cracked lookingglass of a servant.\" M. H. Abrams showed in a classic study that mirrors have long been regarded as symbols of art conceived classically as a faithful mimetic representation of external reality. Stephen's characterization of the mirror seems to suggest that faithful representation of reality is difficult within the confines of colonial subjection.",
    "expandedNote": " When he was living outside of Ireland, and struggling to get Dubliners into print, Joyce wrote to the publisher Grant Richards, “It is not my fault that the odour of ashpits and old weeds and offal hangs round my stories. I seriously believe that you will retard the course of civilization in Ireland by preventing the Irish people from having one good look at themselves in my nicely polished looking-glass” (Letters, 63-64). His book of stories, then, intends to show Caliban his face in a mirror. Seeing themselves represented unflatteringly may liberate the Irish from ignorance and complacency. Stephen has not yet managed to write anything like the searing but honest portrayal of external reality described in Joyce's letter to Richards, and in Telemachus the despondency that he feels being back in Dublin appears to include doubt that he can represent Ireland truly while living trapped within it. At the end of Aeolus, however, he resolves to attempt it.\n In James Joyce's Ulysses: A Study (1930), Stuart Gilbert noted an additional context for the image of a “cracked looking glass” that may complicate or even refute the foregoing reading. In The Decay of Lying (1889), Oscar Wilde uses the phrase to object to the notion that art mirrors external reality. Wilde espoused the Romantic belief in individual genius—the view that Abrams characterizes as a \"lamp.\" In this view, the genius of the artist is more valuable than what most human beings regard as reality. The fact that Stephen repeats Wilde's phrase verbatim, and the fact that Mulligan has just invoked another work by the same author, may recommend this anti-mimetic reading of the sentence."

  "010060cranlysarm": {
    "note": " As Mulligan is holding Stephen's arm and saying, \"I'm the only one that knows what you are. Why don't you trust me more?\" Stephen is thinking, \"Cranly's arm. His arm.\" He compares Mulligan's close approach to a very similar moment of physical closeness in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man that ended unhappily.",
    "expandedNote": " In the final section of the earlier novel, Stephen and his close friend Cranly engage in an odd dance of self-positioning. Part of the confrontation is intellectual: Cranly has listened to many of Stephen’s beliefs and theories, and now he roughly interrogates him, challenging his renunciation of the Catholic faith urged on him by his mother. Also at stake, however, is the nature and future of the friendship. Stephen is struck by the way Cranly talks about women:\n Yes. His face was handsome: and his body was strong and hard. He had spoken of a mother’s love. He felt then the sufferings of women, the weaknesses of their bodies and souls: and would shield them with a strong and resolute arm and bow his mind to them.\n Away then: it is time to go. A voice spoke softly to Stephen’s lonely heart, bidding him go and telling him that his friendship was coming to an end. Yes; he would go. He could not strive against another. He knew his part.\n A little later, “Cranly seized his arm and steered him round so as to head back towards Leeson Park,” pressing the arm “with an elder’s affection.” Stephen is “thrilled by his touch,” but affirms his determination to pursue his solitary vision, even if it means being utterly alone. This strikes “some deep chord” in Cranly, who wonders whether Stephen would choose “not to have any one person . . . who would be more than a friend, more even than the noblest and truest friend a man ever had.” Stephen asks him, “Of whom are you speaking?” and Cranly does not answer. \n Whether or not one reads homoerotic interest into the two men’s probing of each other's intents (there is nothing overtly sexual in either’s words or thoughts), it is clear that Stephen wants something more than simple companionship, and that Cranly is possibly interested in supplying it. Joyce placed extravagant burdens of loyalty on his close friends in his university days, and these friendships did not last long or end well. Shortly after breaking with John Francis Byrne, the model for Cranly, Joyce met Oliver Gogarty, the model for Mulligan. Stephen does not respond to Mulligan's touch with the “thrill” that greeted Cranly’s. On the contrary, he seems to scorn Mulligan’s embrace."

She is almost certainly Ireland, in the ardently nationalistic person of the Shan Van Vocht.",
    "expandedNote": " In A Portrait of the Artist, when his friend Davin says that \"man's country comes first, Ireland first,\" Stephen replies, \"Do you know what Ireland is? Ireland is the old sow that eats her farrow.\" He is not speaking only of his countrymen's small-minded religious and cultural intolerance, but of their complicity in subjugation: \"My ancestors threw off their language and took another, Stephen said. They allowed a handful of foreigners to subject them. . . . No honourable and sincere man . . . has given up to you his life and his youth and his affections from the days of Tone to those of Parnell but you sold him to the enemy or failed him in need or reviled him and left him for another.\"\n In Circe the cannibalistic old sow and the jealous old queen morph into \"Old Gummy Granny,\" who appears \"seated on a toadstool, the deathflower of the potato blight on her breast.\" Stephen says, \"Aha! I know you, gammer! Hamlet, revenge! The old sow that eats her farrow!\" Granny turns out to be a demented religious patriot who urges Stephen to die a martyr's death. With two murderous British soldiers threatening him with bodily harm, she urges him to join in the game: \"(Thrusts a dagger towards Stephen's hand.) Remove him, acushla. At 8.35 a.m. you will be in heaven and Ireland will be free. (She prays.) O good God, take him!\"\n In Ulysses as in A Portrait, Stephen rejects the idea that he belongs to something called Ireland. \"Ireland,\" he says in Eumaeus, \"must be important because it belongs to me.\""

  "010115creed": {
    "note": " Having just named the “holy Roman catholic and apostolic church“ as one of his two overbearing masters, Stephen thinks of the source of these \"proud potent titles\" in the Nicene Creed of 325 AD: “et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam,” one holy catholic and apostolic church.",
    "expandedNote": " Creeds are formal statements of religious faith, beginning with the word Credo, \"I believe.\" They were designed to distinguish orthodoxy (correct belief) from heresy (false teaching). As Stephen acknowledges when he thinks of \"the slow growth and change of rite and dogma,\" orthodox doctrine develops gradually over the course of time, choosing between competing visions of the truth. This was especially true in the first few centuries of the Christian tradition.\n One particular kind of “growth and change” lay behind the Nicene Creed; it was formulated to counter the teachings of Arius, by articulating a particular conception of the relation between Father and Son. The creed's proud potent titles soon send Stephen’s thoughts into a triumphal fantasy of the archangel Michael casting out a flock of heretics, Arius among them. He associates the evolution of orthodoxy in Church teaching with the artistic development of his own intensely serious and “rare thoughts,” and links Mulligan’s unserious mockery with heresy. Stephen thinks particularly of heretical offenses against the Nicene Creed's account of Father and Son. His reasons for doing so become clear in Scylla and Charybdis, where he articulates an aesthetic theory built on the idea of Father-Son unity.\n This strong imaginative identification with the Catholic Church may seem strange, since Stephen has just identified that church as an overbearing master that he wants to throw off. But he has his own, purely artistic reasons for the loyalty. Ellmann says of Joyce in his young adult years, \"Christianity had subtly evolved in his mind from a religion into a system of metaphors, which as metaphors could claim his fierce allegiance. His brother Stanislaus's outward rebellion, which took the form of rudeness to his masters at Belvedere and defiance at home—his atheism worn like a crusader's cross—did not enlist James's sympathy. He preferred disdain to combat. He was no longer a Christian himself; but he converted the temple to new uses instead of trying to knock it down, regading it as a superior kind of human folly\" (66). \n J. S. Bach’s musical setting of the Nicene Creed in the Mass in B minor can be heard in the clip at right."

  "050041cricket": {
    "note": " Near the end of Lotus Eaters, as Bloom walks past College Park at the southeastern corner of Trinity College, he thinks of \"cricket.\" Irish people began playing this English sport in the 18th century—the first recorded match took place in 1792 between British troops and an all-Ireland team—and it retains some popularity today. In 1904 the Gaelic Athletic Association despised it as a \"garrison game,\" popular with British soldiers and the wealthy Protestant Ascendancy class whose interests they guarded, and was waging an aggressive campaign to make people choose between such foreign sports and native ones like hurling. But Bloom is drawn to the slow, thoughtful pace of the game. (George Bernard Shaw brilliantly remarked that \"The English are not very spiritual people, so they invented cricket to give them some idea of eternity.\")",
    "expandedNote": " At the end of Lotus Eaters Bloom characterizes cricket as a tranquil pastime unsuited to the impulsive, violent character of the Irish. As he walks past \"the gate of college park\" (the entrance to the College Park cricket ground on the south side of Trinity College, an Anglo-Irish bastion), he thinks, \"Heavenly weather really. If life was always like that. Cricket weather. Sit around under sunshades. Over after over. Out. They can't play it here. Duck for six wickets. Still Captain Buller broke a window in the Kildare street club with a slog to square leg. Donnybrook fair more in their line.\" His soft associations with the game (beautiful weather, lolling about waiting for something to happen) seem roughly consistent with those of Stephen Dedalus in part 1 ofA Portrait of the Artist as Young Man. Stephen clearly has played cricket, but he never thinks about his athletic efforts. Instead, as a young boy at Clongowes Wood College he meditates on \"the sounds of the cricket bats through the soft grey air\" as other boys practice. \"They said: pick, pack, pock, puck: little drops of water in a fountain slowly falling in the brimming bowl.\"\n Cricket is a subtle game whose intricacies lie beyond the ken of this commentator, but Bloom thinks about fairly routine actions. The bowler (equivalent to the pitcher in American baseball) delivers the ball from one \"wicket\" (three stakes set in the ground closely enough that the ball cannot pass between them) to a batsman standing in front of another wicket at the end of a long \"pitch.\" The batsman tries to keep the bowled ball from hitting the wicket behind him, and to drive it far enough away that he can run to the other end of the pitch without being put \"Out.\" The fielding team can put a batsman out in several different ways, including hitting his wicket with the bowled ball, catching his hit ball on the fly, and hitting a wicket with the ball before he reaches the other end of the pitch. Any of these actions ends the \"wicket,\" here doubling (confusingly) as a term for the at-bat session. Wickets also end after a set number of bowls. When the bowler has delivered six \"fair balls,\" the umpire signals the completion of an \"over,\" and a different player bowls a new \"over\" from the opposite wicket—hence \"Over after over.\"\n Running one full length of the pitch scores a run, and cricket scores are typically very high because multiple runs can be scored in any one wicket. A batsman who scores no runs before being put out is said to be \"bowled for a duck.\" Bloom thinks of six batsmen in a row being thus shut out: \"Duck for six wickets.\" Gifford remarks that \"It would be an extraordinary feat for a bowler to accomplish 'six wickets,' six outs in sequence, in that fashion.\" So when Bloom imagines this long scoreless stretch just after thinking, \"They can't play it here,\" he seems to be attributing ignominious performance to Irish batsmen.\n But the final detail in Bloom's revery offers a parallactic And-Yet to his judgment that the Irish are not very good at cricket: \"Still Captain Buller broke a window in the Kildare street club with a slog to square leg.\" A \"slog\" is a hard hit, like the \"slugging\" of power hitters in American baseball, and \"square leg\" is a defensive position occupied by one of the ten fielders, due left of the batsman (\"square\" to the axis of the pitch). Like a hard-hit foul ball in baseball, Buller's powerful shot has left the cricket ground, crossed the college wall and South Leinster Street, and slammed into the Kildare Street Club an impressive distance away. \n Various stories of powerful shots over South Leinster Street or Nassau Street (they meet near the club) circulated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many of them involving batsmen not named Buller (or for that matter Culler, Gabler's proposed emendation). But John Simpson observes, in a note onJames Joyce Online Notes, that \"Dublin was bristling with Captain Bullers in the second half of the nineteenth century.\" An Irish-born cricketer named Charles Francis Buller, \"in his youth widely regarded as one of the most promising young batsmen of his generation,\" may have been the inspiration for Bloom's story. Another possibility is one Frederick Charles Buller-Yarle-Buller, but he was apparently English, and known more as a bowler than a batsman. \n In Eumaeus the narrator reflects that the evening newspaper being passed around the cabstand may contain accounts of \"the exploits of King Willow, Iremonger having made a hundred and something second wicket not out for Notts.\" The focus here has shifted to cricket matches being played in England. In fact, as Gifford notes, the 16 June 1904 issue of the Evening Telegraph did report (page 3, column 6) \"the day's progress of a match between the county teams of Nottingham and Kent: at the end of the day Iremonger, the Notts star batsman who had started the game, was still at bat having scored 155 runs with the loss of only two wickets (i.e., two of Iremonger's batting partners had been put out). The Notts total for two wickets: 290.\" James Iremonger was a right-handed batsman for the Notts County team who hit spectacular numbers of runs every year from 1901 to 1906, and especially in the summer of 1904. The narrator calls him \"King Willow\" because cricket bats were made from willow wood. This example of how English greats can play the game no doubt stands in implied contrast to Bloom's judgment that \"They can't play it here.\"\n Bloom has apparently been a fan of cricket throughout his adult life. In Penelope Molly recalls him in the days of their courtship \"standing at the corner of the Harolds cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in the Zingari colours.\" Citing Patrick Hone's Cricket in Ireland (1956), Slote observes that the Zingari were \"an amateur cricket club with no home pitch, and thus a 'nomadic' club\" (Zingari is Italian for gypsies). The colors worn on their club caps were \"green, purple and pink with alternating yellow stripes.\""

  "020046croppiesdown": {
    "note": " \"Croppies lie down\" is an Orange song dating from the time of the 1798 rebellion, its name referring to the close-cropped hair of the rebels (like that of the revolutionaries in France, and unlike the powdered wigs of the British and Anglo-Irish ruling classes). The song depicts the Catholic rebels as cowardly traitors, and mockingly revels in their defeat by brave loyalists.",
    "expandedNote": " The rebels of the 1790s looked to America and France for inspiration, given the revolutions that had recently taken place in both countries. Their leadership came from a group called the Society of United Irishmen, a group of Protestant liberals in Belfast who welcomed Catholic members and dissenters and advocated for Catholic emancipation, but whose reform efforts were effectively blocked in the Irish Parliament. When war broke out between Britain and France in 1793, the Society was forced underground. It made common cause with the Catholic agrarian group called the Defenders, gained members across Ireland (200-300,000, nearly 5% of the population), and turned to the revolutionary goal of getting England out of Ireland. In 1796 Theobald Wolfe Tone, the Society's leader, traveled to France and secured promises of an invasion force. But the Expédition d'Irlande, a fleet of ships with 14,000 seasoned French troops and heavy stocks of war matériel, could not land at Bantry Bay in bad weather in 1796, and returned home. Tone, who was with the force, said that \"England has had its luckiest escape since the Armada.\" Much smaller French efforts were made to help the rebellion that finally took place in 1798.\n In contrast to the Shan Van Vocht, written at about the same time, which proclaims that \"The French are in the bay, and the Orange will decay,\" Croppies Lie Down ridicules the French:\n Should France e'er attempt, by fraud or by guile,\n Her forces to land upon Erin's green isle,\n We'll show that they ne'er can make free soldiers slaves,\n They shall only possess our green fields for their graves;\n Our country's applauses our triumphs will crown,\n Whilst with their French brothers the croppies lie down."

A large cross is made by touching some or all of one's fingers successively to forehead, chest, left shoulder and right shoulder. Smaller crosses can be made by touching forehead, lips, and chest, or in the air facing away from the signer. The action is typically paired with silent or spoken recitation of the words “In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.\"",
    "expandedNote": " Thrilled by Haines' news that the milkwoman is on her way (\"The blessings of God on you!\"), Mulligan speaks the verbal formula in Telemachus as he blesses the breakfast he is slapping down on three plates: \"In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti.\" (Grammatically, the genitive \"Spiritui Sancti\" should be used for the Holy Spirit, but Spiritus is heard frequently in liturgical settings.) The sign of the cross is often used in sanctifying things like church fonts, but seldom for ham and eggs. It can also bless persons and accompany prayers.\n When the priest in Lotus Eaters turns to the congregation and blesses his kneeling parishioners, \"All crossed themselves and stood up.\" In Wandering Rocks Father Conmee \"crossed his breast\" while reciting the prayers in his breviary. In Telemachus Mulligan \"crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips and breastbone,\" his gesture in this instance intended to communicate a piece of social information to Stephen and Haines: the man exiting the swimming hole is a priest."

  "030070crosstrees": {
    "note": " As Stephen looks over his shoulder and sees the disembodied threemaster glide past him, he notices that her sails are \"brailed up on the crosstrees.\" He is hardly employing nautical terminology. The conjunction of the words cross and tree, and the fact that there are three of them, infers an allusion to the Crucifixion. Jesus was crucified between two thieves, and Christians have frequently referred to the cross on which he hung as a \"tree,\" opposing its salvific power to the tree in Eden that brought death to mankind. The crucifixion symbolism has significance for Stephen much as it did for Gabriel Conroy at the end of \"The Dead.\"",
    "expandedNote": " Stephen has repeatedly pondered images of death in the third episode: a dead fetus in a bag, the \"ghostwoman with ashes on her breath,\" the remnants of the \"lost Armada,\" \"crucified shirts\" and \"Human shells,\" a post office doorman blown to bits by a shotgun, prison walls and tenements blown up by gunpowder, waves of murderous Vikings, a shoal of beached whales, the \"Houses of decay\" evoked by Guido Cavalcanti, a drowning man, the rotting body of a dog, a drowned man. But near the end of the chapter he has been thinking intensively of the benign aspects of death: resurrection as for Milton's Lycidas, transfiguration as in Ariel's song, reincarnation in his cycle of life forms, welcome release in the mildness of \"Seadeath.\" The evocation of Calvary in the final sentence joins these trains of thought in balanced opposition. Crucifixion suggests both the cruel certainty of extinction and hope for some kind of resurrection.\n Joyce had already played with such ambiguities at the end of \"The Dead,\" the concluding story of Dubliners. As Gabriel Conroy swoons into fantasies of joining the dead, he thinks of snow falling on \"the lonely churchyard on the hill where Michael Furey lay buried. It lay thickly drifted on the crosses and headstones, on the spears of the little gate, on the barren thorns.\" The details in these sentences unmistakably evoke the hill of Calvary, the crosses on which three men died, the spears of the Roman soldiers, and the thorns of Christ's crown. But do Gabriel's thoughts represent a capitulation to insignificance, or a revelation of the possibility of redemption? Joyce leaves the fate of his protagonist sublimely uncertain, while embuing it with mythic potential. The story ends with snow falling \"like the descent of their last end, upon all the living and the dead.\" \n Throughout Ulysses, Stephen is seen slipping into a recapitulation of his father's dissolute existence, and simultaneously positioning himself to be reborn. The narrative does not indicate which trajectory may ultimately prevail. Here at the end of the Telemachiad, the symbol attached to Gabriel at the end of \"The Dead\" is repurposed, to express both the despair and hope of Stephen's life."

  "030153crouched": {
    "note": " For a person who did not much like dogs, Joyce represented them skillfully in his novel. The three paragraphs describing the cocklepickers' dog in Proteus display masterfully close observation, undiminished by Stephen's frequent metaphysical intrusions and the narrative's even more frequent evocations of other animal forms (hare, buck, bear, wolf, calf, fox, pard, panther, vulture). Most of the actions in these paragraphs make immediate visual sense, but one of them, \"crouched in flight,\" is odd enough to give a reader pause.",
    "expandedNote": " In an article titled \"James Joyce's Bloom: The Mongrel Imagery,\" in American Imago 42.1:39-43 (1985), Joanne Rey writes of how the dog responds to its master's \"blunt bootless kick\": \"The kick is brutal; the dog's cowardice is reflected in the intransitives 'sulk' and 'slink'. 'Flight' instead of 'fright' is also appropriate in this context. Although the animal is not physically harmed, the animal fears potential harm from its master\" (39). The effect would be less startling if Joyce had written \"crouched in fright\"—that combination of words is almost a cliché—but how, one may ask, is it appropriate to describe the dog \"crouched in flight\"?\n A perfectly sensible answer is implied by the colloquial image of an animal retreating \"with its tail between its legs.\" From fear of injury, and also probably to display submission, a dog that has been physically intimidated will lower its head and ears, curve its spine so as to draw its rear legs close to the front ones, and tuck its tail down far between its legs. This flight posture could well be described as a \"crouch.\" \n Appropriately for someone who is terrified of dogs (he carries an ashplant to ward them off) and who also identifies with them (the dog on the beach makes him think that Mulligan has called him a dogsbody, and his fear is followed by a determination to \"Respect his liberty. You will not be master of others or their slave\"), Stephen has the same word applied to him in Oxen of the Sun when the thunderclap overawes him: \"But the braggart boaster cried that an old Nobodaddy was in his cups it was muchwhat indifferent and he would not lag behind his lead. But this was only to dye his desperation as cowed he crouched in Horne’s hall.\""

  "040093cuckstool": {
    "note": " The morpheme \"cuck\" appears in several different guises in Ulysses. The book refers repeatedly to cuckolds and the cuckoo bird whose call taunts unhappy spouses. But the \"cuckstool\" in Bloom's privy brings in a different, scatological significance. This excremental meaning surfaces again, combined with the theme of sexual humiliation, in Bella Cohen's memories of her husband \"Cuck Cohen.\"",
    "expandedNote": " In late medieval and early modern Europe, overly talkative women and dishonest tradesmen were punished by being tied to a \"cuckstool\" or \"cucking stool\" that was either ducked in a pond or river or set where passersby could jeer and throw things, as with the similar practice of placing malefactors in the \"pillory\" or \"stocks.\" Joyce's commentators have typically assumed that the use of the word in Calypso refers to this medieval punishment—an allusion which would suggest that the representation of Bloom's defecation is designed to humble him. Such echoes may play a minor role, but the cucking stool has an older, simpler, and much more obviously relevant meaning: \"shitting chair.\"\n The American Heritage Dictionary translates the Middle English cucking stol as \"excreting stool,\" tracing its etymology to the verb cukken, \"to defecate.\" The dictionary's appendix of Indo-European roots identifies kakka- or kaka- as the ultimate source of the Old Norse kūka and the Latin cacāre, both meaning \"to defecate,\" and the Greek kakos, \"bad.\" In a personal communication, Vincent Van Wyk notes that in Dutch-speaking countries the homophonic kakstoel (kakis pronounced \"cuck\") still refers to chairs or boxes containing a chamberpot beneath a hole. Today kakstoels are used only for toilet-training young children, but in 1904, when ceramic flush toilets were only beginning to take over (Thomas Twyford invented them in 1870, and Thomas Crapper began to patent various designs soon after), such close-stools would have been found all over Europe.\n Van Wyk supposes that, since Bloom thinks of a king in his counting house just as he sits down, his outhouse may contain such a throne—a more elegant fixture that a middle-class wife would probably demand—rather than just a rough board with a hole. Such an inference must remain speculative, but this meaning of \"cuckstool\" makes much better literal sense of the scene presented in Calypso. It also explains why the word \"cuck\" would show up again in Circe surrounded with mentions of privies, shit, and anality. Bella Cohen, transformed into the dominating Bello, informs Bloom that she will bury him in the whorehouse cesspool along with her many husbands:\n We’ll bury you in our shrubbery jakes where you’ll be dead and dirty with old Cuck Cohen, my stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and sodomite with a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands, whatever the buggers’ names were, suffocated in the one cesspool. (He explodes in a loud phlegmy laugh.) We’ll manure you, Mr Flower! \n If a reader also hears echoes of cuckoldry and its attendant humiliation in the name \"Cuck Cohen,\" so much the better (or worse). Bella/o goes through husbands like toilet paper and disposes of them in a manner suiting their sexual degradation."

  "130005cuckoo": {
    "note": " The \"Cuckoo\" sounds that conclude Nausicaa come from a \"clock on the mantelpiece in the priest's house\" next to the Star of the Sea church, and their number tells the time of day, 9 PM. But the word also recalls a Shakespearean song referenced by Buck Mulligan in Scylla and Charybdis in which \"Cuckoo\" is a \"word of fear\" to married men, betokening sexual betrayal. The clock's call performs that significance for the listening Bloom, just as the melody of St. George's bells earlier became a nursery rhyme in his ears while telling the time.",
    "expandedNote": " The words \"cuckold\" (male) and \"cuckquean\" (female) are derived from \"cuckoo,\" probably because some cuckoo species lay their eggs in the nests of other birds, tricking those strangers into expending energy on the survival of offspring genetically foreign to them. (To make matters worse, cuckoo hatchlings often roll the genuine eggs out of the nest, killing off their competitors.) The analogy does not seem ever to have been very exact, as the cuckoo benefits from such deception while its human equivalents suffer from it: the cuckold is like the tricked bird, investing energy in raising offspring not his own, and the cuckquean is tied to a male who sows his genes like wild oats and cannot be depended on to provide for her young. But the superficial resemblance was enough to inspire a vibrant addition to the English language. According to the American Heritage Dictionary, the French and Middle English cuccu (a name apparently imitative of the familiar two-note call now used in cuckoo clocks) morphed into the Norman French cucuald and the Middle English cukeweld and cokewold. (In France, a cuckold is simply a cocu.)\n Shakespeare, whose decades-long preoccupation with sexual infidelity birthed an endless string of agonized utterances about cuckolds and the horns that grow from their foreheads (a separate story), understood the linkage between these words. When Stephen says that \"His unremitting intellect is the hornmad Iago ceaselessly willing that the moor in him shall suffer,\" Mulligan quotes from one of his plays: \"— Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuck Mulligan clucked lewdly. O word of fear!\" He is recalling one of two remarkable songs at the end of Love's Labour's Lost, performed by men playing Spring and Winter who imitate respectively the calls of the cuckoo and the owl. In the spring song, the cuckoo's call evokes cuckoldry:\n When daisies pied, and violets blue,\n And lady-smocks all silver-white,\n And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue\n Do paint the meadows with delight,\n The cuckoo then on every tree\n Mocks married men; for thus sings he,\n \"Cuckoo;\n Cuckoo, cuckoo\"—O word of fear,\n Unpleasing to a married ear!\n When shepherds pipe on oaten straws,\n And merry larks are ploughmen's clocks;\n When turtles tread, and rooks and daws,\n And maidens bleach their summer smocks,\n The cuckoo then on every tree\n Mocks married men; for thus sings he,\n \"Cuckoo;\n Cuckoo, cuckoo\"—O word of fear,\n Unpleasing to a married ear!\n Instead of perching a live bird on a blossoming tree, Joyce inserts a mechanical bird into his text. But its call is the same, and a married man is lying nearby to hear it. What's good for the cuckquean is good for the cuckold, of course: Bloom has spent the first part of Nausicaa engaging in virtual sex with a young woman who is not his wife, in the venerable tradition of middle-aged male infidelity: \"Chance. We'll never meet again. But it was lovely. Goodbye, dear. Thanks. Made me feel so young.\" Nevertheless, the notes sounding in his ears are fearful ones, and the narrative takes pains to call attention to his sad state: \"Because it was a little canarybird bird that came out of its little house to tell the time that Gerty MacDowell noticed the time she was there because she was as quick as anything about a thing like that, was Gerty MacDowell, and she noticed at once that that foreign gentleman that was sitting on the rocks looking was /Cuckoo.\" The sound suffuses the evening air with melancholy."

    "note": " Stephen came back from Paris with several light entertainment magazines stuffed in his pockets. \"Le Tutu\" and, even more, the \"five tattered numbers of Pantalon Blanc et Culotte Rouge\" offered risqué reading which the conservative arbiters of French fashion were endeavoring to suppress. The magazines' preoccupation with sex and with female undergarments link Stephen with James Joyce and with Leopold Bloom.",
    "expandedNote": " Le Tutu was a weekly entertainment magazine founded in 1901. La Vie en Culotte Rouge (Life in Red Breeches) followed in 1902, its title referring to the pants worn by French soldiers. Thornton found both weeklies listed in the \"Humoristiques\" section of the 1904-5 Annuaire de la Presse Française.\n John Simpson notes on the James Joyce Online Notes website that La Vie en Culotte Rouge was \"mildly erotic, and was clearly the sort of magazine that might have been attractive to Joyce’s eclectic taste. It presented the adventures of amorous military types and their easy-going lady friends.\" He observes that \"Conservative French opinion was not in favour of a magazine lavishly illustrated with sketches of near-naked ladies, whatever their artistic quality. The publishers came under strong pressure to withdraw it. It eventually ceased publishing in 1912, but not before the revealing illustrations had been severely toned down. As late as 1928 the magazine was still on a list (alongside Le Tutu) consisting of 'titres des ouvrages contraires aux bonnes mœurs' and not sold in respectable bookshops.\" \n The longer title Pantalons Blancs et Culottes Rouges that appears in Proteus (though with its plurals misremembered as singulars) came from a collection of ten issues of La Vie en Culotte Rouge. Simpson reports that the publishers of the weekly decided, as a marketing ploy, to repackage its issues in bound volumes. The first ten weekly issues were sold together as Mars et Vénus, emphasizing even more than did the weekly title the encounters of the warrior class with the fair sex. The next ten followed suit under the title Le Cœur et l’Épée (The Heart and the Sword). Episodes 21 through 30 appeared as Poudre à Canon et Poudre de Riz (Gunpowder and Ricepowder). Episodes 31 through 40 were repackaged as Pantalons Blancs et Culottes Rouges (White Undies and Red Trousers).\n The young Joyce left Paris one month before this fourth bound volume was first advertised and sold in May 1903, but he could have encountered it during later trips to Paris. Since the \"five tattered numbers\" pretty clearly refer to individual issues, he appears to have confused their title with that of the bound album.\n The frilly white undergarments of the ladies in Le Tutu and La Vie en Culotte Rouge clearly invite readers to relate Stephen's sexual proclivities to those of Bloom. It also seems possible that the red pants of the soldiers bear some connection to the red pants that Molly wears in Bloom's dream—as the image at right may suggest."

  "040044curate": {
    "note": " In the pubs of Joyce's time, a \"curate\" was a bartender. The name comes from the Catholic church, and puns on the notion of being a servant or server.",
    "expandedNote": " The Catholic church delivers the cure animarum, the cure or care of souls. A curate is a person charged with this responsibility, so parish priests are often called curates, as in the French title curé. But in England and Ireland the term typically refers to priests who assist the parish priest—junior members of the profession, assistants to the celebrants of the Mass.\n In Calypso Bloom imagines Larry O'Rourke \"watching the aproned curate swab up with mop and bucket,\" and then thinks of these employees \"Coming up redheaded curates from the county Leitrim, rinsing empties and old man in the cellar. Then, lo and behold, they blossom out as Adam Findlaters or Dan Tallons.\" The analogy between a clerical vocation and a career in alcohol-delivery is clear: pay your dues, faithfully serve the mother-institution, and before too long you can have your own establishment.\n In Lestrygonians Bloom is respectfully addressed as \"sir\" by the \"curate\" in Davy Byrne's, who serves Bloom his cheese sandwich and glass of burgundy. Davy Byrne himself chats with his customers, but does not do the serving."

  "070017dailyexpress": {
    "note": " The Daily Express, or \"the Express,\" was a morning newspaper of very conservative political orientation published in Dublin from 1851 to 1921. It plays a miniscule role in Ulysses, but that one passing moment of interest raises interesting questions about Joyce's earlier writings. In Aeolus Bloom thinks he has heard that J. J. O'Molloy \"does some literary work for the Expresswith Gabriel Conroy,\" which sends the reader back to a charged moment in The Dead. Conroy's involvement with the Express, in turn, demands to be situated within the context of Joyce's own writing for that newspaper.",
    "expandedNote": "Throughout its history, which terminated shortly before the creation of the Irish Free State, the Daily Express was associated with Conservative party politics, the Unionist cause in Ireland, and a Protestant readership. No less a subversive than Karl Marx, in an article about Ireland published in the 11 January 1859 New York Daily Tribune, railed against the paper as \"the Government organ\" whipping up hysteria about anti-British violence. In 1881 the paper assisted efforts by the Orange Lodges to provide relief supplies to a large landowner threatened by the Irish Land League. An editor, \"Dr. George Valentine Tyrrell (d. 1899), . . . was said never to have forgiven Gladstone for Disestablishment,\" notes Patrick Maume in \"The Dublin Evening Mail and Pro-Landlord Conservatism in the Age of Gladstone and Parnell,\" Irish Historical Studies 37 (2011): 550-66. Maume describes the politics of both the Express and the Mail as \"ferocious partisanship,\" as compared to the more moderate unionism of the Irish Times (552). \n § This unionist ideology explains the accusation that Miss Ivors playfully lodges against Gabriel Conroy in The Dead: \"Who is G. C.? . . . I have found out that you write for the Daily Express. Now, aren't you ashamed of yourself? . . . To say you'd write for a rag like that. I didn't think you were a West Briton.\" Gabriel does not know how to respond: \"It was true that he wrote a literary column every Wednesday in The Daily Express, for which he was paid fifteen shillings. But that did not make him a West Briton surely. The books he received for review were almost more welcome than the paltry checque. . . . He did not know how to meet her charge. . . . He continued blinking his eyes and trying to smile and murmured lamely that he saw nothing political in writing reviews of books.\" Miss Ivors lets him off the hook by saying that she was only teasing, and that she liked his review of Browning's poems. But once more she leans into his ear and whispers, \"West Briton!\" \n Joyce drew this part of Gabriel's character from his own experience. Over the course of about one year at the age of 20-21, while trying to make a living as a recent graduate of University College, Dublin, he published nearly two dozen book reviews in the Express. In James Joyce A-Z, Nicholas Fargnoli and Michael Gillespie note that the paper normally kept its book reviews completely anonymous, but that the editor Ernest V. Longworth was so upset by Joyce's harsh review of Lady Gregory's Poets and Dreamers in the 26 March 1903 issue that he had the essay printed over Joyce's initials so as to dodge responsibility. If this is so, it hardens the link between Joyce and Gabriel Conroy, whose initials \"G. C.\" have betrayed his identity to Molly Ivors. Joyce's editor outed him for a social outrage; Gabriel feels outed for a political one. \n Joyce was a nationalist, but he vehemently refused to allow political correctness to tyrannize over literary representation or his own personal freedom. It seems certain that he projected some of himself into the hapless Gabriel, tormented by a political partisan when he wants to be left alone to conduct his literary labors in peace. But Molly Ivors, who is no mere ideologue, reflects his awareness that publishing enters one in a world of political actors and political choices.\n The Critical Writings of James Joyce (Viking, 1959) reproduces the 21 short review essays that Joyce published in the Daily Express from December 1902 to November 1903: \n \"An Irish Poet\" (December 11)\n \"George Meredith\" (December 11)\n \"Today and Tomorrow in Ireland\" (January 29)\n \"A Suave Philosophy\" (February 6)\n \"An Effort at Precision in Thinking\" (February 6)\n \"Colonial Verses\" (February 6)\n \"The Soul of Ireland\" (March 26), \n \"Aristotle on Education\" (September 3)\n [A Ne'er-Do-Well], untitled (September 3)\n \"New Fiction\" (September 17)\n \"The Mettle of the Pasture\" (September 17)\n \"A Peep into History\" (September 17)\n \"A French Religious Novel\" (October 1)\n \"Unequal Verse\" (October 1)\n \"Mr. Arnold Graves' New Work\" (October 1)\n \"A Neglected Poet\" (October 15)\n \"Mr. Mason's Novels\" (October 15)\n \"The Bruno Philosophy\" (October 30)\n \"Humanism\" (November 12)\n \"Shakespeare Explained\" (November 12)\n [Borlase and Son], untitled (November 19)"

  "030086dalcassians": {
    "note": " Kevin Egan speaks to Stephen \"Of Ireland, the Dalcassians, of hopes, conspiracies, of Arthur Griffith now.\" His theme is Irish self-rule. The Dalcassians (Dál Cais) were a Gaelic tribe in Munster, with holdings along the River Shannon. They became powerful in the 10th century and produced many kings, including the famous \"Brian Boru\" (Brian Bóruma in Old Irish, Brian Bóroimhe in modern Irish) of whom Bloom thinks in Ithaca. Until the Free State in 1922 and the Republic that followed, Brian was the closest that Ireland got to unified native rule.",
    "expandedNote": " Brian's older brother Mahon (Mathgamain) became the first King of Munster from the Dalcassian line. Brian himself, after waging war brilliantly in Munster, Leinster, and Connacht, and being acknowledged as the ruler of Ireland's Southern Half (Munster and Leinster), challenged the High King Máel Sechnaill in his home province of Meath. Máel Sechnaill surrendered the title of High King to Brian in 1002.\n But the title had seldom if ever been matched by actual control of the entire island, which had hundreds of kings. Brian spent the next decade fighting against the powerful Uí Néill kings in Ulster to make his claim meaningful. By 1011, all the regional powers in Ireland recognized his supremacy, but the fabric began unraveling almost as soon as it was woven. Máel Mórda mac Murchada of Leinster defied the High King in 1012 and fought him for the next two years. Having failed to obtain support from any of the rulers that Brian had dominated in Ulster and Connaught, Máel Mórda turned to Vikings in the Orkney Islands and the Isle of Man, and Hiberno-Norse fighters from the Kingdom of Dublin, to bolster his forces. In April 1014 the two armies met in a furious day-long battle at Clontarf, just north of Dublin on the coast. Brian's forces prevailed, but he was killed in the fighting. \n At some point in the 12th century, a work called Cogadh Gaedhil re Gallaibh (The War of the Irish with the Foreigners), possibly commissioned by Brian's great-grandson, cast Brian's victory at Clontarf as a decisive national victory over Norse occupiers. This work succeeded in making Brian a mythic national hero for later ages. But Brian had Norse fighters in his army just as Máel Mórda did, and the Vikings were not really an occupying force. Like many other invaders of Ireland, they had intermarried with natives and adopted local customs (including Christianity) over the course of several generations and hardly consituted an independent population, much less a ruling class. \n After Brian, the Dalcassians shrank back to their traditional holdings along the banks of the River Shannon in north Munster, in the Kingdom of Thomond. The descendants of Strongbow attempted to take Thomond in the 13th century, but the Dalcassians fought them off. In the 16th century they submitted to the English King Henry VIII, and their territory north of the Shannon was renamed County Clare. \n Cyclops twice makes mention of Thomond, once geographically (\"from the streamy vales of Thomond, from the M'Gillicuddy's reeks the inaccessible and lordly Shannon the unfathomable\") and once politically (\"none of your Henry Tudor's harps, no, the oldest flag afloat, the flag of the province of Desmond and Thomond, three crowns on a blue field, the three sons of Milesius\"). From 1177 onward the English had adopted the three crowns on a blue field as the standard of the Lord of Ireland (the title of the English king in Ireland). But in 1541 Henry VIII proclaimed himself King of Ireland and adopted the Leinster symbol of the harp."

    "note": " One of the three formal orations read or recited in Aeolus is said to be \"the speech last night\" of a actual Dublin merchant and politician, \"Dan Dawson.\" Although no evidence has surfaced of his having composed the sentences and they certainly did not appear in the 16 June 1904 issue of the Freeman's Journal, they appear to be characteristic of other Dawson speeches published in the newspaper. The men in the newspaper office have a grand time mocking the overblown prose. In Hades some discomfort attends Bloom's offer to open up the day's Freeman and read the speech to the men in his carriage.",
    "expandedNote": " As the carriage rolls along Martin Cunningham asks Simon Dedalus if he has read \"Dan Dawson's speech\" and tells him that it was printed \"In the paper this morning.\" Bloom takes this as his cue to pull a copy of the Freeman from his coat pocket, evidently intending to share its contents, but he is rebuffed: \"No, no, Mr Dedalus said quickly. Later on please.\" This exchange registers not only as another snub of the carriage's sole Jewish member, but also as a bit of physical comedy. In his notes to Hades (1992, trans. Hans Wollschlager), Fritz Senn observes that \"Bloom's obsequious contribution to the conversation is once again disregarded. One reason for the disrespect, apart from Bloom's place in society, is simply the size of his newspaper, the Freeman's Journal. Fully-unfolded (a good 60 x 130 cm) [over 4 feet long and nearly 2 feet wide], it would certainly make the already uncomfortable size of the coach even tighter.\" \n In Aeolus Bloom hears raucous laughter coming from the Evening Telegraph office, next door to the Freeman office where he stands, and decides to \"Pop in a minute.\" He finds Ned Lambert occupied in the role that he was earlier barred from performing—reading Dawson's words from the morning paper. The speech praises the natural wonders of \"Our lovely land,\" Ireland, and the color of the prose is decidedly purple. Professor MacHugh calls Dawson an \"inflated windbag,\" Simon Dedalus says the speech would \"give you a heartburn on your arse,\" and Bloom thinks, \"High falutin stuff. Bladderbags.\" Shortly afterward, however, in one of his many acts of parallactic adjustment, Bloom thinks, \"All very fine to jeer at it now in cold print but it goes down like hot cake that stuff.\"\n The words in Aeolus are probably Joyce's over-the-top spoof, but there is good reason to think that he was parodying Dawson's rhetorical practice. In a page on James Joyce Online Notes, Harald Beck identifies several texts in which Mr. Dawson's contemporaries referred to his speechifying. In his memoir Under the Receding Wave (1970), Constantine Curran wrote, \"Alert and spruce, impeccably dressed, flower in button-hole, the elder Dawson delighted in old-fashioned eloquence and in his own\" (136). Dawson's obituary in the 19 March 1917 Freeman's Journal noted his \"wonderful gift of eloquence.\" And a column in the 23 March 1889 issue of The Jarvey, a satirical magazine modeled on London's Punch, remarked on how frequently Dawson's effusions, rich in verbiage and deficient in intellectual content, appeared in the Freeman's Journal.\n The column was addressed to \"Charles Dawson, Esq., Lecturer on Talking about Everything in General and Doing Nothing in Particular.\" It read, in part, \"The Freeman's Journal in particular seems utterly unable to make up its columns without Mr. Dawson on this or Mr. Dawson on that. One day it is Mr. Dawson lecturing in a Club, the next Mr. Dawson holds forth from a public platform. One day it's politics, and the next day industry, and not the least surprising part of the business is that you seem to be quite at home on every subject, from the depth of our mines to the height of our aims. Whether it is a Loaf or a Sunburst, the darning of stockings or the freedom of a nation, Mr. Dawson is semper paratus. . . . notwithstanding your very eloquent exordiums and your coruscating perorations, I sometimes fail to follow your reasoning.\" \n Most helpfully of all, Beck reproduces part of a speech about Ireland, delivered early in April 1904 and printed entire in the The Freeman's Journal on April 7, in which Dawson rhapsodized on \"the boundless resources which a beneficent Providence has spread around on every side—resources which lie buried in the fertile womb of the earth, in the fields and mountains[,] in the rapid rivers, in the fathomless seas which wash our coasts, in the forces of Nature, lately replenished by the discovery of that unchained giant of electricity, the motor of many industries already, and the destined source of countless industries which will ere long awake the silent streets of town and village, and fill the air with the hum of industry all over the land.\" Beck notes the \"Traces of hackneyed metaphors\" in this sentence, which Joyce carved into gaping ruts in Aeolus. \n Charles (Dan) Dawson (1842-1917), the son of a Limerick baker, owned several bakeshops in Dublin. He was elected to the Dublin Corporation in the 1870s and later served as Lord Mayor (1882-83), MP for County Carlow (1880-85), and Collector of Rates (taxes) for the Corporation. When Professor MacHugh exclaims, \"Doughy Daw!,\" Bloom thinks, \"He was in the bakery line too, wasn't he? Why they call him Doughy Daw.\""

  "040016danceofthehours": {
    "note": " Bloom recalls another time when he and Molly stood around at home making their toilette (she was \"Washing her teeth\"), on the \"Morning after the bazaar dance when May's band played Ponchielli's dance of the hours.\" The work is a 10-minute ballet for orchestra, excerpted from Amilcare Ponchielli's opera La Gioconda (1876). It proved hugely popular as a stand-alone work, eventually inspiring parodies as diverse as the dance of the animals in Walt Disney's Fantasia and the popular song \"Hello Muddah, Hello Faddah\" (the latter of which, ironically, contains a reference to Ulysses). Its inclusion in Bloom's thoughts seems significant chiefly as a comment on the narrative structure of Ulysses.",
    "expandedNote": " The ballet is performed at the climactic end of the third act of the opera, as part of a series of entertainments at the palace of Alvise, a nobleman married to one of the two female leads, Laura. He has forced Laura to marry him but she remains in contact with her lover Enzo and plans to escape with him. When Alvise discovers the betrayal he insists that his wife poison herself. The palace celebration ends abruptly as a passing bell sounds and the body of Laura is revealed. The contrast between light and darkness in the ballet thus manages to suggest the struggle between forces of good and evil in the opera. It is possible that Joyce expects his reader to do something with this, since Boylan too was present at the dance and Molly has been asking interested questions about him. (\"Is that Boylan well off? . . . I noticed he had a good rich smell off his breath dancing.\") By this logic the well-off Boylan might stand in for Alvise somehow.\n § But the text gives no indication that Bloom (or Joyce, for that matter) knows anything about the operatic context surrounding the ballet. He thinks only about the dance itself and how it represents the passing of hours throughout the course of one day. Molly may have asked him about the significance of this work played the night before, because he thinks, \"Explain that: morning hours, noon, then evening coming on, then night hours.\" Several sentences later he is still thinking about the work's significance: \"Evening hours, girls in grey gauze. Night hours then: black with daggers and eyemasks. Poetical idea: pink, then golden, then grey, then black. Still, true to life also. Day: then the night.\"\n The more promising hermeneutical application of the allusion, then, is to the writing of a fiction such as Ulysses, which begins with dawn and follows the course of one day. Bloom has been reading Philip Beaufoy's story in the newspaper and has \"envied kindly Mr Beaufoy who had written it and received payment of three pounds, thirteen and six.\" He thinks that he himself (aided by Molly's felicitous expressions) \"Might manage a sketch. By Mr and Mrs L. M. Bloom. Invent a story for some proverb. Which?\"\n Bloom has no further thoughts about which proverb to illustrate, but much later in the novel, in Eumaeus, he realizes that the events of June 16 have given him material that he could turn into a story. Meeting Stephen and descending with him into Dublin's nighttime underbelly inspires him to wonder whether he could write \"a miniature cameo of the world we live in,\" and by thus imitating the writer who has created him earn some extra cash: \"he wondered whether he might meet with anything approaching the same luck as Mr Philip Beaufoy if taken down in writing suppose he were to pen something out of the common groove (as he fully intended doing) at the rate of one guinea per column. My Experiences, let us say, in a Cabman's Shelter.\"\n The dancers in Ponchielli's ballet represent first the hours of dawn, then daylight, then evening, then night, and finally morning again, by means of variously colored costumes and lights. It thus resembles the shape of Ulysses, which begins with the sun starting to warm Dublin in Telemachus and Calypso, moves through the hours of the day, shows evening coming on in Nausicaa, devotes several chapters to the night, and anticipates the reappearance of the sun late in Ithaca. The novel's allusion to the dance of the hours thus self-referentially reflects on its way of structuring action, which is designed to be \"true to life.\""

  "020038oconnell": {
    "note": " Deasy tells Stephen, \"I saw three generations since O'Connell's time,\" implying some claim to historical authority and also perhaps wrapping himself in a bit of the cloak of the great Irish leader. But Deasy believes in very different things than Daniel O'Connell stood for, among them Union and anti-Semitism.",
    "expandedNote": " Daniel O'Connell (1775-1847), a pioneer of nonviolent resistance to British rule known as The Liberator or The Emancipator, campaigned in the 1810s and 20s for the right of Irish Catholics to become Members of the British Parliament in Westminster (achieved in 1829), and in the 1840s for repeal of the Act of Union, replacing the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland with two nations under one British monarch (never achieved). \n In his campaign to restore the Irish Parliament in Dublin, O'Connell staged a series of immense outdoor \"monster meetings\" in historic Irish locations. Stephen thinks in Aeolus of the two biggest ones: \"Hosts at Mullaghmast and Tara of the kings. Miles of ears of porches. The tribune's words, howled and scattered to the four winds. A people sheltered within his voice.\" Gifford notes that even by the conservative estimate of the British authorities, the August 1843 rally held at the Hill of Tara (northwest of Dublin, the purported seat of Ireland's ancient High Kings) drew 250,000 people. \n After the October 1843 rally at Mullaghmast (SW of Dublin, site of a perfidious English massacre in 1577), the British Prime Minister banned another one planned for Clontarf (just north of Dublin, site of High King Brian Boru's decisive defeat of the Vikings in 1014). O'Connell complied with the order to avoid bloodshed, and for his pains was subsequently arrested and sentenced to a year's imprisonment. No more monster meetings were held, and although O'Connell's sentence was shortened, his poor health after his release from prison ended his political campaigns. \n In 1847, after making a pilgrimage to Rome, O'Connell died in Genoa. His heart was removed from the body and interred in Sant'Agata dei Goti, the chapel of the Irish College in Rome, a fact noted by Mr. Power in Hades: \"He's at rest, he said, in the middle of his people, old Dan O'. But his heart is buried in Rome.\" \n Leopold Bloom thinks in Hades about the \"generations\" since O'Connell in a vividly personal sense. Standing in the cemetery with the caretaker, John O'Connell, he thinks that \"Daniel O'Connell must be a descendant I suppose who is this used to say he was a queer breedy man great catholic all the same.\" Gifford observes that this thought alludes to \"the rumors still persistent in Dublin that Daniel O'Connell had a number of illegitimate children and was thus literally as well as figuratively 'the father of his country.'\"\n It is not certain that Joyce knew that O'Connell worked to secure the civil rights of Jews as well as Catholics, but O'Connell said to the Jews of Ireland (like Mr. Deasy at the end of Nestor, but sympathetically) that \"Ireland has claims on your ancient race, it is the only country that I know of unsullied by any one act of persecution of the Jews.\" (See http://www.jewishireland.org/irish-jewish-history/history.) O'Connell worked successfully to repeal the ancient English law that prescribed distinctive dress for Jews. His efforts to repeal the Oath of Supremacy that made it impossible for Catholics to become MPs (since it required officeholders to swear allegiance to the King as head of the Church of England) resulted, in 1858, in Parliament creating an exception to the Oath of Allegiance that barred the door to Jews (since it contained the clause, \"I make this declaration upon the true Faith of a Christian\").\n It is tempting to hear an oblique allusion to O'Connell's common cause with Jews in Mr. Deasy's statement that Ireland \"has the honour of being the only country which never persecuted the Jews,\" particularly since Leopold Bloom so strongly shares O'Connell's faith in nonviolent resistance and social reform through legal means. If Joyce intended an allusion to O'Connell in Deasy's bigoted statement, it would highlight Deasy's role as a false father figure to Stephen, connected very indirectly to Bloom by their differing reflections of the great Irish Liberator."

  "030114darenotspeak": {
    "note": " The \"love that dare not speak its name\" is not a line of \"Wilde's,\" though it certainly applies to him. It was written by his lover Lord Alfred Douglas (\"Bosie\"), a poet of some accomplishment. Stephen's recollection of the phrase in Proteus solidifies some of the homoerotic suggestions conveyed by his thoughts about Mulligan in Telemachus. In Scylla and Charybdis he applies it to Shakespeare, who wrote most of his sonnets to the younger man with whom he was in love.",
    "expandedNote": " The speaker of Two Loves envisions two young men \"walking on a shining plain / Of Golden light,\" one of them happily singing of the loves of girls and boys, the other sighing. He asks the sad one for his name and is told, \"I am Love.\" The happy one angrily cries, \"'He lieth, for his name is Shame, / But I am Love, and I was wont to be / Alone in this fair garden, till he came / Unasked by night; I am true Love, I fill / The hearts of boy and girl with mutual flame.'\" The sad lover acquiesces: \"'Have thy will, / I am the love that dare not speak its name.'\" \n That acquiescence was confirmed by the sad outcome of the struggle with Douglas' father, the Marquess of Queensberry. Both sides referred to the poem during the trial for libel that Wilde initiated, the Marquess' lawyer as evidence of criminal homosexual activity and Wilde as the expression of a Platonic devotion. Thornton quotes what Wilde said about it: \"The 'Love that dare not speak its name' in this century is such a great affection of an elder for a younger man as there was between David and Jonathan. . . . It is that deep, spiritual affection that is as pure as it is perfect. . . . There is nothing unnatural about it. It is intellectual, and it repeatedly exists between an elder and a younger man, when the elder man has intellect, and the younger man has all the joy, hope, and glamour of life before him.\" Wilde lost the libel suit, and then was himself tried for \"gross indecency.\" He served two years in prison doing hard labor.\n In Proteus Stephen thinks of the words as he characterizes Mulligan more approvingly than he ever did in Telemachus: \"Staunch friend, a brother soul: Wilde's love that dare not speak its name. He now will leave me. And the blame? As I am. As I am. All or not at all.\" Like the friendship with Cranly in A Portrait of the Artist, Mulligan represents the possibility of an intense same-sex involvement with a slightly older man—a possibility that is in the process of dissolving. The same features characterize Shakespeare's devotion to the young man of the sonnets. In Scylla and Charybdis Stephen talks about how the poet's female lover \"spurned him for a lord, his dearmylove.\" In interior monologue he thinks, \"Love that dare not speak its name.\"\n Given the perils of same-sex love speaking its name it is perhaps not surprising that A Portrait, Telemachus, and Proteus, like Shakespeare's sonnets to the young man, should avoid raising the question of sexual desire. But Stephen does address this issue at least glancingly in Scylla and Charybdis, and there he seems clearly uninterested in a sexual relationship with Mulligan. Homosexual love is one in a long line of non-standard sexual practices that he cites as being less censured by taboo than father-son incest: \"Sons with mothers, sires with daughters, lesbic sisters, loves that dare not speak their name, nephews with grandmothers, jailbirds with keyholes, queens with prize bulls.\" When Mulligan \"amorously\" recounts the answer that Ernest Dowden made to \"the charge of pederasty brought against the bard\" (\"All we can say is that life ran very high in those days\"), Stephen thinks, \"Catamite.\""

They were gentlemen.\" The phrase \"dark and evil days\" appears in a poem from the 1840s by the Irish mathematician, economist, and poet John Kells Ingram, whose Protestant background, shared with many of the United Irishmen, appeals to Kernan.",
    "expandedNote": " Gifford notes that Kernan's \"They were gentlemen\" (following his image of Fitzgerald as a \"Fine dashing young nobleman. Good stock, of course\") is \"A typical 'west Briton' phrase used to exonerate Anglo-Irish Protestant revolutionaries (such as Fitzgerald, Wolfe Tone, Emmet—and even Parnell) from the sort of blame due the croppies.\" The United Irishmen movement of the late 18th century was truly ecumenical, supported by patriots both Catholic and Protestant, though the latter were mostly Presbyterians and Methodists, not members of the Ascendancy class's official Church of Ireland. \n Ingram was born in 1823 to an Ulster Scots (hence Protestant) family living in the southeastern corner of County Donegal, near Lower Lough Erne. Although he considered Ireland unready for independence he abhorred tyranny and his poem, The Memory of the Dead, celebrates the sacrifices of the men killed in '98:\n Who fears to speak of Ninety-Eight?\n Who blushes at the name?\n When cowards mock the patriots' fate,\n Who hangs his head for shame?\n He’s all a knave or half a slave\n Who slights his country thus;\n But a true man, like you, man,\n Will fill your glass with us.\n We drink the memory of the brave,\n The faithful and the few:\n Some lie far off beyond the wave\n Some sleep in Ireland, too;\n All, all are gone—but still lives on\n The fame of those who died:\n All true men, like you, men,\n Remember them with pride.\n Some on the shores of distant lands\n Their weary hearts have laid,\n And by the stranger's heedless hands\n Their lonely graves were made;\n But, though their clay be far away\n Beyond the Atlantic foam,\n In true men, like you, men,\n Their spirit's still at home.\n The dust of some is Irish earth;\n Among their own they rest;\n And the same land that gave them birth\n Has caught them to her breast;\n And we will pray that from their clay\n Full many a race may start\n Of true men, like you, men,\n To act as brave a part.\n They rose in dark and evil days\n To right their native land:\n They kindled here a living blaze\n That nothing shall withstand.\n Alas, that Might can vanquish Right!\n They fell, and pass'd away;\n But true men, like you, men,\n Are plenty here today.\n Then here's their memory—may it be\n For us a guiding light,\n To cheer our strife for liberty\n And teach us to unite!\n Through good and ill, be Ireland's still,\n Though sad as theirs your fate;\n And true men be you, men,\n Like those of Ninety-Eight.\n Ingram wrote this, his most famous poem, in March 1843 while a student at Trinity College, Dublin. It was published anonymously on 1 April 1843 in The Nation, a newspaper dedicated to repealing the Act of Union, and in 1845 John Edward Pigot set it to music for voice and piano. Despite Ingram's distrust of republican nationalism the ballad entered the pantheon of republican songs, and its tune has often been piped at the funerals of fighters. Douglas Hyde translated the text into Irish.\n Tom Kernan confuses the musical version of Ingram's poem with The Croppy Boy: \"Ben Dollard does sing that ballad touchingly. Masterly rendition. / At the siege of Ross did my father fall.\" Although the croppy boy is Catholic and the rebels of Ingram'sMemory were Protestant, Kernan's slip is understandable because both ballads tell stories of patriots who lost their lives in the Rebellion of '98. And, as Ruth Wüst points out in a personal communication, both were published in the same paper. The Croppy Boy appeared in The Nation in 1845, two years after the publication of Ingram's poem and the same year in which the poem was set to music. The two compositions remain linked in Sirens: as Bloom projects his own feeling of being the \"Last of my race\" onto the croppy boy, he thinks, \"Who fears to speak of nineteen four?\""

  "020023darkness": {
    "note": " In Nestor Stephen associates darkness with mysterious metaphysical truth. His symbolism inverts a standard biblical identification of truth with divine light. The purpose seems to be something like the \"transvaluation of values\" envisioned by the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche: transforming a Christian trope that denies the fullness of human life into one that affirms it. Stephen's embrace of \"darkness\" anticipates his encounter with a freethinking Jew, his exploration of non-Christian cosmologies, and his production of creative works that affirm forces like sexual passion.",
    "expandedNote": " The opening verses of John's gospel proclaim: \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.... All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.... And the light shineth in darkess; and the darkness comprehended it not\" (1:1-5). Light and darkness are symbolic in this formulation, and some later Christian thinkers would reverse the arbitrary opposites in order to articulate religious values different from the Greek Logos. Thornton cites some critical efforts to connect Stephen's language with Neoplatonic Christian writers like the pseudo-Dionysius (a late 5th and early 6th century Syrian theologian writing in Greek) and Henry Vaughan (a 17th century Welsh poet writing in English), both of whom propounded a mystical spirituality of transcending sense perception and reasoning to enter \"the darkness of unknowing.\" \n Stephen clearly echoes the beginning of John's gospel and reimagines its message of a cosmic creative principle beaming light down into the world. Instead of the Logos he imagines an \"obscure soul of the world,\" a \"darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not comprehend.\" The Platonic idea of a world soul was famously revived in the 16th century by Giordano Bruno, a daring proto-modern philosopher whom the Catholic church condemned as a heretic. Bruno was important to Joyce from Stephen Hero to Finnegans Wake, and Stephen has already defended him in A Portrait of the Artist. In his concluding diary he recalls a conversation with one of his Jesuit priests: \"He said Bruno was a terrible heretic. I said he was terribly burned. He agreed to this with some sorrow.\" The Brunonian idea that most enraged Catholics, his belief in multiple worlds beyond the earth, shows up in Proteus, again linked with darkness: \"Darkly they are there behind this light, darkness shining in the brightness, delta of Cassiopeia, worlds.\"\n Stephen also associates darkness with the human form that theLogos assumed in this world—i.e., Jesus. He thinks of the Pharisees not comprehending the \"long look from dark eyes\" that Jesus gave them. And like Bloom, who tells the Citizen in Cyclops that \"Your God was a jew. Christ was a jew like me,\" he tries to imagine these dark eyes in a face different from those limned by light-skinned Christians. Mr. Deasy uses John's language to reinforce anti-Semitic stereotypes: \"— They sinned against the light, Mr Deasy said gravely. And you can see the darkness in their eyes.\" Stephen not only opposes such bigotry, he thinks of Averroes and Moses Maimonides (one of them Muslim, one Jewish) as \"dark men in mien and movement.\" This racial disagreement in Nestor anticipates Stephen's encounters with Bloom later in the book. Bloom's dark clothes ally him symbolically with Stephen, and the dark Jewish eyes that Mr. Deasy finds so suspicious becomes one source of his mysterious attraction. InIthaca, Stephen also considers Bloom's \"winedark hair,\" making him Odysseus as well as Jesus.\n The symbolism of darkness pops up too in Stephen's contemplation of his own psychology and his creative processes. Bending over Sargent at his sums, he thinks of the secrets that lurk \"in the dark palaces of both our hearts.\" Recalling his time at the Sainte Geneviève library in Paris, he imagines these dark presences as dragonlike: \"and in my mind's darkness a sloth of the underworld, reluctant, shy of brightness, shifting her dragon scaly folds.\" This meditation, prompted by the cavern-like darkness of the library, strongly evokes the underground caves in William Blake's The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, where dragons inhabit \"a Printing house in Hell\" in which \"knowledge is transmitted from generation to generation.\" Blake's poem explicitly seeks a transvaluation of values: Hell, symbolic of dark forces in the human psyche that Christianity has traditionally defined as evil (passion, energy, hatred), will be married to the things defined as good (reason, self-control, love) to produce a complete picture of humanity. \n Having rejected Christianity more completely than Blake did, Stephen nevertheless maintains a strong attachment to its symbols, rituals, and creeds. His own idiosyncratic poetic vision, when he produces it, will not utterly abandon the structures of thought erected over two millennia by the church. In some instances it will invert and reinterpret them."

  "020003daughtersofmemory": {
    "note": " Discouraged by the story of Pyrrhus and by history in general, Stephen thinks of the apocalyptic alternatives to empirical knowledge proposed by the visionary English poet William Blake (1757-1827). Phrases throughout the seventh paragraph of Nestor come from particular passages in Blake's writings. While skeptical of their \"excess,\" Stephen feels his imagination stirred by their vision of an absolute reality transcending earthly injustice.",
    "expandedNote": " \"Fabled by the daughters of memory\" recalls the second plate of A Vision of the Last Judgment. There Blake distinguishes \"Fable or Allegory,\" produced by the daughters of Memory (i.e. the nine Muses descended from Mnemosyne), from \"Imagination,\" produced by the daughters of Inspiration. Empirical understanding—knowledge based on memory—is a mere \"Fable\" in Blake's estimation, while imagination yields what he calls \"Vision.\" The vision at issue is \"The Last Judgment\"; for Blake, this Christian myth is not a mere fable or allegory, but rather something that \"Eternally Exists, Really & Unchangeably.\"\n Stephen is attracted to Blake's conception of visionary truth because it would define all history as essentially false, but the Aristotelian empiricist in him immediately counters, \"And yet it was in some way if not as memory fabled it.\" The world is more than the mind's conception of it; actual things happened to produce the reality that now enslaves us. As Stephen thinks a few paragraphs later, \"They are not to be thought away. Time has branded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite possibilities they have ousted.\"\n \"A phrase, then, of impatience, thud of Blake's wings of excess\": one of the devils' Proverbs in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell holds that \"The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom,\" and another one that \"No bird soars too high, if he soars with his own wings.\" Blake has characteristically overshot the mark, Stephen thinks, and his wings of excess strike the ear with (or fall to earth with?) a thud.\n But Stephen is enchanted by the language of apocalyptic transcendence, and will remain so throughout the novel. Blake also writes in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell that \"The ancient tradition that the world will be consumed in fire at the end of six thousand years is true, as I have heard from Hell.\" And when that fiery consummation occurs, \"the whole creation will be consumed and appear infinite and holy, whereas it now appears finite & corrupt.\" Thornton cites other passages about the fiery end of the world from A Vision of the Last Judgment. Stirred by this vision, Stephen thinks of \"the ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry, and time one livid final flame.\" The shattered glass and toppling masonry do not come from Blake, but are consistent with his apocalyptic vision. Thornton notes that Blake wrote in a letter to William Hayley in 1800 that \"The ruins of Time build mansions in Eternity.\" \n Gifford obscurely connects these words to \"a vision of the fall of Troy, a lost cause not unlike the efforts of the Tarentines under Pyrrhus to resist the domination of Rome.\" The association seems possible but hardly conclusive, and one perhaps need not look so far back in time, given Blake's perennial association of poetic apocalypse with political revolution. In Proteus, Stephen repeats the words ofNestor verbatim when he thinks of Kevin Egan's revolutionary activities: \"he prowled with colonel Richard Burke, tanist of his sept, under the walls of Clerkenwell and, crouching, saw a flame of vengeance hurl them upward in the fog. Shattered glass and toppling masonry.\" Stephen certainly does associate Blake's apocalyptic vision with \"lost causes,\" but all such causes converge in his mind on the question of Irish independence."

  "080024davybyrnes": {
    "note": " A Dublin institution to this day, in part because the fictional Leopold Bloom eats lunch there in Lestrygonians, \"Davy Byrne's\" is a public house on Duke Street in the prosperous southeastern part of the central city. Bloom thinks of it as a \"Moral pub,\" because of the character of the eponymous proprietor and the benign environment he has created. Joyce may possibly have intended a polemical edge to this phrase, since there is evidence that Byrne was gay and that his pub may have served as a hangout for gay men during his lifetime.",
    "expandedNote": " Coming to Dublin in 1873 as a 12-year-old boy from County Wicklow, Byrne served as an apprentice in one pub before working his way up to part-ownership in another and then, in 1889, purchasing a run-down tavern at 21 Duke Street which he reopened under his own name. His life-story thus confirms what Bloom thinks in Calypso about publicans: \"Coming up redheaded curates from the county Leitrim, rinsing empties and old man in the cellar. Then, lo and behold, they blossom out as Adam Findlaters or Dan Tallons.\"\n Vivien Igoe observes that Byrne \"was a good listener and had a way of winning friendships and retaining them. His pub became the haunt of poets, artists, writers, scholars and politicians. These included James Joyce, Michael Collins, Arthur Griffith, F. R. Higgins, Pádraic Ó Conaire, Tom Kettle, Liam O'Flaherty and William Orpen, who was one of Byrne's greatest friends.\" A longer list would include Oliver St. John Gogarty and James Stephens, and later writers like Patrick Kavanagh, Brian O'Nolan (Myles na gCopaleen, Flann O'Brien), Brendan Behan, and Anthony Cronin. Actors (including the famous gay couple Hilton Edwards and Michael MacLiammoir), actresses, and dancers also frequented the pub, attracted by the artistic flair of its interior. Byrne died in 1938. \n When Bloom reflects that Byrne's is a \"moral\" place, several things jump to his mind: \"He doesn't chat. Stands a drink now and then. But in leapyear once in four. Cashed a cheque for me once.\" As the narrative of Lestrygonians continues, other indications of sound character appear. Byrne doesn't bet on the horses: \"— I wouldn't do anything at all in that line, Davy Byrne said. It ruined many a man the same horses.\" He notices when people are in mourning and tactfully respects their privacy: \"— I never broach the subject, Davy Byrne said humanely, if I see a gentleman is in trouble that way. It only brings it up fresh in their minds.\" And he recognizes Bloom's uncommon qualities: \"Decent quiet man he is. I often saw him in here and I never once saw him, you know, over the line. . . . He's a safe man, I'd say.\" Like his silent assessment of the butcher's Jewishness in Calypso, then, Bloom's quiet appreciation of Byrne's moral qualities seems to reflect an awareness of shared values. They are birds of a feather.\n In a personal communication from Dublin, Senan Molony adds another sympathetic detail to Byrne's biography: in an intolerant time and place he seems to have been monogamously devoted to a male partner. Census records of 1901 and 1911 retrieved by Molony show that Byrne was (respectively) \"not married\" and \"single.\" Far more remarkably, a tombstone in the Glasnevin cemetery stands atop two graves and preserves the memory of two men: \"of David Byrne, who died on the 10th September 1938, and of his friend Thomas Campbell, who died on the 10th March 1927.\" Such an inscription, in the repressively moralistic atmosphere of Ireland in the 1930s, should probably be seen as a bold defiance of conventional sexual mores. \n (Another Thomas Campbell, a Romantic-era Scottish poet, surfaces twice in Hades—once anonymously when Bloom recalls a line from one of his poems, and again by name when he wonders about the authorship of a different poem. These references are quite definitive, and since the Dublin Campbell died in 1927 there would be no particular reason to allude to him in the cemetery chapter. Still, given Joyce's fondness for name coincidences, it is not inconceivable that he knew of Byrne's friend and obliquely acknowledged him by bringing in the poet.)\n If indeed Joyce had reason to think that Byrne was homosexual, that purely natural inclination would not by itself justify calling the man and his establishment \"moral.\" But in a time when morality was widely invoked to demean non-standard sexual orientations, not to mention unacceptably frank works of literature (Ulysses shows heteronormative desire to be riven with channels like voyeurism, adultery, masochism, and anal eroticism that render it very non-normative), Joyce's use of the word to characterize an all-but-out gay man may mask a cutting edge. What would seem an \"immoral\" pub to many people becomes a moral one with the stroke of a pen, suggesting that Joyce's celebration of human happiness over social conformity extended into his assessment of same-sex love. \n Evidence that Davy Byrne's pub was \"moral\" in the sense of tolerating queerness can be found later in the 20th century. For most of that century Dublin was a very lonely place for gay men. A 2013 blog by Sam McGrath on the Come Here to Me! website cites one man's recollections from the 1970s, recorded in Coming Out: Irish Gay Experiences (2003): \"There weren’t many opportunities to meet gay people, unless you knew of the one bar—two bars, actually, in Dublin at that time, Bartley Dunne’s and Rice’s … They were the two pubs and if you hadn’t met gay people, you wouldn’t have known about these pubs; there was no advertising in those days, and it was all through word-of-mouth.\" The same two bars are mentioned by another gay man, George Fullerton, who is quoted from Occasions of Sin: Sex and Society in Modern Ireland (2009) as saying that in the 1960s \"I never experienced discrimination as such, probably because we were largely invisible.\" \n These two bars near the Gaiety Theatre and St. Stephen's Green became known as gay-friendly starting in the late 1950s and early 1960s, along with King's, another pub in the same area that is mentioned less often. But there were two more in Duke Street: The Bailey and Davy Byrne's. The 1971 edition of Fielding's Travel Guide to Europe noted that \"On our latest visit, scads of hippie-types and Gay Boys were in evidence\" in the Bailey, and it suggested that both that bar and Davy Byrne's, across the street, were not \"recommended for the 'straight' traveller\" (779). It seems likely that the welcoming atmosphere in Davy Byrne's may have dated back to its original proprietor. Proof of this is hard to come by, but there are tantalizing bits of evidence that may be featured in a later version of this note.\n Mentally calculating his day's expenses in Sirens, Bloom thinks back on the 7d. he spent on a gorgonzola sandwich and a glass of burgundy in Davy Byrne's. In Circe the publican himself returns, reliving the bored yawn that he gave in reply to Nosey Flynn's ramblings about the Freemasons in Lestrygonians: \"— O, it’s a fine order, Nosey Flynn said. They stick to you when you’re down. I know a fellow was trying to get into it. But they’re as close as damn it. By God they did right to keep the women out of it. / Davy Byrne smiledyawnednodded all in one: / — Iiiiiichaaaaaaach!\"Ithaca mentions the pub yet once more, with a misremembered address: \"David Byrne's licensed premises, 14 Duke Street.\""

    "note": " In Aeolus an office door creaks open and \"Davy Stephens, minute in a large capecoat, a small felt hat crowning his ringlets, passed out with a roll of papers under his cape, a king's courier.\" A hallucinated version of this \"ringletted\" figure reappears inCirce, hawking newspapers and surrounded with \"a bevy of barefoot newsboys\" such as were seen repeatedly running in and out of the news offices in the earlier chapter. Stephens (early 1840s-1925) was a vendor of newspapers and periodicals at Kingstown Harbour, where passenger-carrying mailboats crossed the channel to Britain twice daily. Hailing travelers with witty, uninhibited blather well suited for selling papers, he made himself a well-known fixture of greater Dublin.",
    "expandedNote": " Vivien Igoe, who lists Stephens' birth date definitively as 1845, reports that he \"started work aged six, selling copies of Saunder's Newsletter to support his widowed mother. For 60 years he operated from the steps of the railway station at Kingstown (now Dún Laoghaire).\" This location allowed him quite literally to corner a major news market: nearly everyone who traveled between Dublin and London took the mailboats, connecting by train at either end. Cyril Pearl quotes Stephens' claim to have sold papers to \"monarchs, princes, potentates, viceroys, all grades of the aristocracy, Lord Chancellors, Prime Ministers, Commanders-in-Chief, Cardinals, Archbishops . . . artists, authors, jockeys, prizefighters, aeronauts, tight and slack rope-walkers, and dancers . . . and 'long' and 'short drop' hangmen\" (Dublin in Bloomtime, 49). The Emperor of Brazil, he notes, offered him the position of Court Jester. \n The Amazonian poobah's offer suggests that Stephens' energetic hobnobbing with the high and mighty involved more than a little condescension on their part, but he met them halfway, recouping whatever scraps of personal dignity they surrendered. In the best Dublin tradition of flamboyant self-promotion, Stephens cultivated an image of closeness to power, styling himself the Prince of the News Vendors, or the King of the Newsboys. Many people joined the game by addressing him as Sir Davy. Joyce's phrase \"a king's courier\" alludes to Stephens' amicable interactions withKing Edward VII when he came to Ireland in 1903, reprising earlier conversations when Albert Edward had visited as Prince of Wales. The autobiography that he published in 1903 records that Queen Victoria gave him a sovereign on one of her visits; he \"loyally\" kept it \"mounted in a gold clasp ready for inspection\" and pinned it to his coat \"on special occasions.\"\n Many socially prominent persons besides Their Majesties seem to have embraced Davy Stephens. Pearl observes that Lord Northcliffe, who came to Ireland for the Gordon-Bennett Cup, \"invited Davy to accompany him in his car, and when someone occupied Davy's stand during one of his regular attendances at the English Derby, Michael Davitt raised the matter in the House of Commons\" (49-50). A prominent Irish MP, in other words, intervened in Parliament to protect Stephens' de facto monopoly on news vending in Kingstown. Pearl adds that \"Davy's activities were reported regularly in the Irish Society and Social Review. A paragraph in the issue of 31st October 1903 reads: 'Davy had a great shake hands from Mr John Morley the other day. Davy congratulated him on the life of Gladstone, and presented him with a copy of his own life, just published. Mr Morley said he would read it carefully, and perhaps he might see a review of it in one of the greatest of London's dailies'\" (50). \n This autobiography, The Life and Times of Davy Stephens: The Renowned Kingstown Newsman, took comical self-aggrandizement to an admirably high pitch: \"His exterior is peculiar but prepossessing. Standing a little below the usual height for the proverbial Irishman [Joyce calls him \"minute\"], this point is quickly lost sight of in a deep well of wit, not yet completely sounded, beaming forth in his eyes. No one can say whether it is in the merry glance of his eye or in the quick repartee that issues from his lips, never for a moment sealed, that Davy's fortune lies. The corners of his mouth are turned up in a perpetual smile which his clean shaven chin tends to emphasise.\"\n In a characterization that Joyce may well have appreciated, Stephens noted that \"His hair hangs down over his shoulders in long strings, reminding one of that of Ulysses when tossed by the sea at the feet of the charming Nausicaa, and the fresh breezes of the Channel have reduced his complexion to a compromise between red and brown. In a black frieze overcoat and a soft Trilby hat [\"a large capecoat, a small felt hat\"] he braves the cross-Channel gales in winter as readily as he broils beneath the portico of the railway station when the temperature is only 88 degrees in the shade. Atmospheric variations seemingly exert no influence on the perfect constitution of Davy. The scent of the briny and the glint of the sunshine are alike to him. Add to these particulars a fine rich brogue and the man is complete.\"\n The Thom's records suggest that, near the end of his long life, Stephens forsook the rigors of his outdoor post for a more sedentary life. In 1911, when he would have been nearly 70 years old, he was living at 33 Upper George's Street in Kingstown and running a stationery business."

  "040053deadsea": {
    "note": " The disappearance of the sun in Calypso sends Bloom's reveries into a very dark place. Where the Near East had inspired pleasant thoughts, first of wandering through the streets of an Islamic city, then of owning shares in a Palestinian plantation, and finally of enjoying the fruits of that region with Jewish friends, it now centers on the \"dead sea,\" a \"Vulcanic lake\" that makes him think of the biblical story of the destruction of the \"cities of the plain: Sodom, Gomorrah, Edom.\" The story of Lot's family seems emblematic to Bloom of the fate of the entire Jewish people. Soon it will be clear that he is thinking also of his own life.",
    "expandedNote": " Of \"Vulcanic lake, the dead sea,\" Gifford observes that \"In the mid-nineteenth century, the Dead Sea was assumed to occupy the giant crater of a dead or inactive volcano, but by 1903 the New International Encyclopedia could announce: \"The region is not, as has been supposed, volcanic.\" Bloom's slightly outdated science allows him to connect the Dead Sea to the fire and brimstone that the Bible often associates with divine wrath: \"Brimstone they called it raining down.\" Brimstone is the biblical name for sulphur, whose strongly unpleasant odor often accompanies volcanic eruptions. Elemental sulphur is highly flammable.\n Numerous passages in the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament threaten the wicked with fire and brimstone, e.g. Genesis 19:24, Deuteronomy 29:23, Psalm 11:6, Isaiah 30:33 and 34:9, Ezekiel 38:22, Revelation 19:20, 20:10, and 21:8. Bloom seems to be thinking mainly of the first of these, the chapter of Genesis in which YHWH's angels direct Lot and his family members to leave their city of Sodom: \"Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven; and he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground\" (19:24-25). \n This chapter does not list all the \"cities of the plain\" (29), but in an earlier chapter of Genesis Sodom and Gomorrah are grouped with Admah, Zeboiim, and Zoar as cities that \"were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea\" (14:2-3). The Valley of Siddim is usually understood to be on the southern shores of the Dead Sea, and Zoar was almost certainly located just south of that salt-laden lake. Bloom mistakenly remembers \"Edom,\" a desert region slightly farther south, as having been one of the five cities. \n This \"barren land, bare waste\"—sunk deep in the earth, blasted by volcanic ash, sterilized of life, reeking of sulphur, bordering the \"poisonous foggy waters\" of a weedless, fishless sea—returns in Oxen of the Sun, where the biblical \"waste land\" is now \"a home of screechowls and the sandblind upupa.\" In this passage of Oxen, huge animals \"come trooping to the sunken sea, Lacus Mortis. . . . Onward to the dead sea they tramp to drink, unslaked and with horrible gulpings, the salt somnolent inexhaustible flood.\"\n In Calypso the blasted condition of the land images the fate of the Jewish people. For Bloom they are \"the oldest, the first race,\" \"The oldest people.\" The polar antithesis to Zionist dreams of making the desert bloom, in his imagination, is the thought that Jews have \"Wandered far away over all the earth, captivity to captivity, multiplying, dying, being born everywhere,\" and now have no home to return to. The land that gave their lives meaning has no more life to give: \"It lay there now. Now it could bear no more. Dead: an old woman's: the grey sunken cunt of the world.\" The focus on childbearing in these sentences makes clear that Bloom is thinking not only of the Jewish people, but also of his own life as a husband, a father, a bearer of family lineage."

  "030152delta": {
    "note": " In several chapters of Ulysses, Stephen thinks of a star, \"delta in Cassiopeia,\" near which an intensely bright new star appeared in 1572, soon becoming visible even in daytime. In Proteus this spectacular astronomical development, known today to have been a supernova, sparks his interest in extraterrestrial life. In Scylla and Charybdishe presents it as an occult announcement of the birth of William Shakespeare. In Ithaca, his mention of the nova prompts the more astronomically informed Bloom to recall several other, less bright ones that were spotted in the second half of the 19th century. All three passages play with the idea that the celestial heavens are intimately connected with life on earth.",
    "expandedNote": " The delta star in the familiar W-shaped constellation of Cassiopeia is actually a binary system (two orbitally locked stars, a phenomenon which Ithaca calls \"the interdependent gyrations of double suns\") that lies about 100 light years from Earth in the Milky Way galaxy. In the first few days of November 1572, various observers noticed a new star near this old one. The nova grew steadily brighter until, on November 16, it exceeded the brightness of the planet Venus and could be seen by the naked eye in daytime. About a year and a half later, it faded from view. In 1573 the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe published a book titled De nova et nullius aevi memoria prius visa stella (\"On the new, and never before seen in anyone's life or memory, star\"). His small tome gave rise to the term \"nova,\" and today the exploded star seen near delta Cassiopeia is often called Tycho's Supernova. Its remnants, less than 10,000 light years away (also in the Milky Way), were discovered by radio telescope in the 1950s.\n The nova seized people's imaginations in the 16th century not only because of its brightness but because such things were not supposed to happen. In the regular, clocklike movements of the heavens, novel and unexplained dynamic phenomena like meteors and comets often caused alarm and were interpreted as baleful omens. But such relatively nearby occurrences were encountered relatively often. Farther out from earth, such changes were seldom seen and Scholastic philosophers even asserted that they were impossible. Aristotle had written that beyond the sphere of the moon the heavens appeared to be changeless, and his speculation had hardened into an inflexible doctrine that planets and stars are made of different stuff than our perishable phenomena. Stars simply could not come into or pass out of being. Now one had done so, and Tycho, observing that its position did not change parallactically, argued that it must lie far beyond the orbit of our moon. \n In Proteus Stephen seems to associate this evidence that the heavens are as mutable as the earth with a comparable idea advanced in the late 16th century: Giordano Bruno's argument that the universe is full of worlds like our own. Bruno (1548-1600), who was almost exactly contemporary with Tycho (1546-1601), was more a cosmographer than an astronomer. As far as I am aware the 1572 nova did not directly influence his thinking, but it might certainly have encouraged it. In a 1584 work titled De L'Infinito Universo e Mondi (\"On the Infinite Universe and Worlds\"), Bruno argued that Copernicus' heliocentric theory was correct, that the sun was just one of an infinite number of similar heavenly bodies, that planets like ours revolved around many of those stars, and that inhabited \"worlds\" might exist throughout the universe. For his troubles the church had him stripped naked in the streets, fitted with a muzzle, and burned alive. (In his diary at the end of A Portrait, Stephen records a conversation with one of his Jesuit instructors, Father Ghezzi, about \"Bruno the Nolan\": \"He said Bruno was a terrible heretic. I said he was terribly burned. He agreed to this with some sorrow.\") \n Sitting on the seawall rocks, Stephen thinks of the \"roar of cataractic planets, globed, blazing, roaring wayawayawayawayawayaway,\" and then wonders whether planets like our own may exist throughout the universe: \"Why not endless till the farthest star? Darkly they are there behind this light, darkness shining in the brightness, delta of Cassiopeia, worlds.\" On one of these Brunonian \"worlds,\" he supposes, another Stephen may sit looking up at stars never seen from Earth: \"Me sits there with his augur's rod of ash, in borrowed sandals, by day beside a livid sea, unbeheld, in violet night walking beneath a reign of uncouth stars.\" The fanciful conceit reflects Bruno's belief in the transmigration of souls. \n Stephen's fantastical star-fictions continue in Scylla and Charybdis, now drawing on popular reactions to the nova. As Gifford observes, \"The supernova caused considerable imaginative excitement in Elizabethan England as a sort of Star of Bethlehem, heralding a new birth, the second coming of Christ.\" In Stephen's telling it heralded the coming of Shakespeare: \"What's in a name? That is what we ask ourselves in childhood when we write the name that we are told is ours.A star, a daystar, a firedrake, rose at his birth. It shone by day in the heavens alone, brighter than Venus in the night, and by night it shone over delta in Cassiopeia, the recumbent constellation which is the signature of his initial among the stars.\" Cassiopeia is said to be a seated queen combing her hair, though the five stars do not really suggest any such shape. Seen as a W, Shakespeare's \"initial,\" the woman is \"recumbent\"—lying prone. Stephen no doubt imagines Shakespeare thinking of some similar position recently adopted by Anne Hathaway in her bed. \n The connection between terrestrial and celestial affairs intimated in Proteus persists in this and other details. \"Firedrake\" was one name for meteors in Shakespeare's time, and Stephen implies that like meteors the nova held portentous significance for earth-dwellers. In particular, its appearance near a gigantic W inscribed in the heavens gave young William an occult hint of his greatness. Puzzled by the reference, Thomas Lyster asks, \"Was it a celestial phenomenon?,\" and Stephen suggests that the nova was a cosmically ordained sign: \"— A star by night, Stephen said. A pillar of the cloud by day.\" He is recalling God's leading of his people through the desert in Exodus 13:21: \"And the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give the light; to go by day and night.\" \n Stephen's claim is not only outlandish; it is self-consciously sophistic. Shakespeare was born in 1564, so it can hardly be said with accuracy that the new star \"rose at his birth.\" (Given Cassiopeia's perpetual presence in the northern sky, it would not even have risen!) Nor can it be said with accuracy that Shakespeare might have watched the nova during the period of his infatuation with Anne Hathaway: \"His eyes watched it, lowlying on the horizon, eastward of the bear, as he walked by the slumberous summer fields at midnight returning from Shottery and from her arms.\" There is no need for Stephen to make this claim, and his interior monologue shows that he knows it to be false: \"Don't tell them he was nine years old when it was quenched.\" He might well add, \"or that he was eight years old when it first appeared.\" His knowledge of the relevant dates is good, but his biography is a cynical fraud.\n In Ithaca, standing outside 7 Eccles Street gazing at constellations with Bloom, Stephen's astronomical conversation piece becomes amplified with some scientific details that one imagines must come either from Bloom or the narrator. The two men are said to have discussed \"the appearance of a star (1st magnitude) of exceeding brilliancy dominating by night and day (a new luminous sun generated by the collision and amalgamation in incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns) about the period of the birth of William Shakespeare over delta in the recumbent neversetting constellation of Cassiopeia.\" Perhaps Stephen does know (despite his earlier statement that the star \"rose\") that Cassiopeia is \"neversetting.\" From northern latitudes like Dublin's, the constellation's orbit around Polaris is circumpolar, never dipping below the horizon. The information in parentheses, however, seems beyond his ken.\n Star \"magnitude\" has been mentioned earlier in the same paragraph. In the reverse-order scale devised in antiquity, magnitude 1 stars were the brightest in the sky, and magnitudes \"up to and including the 7th\" were visible to the naked eye. (Authorities would disagree with \"and including.\" Perhaps Bloom is bragging about the power of his night vision.) After the scale was regularized and made logarithmic in 1856, negative numbers were introduced to account for brighter objects, so that Sirius now has a magnitude of -1.46, and the sun -27. By this way of measuring, the planet Venus is brighter than -4, so the 1572 nova might have ranked almost -5.\n The \"collision\" of two stars was one theorized explanation, still current in 1904, of how novae happened. Today, different causes are proposed: gravitational collapse in the core of a massive star, or runaway nuclear fusion in a white dwarf. But stellar collisions can produce tremendous explosions, creating heavy elements from gold and platinum to uranium (supernovae normally produce no elements heavier than iron), and it is thought that they may sometimes trigger runaway fusion in white dwarfs.\n The narrative in Ithaca reports that the two men spoke also \"of a star (2nd magnitude) of similar origin but of lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of the Corona Septentrionalis about the period of the birth of Leopold Bloom and of other stars of (presumably) similar origin which had (effectively or presumably) appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of Andromeda about the period of the birth of Stephen Dedalus, and in and from the constellation of Auriga some years after the birth and death of Rudolph Bloom, junior, and in and from other constellations some years before or after the birth or death of other persons.\" These were actual sightings of novae. In May 1866 one appeared in Corona Borealis (the Northern Crown, also called Corona Septentrionalis) and grew to magnitude 2. Another was spotted in the constellation Andromeda on 17 August 1885 and reached magnitude 5.85 four days later, before rapidly fading. Still another appeared in the constellation Auriga in 1891 and was observed at peak brightness in January and February 1892, when it had an apparent magnitude of about 4.5. \n The science is good, then, but the effort to link novae to people's birth dates displays the same tendentious inexactitude encountered in Scylla and Charybdis. The first seems close enough: Bloom was born in 1866, though the novel never specifies a month or day. Stephen, however, was presumably born, like Joyce, in early 1882, three and a half years before the sighting of the nova in Andromeda, and Rudy was born at the end of 1893, two years after the Auriga nova appeared. \n What is going on with this proliferation of novae loosely connected to the births of characters in the book? Reading between the lines, as one must do constantly in Ithaca, it seems likely that Stephen has volunteered his heavily mythologized astronomical tidbit and Bloom, who possesses some actual knowledge of astronomy, has responded by naming several other novae. If Stephen, showing Bloom an honesty he did not display in the library, has said that Tycho's new star appeared \"about the period of the birth of William Shakespeare\" (emphasis added), then Bloom, gamely playing along, may have chosen to mention novae that appeared within a few years of the births of himself, Stephen, and Rudy, as well as others seen \"after the birth or death of other persons\" who are not specified.\n Supernovae—the term was coined about a decade after the publication of Ulysses—were just beginning to be intensively studied in the second half of the 19th century. Although they are thought to occur only about twice a century in the Milky Way (and not all are observed, because of intervening objects), the development of better and better telescopes has allowed astronomers to observe them in many distant galaxies, exponentially increasing the rate at which they are discovered, as the GIF file here graphically illustrates. It is now known that supernova explosions often result in nebulae, themselves known to produce stars, planets, worlds. Joyce and his astronomical persona Bloom are onto something big."

    "note": " In Calypso Bloom recalls running to fetch the midwife from her home in \"Denzille street.\" This street holds associations with more than childbirth. It and the nearby \"Denzille lane,\" encountered in Oxen of the Sun, also evoke the militant Irish nationalism of the Phoenix Park murders in 1882—connections brought near the surface of the book's consciousness by the typically Joycean device of a strange coincidence.",
    "expandedNote": " Mary Thornton, the actual Joyce family midwife whom Joyce imported into his novel, lived at 19A Denzille Street, as Gifford and Igoe note. But in a personal communication Vincent Altman O'Connor observes that this was also the address of James Carey, the Fenian leader who turned queen's evidence during the investigation of the murders and fled Ireland under state protection in 1883, only to be assassinated by an Irish nationalist on a ship off the South African coast. \n When Bloom thinks of this notorious figure from his teen years in three different chapters of Ulysses, he has trouble remembering whether he was \"Peter or Denis or James Carey.\" Nevertheless, he seems to know quite a bit about the man's life. In Lotus Eaters he stands in one of the aisles of St. Andrew's chuch thinking about a nearby resident who was known for visiting the church every single day: \"That fellow that turned queen's evidence on the invincibles he used to receive the, Carey was his name, the communion every morning. This very church. Peter Carey. No, Peter Claver I am thinking of. Denis Carey. And just imagine that. Wife and six children at home. And plotting that murder all the time.\"\n Carey (who did have a brother named Peter, another approver of militant action) was indeed known for attending mass every day. Igoe quotes a contemporary reporter, J. B. Hall, who remarked on his \"reputation for ostentatious piety.\" Thornton describes Bloom's knowledge of Carey's family situation as \"amazingly accurate: in a London Times interview of February 20, 1883, Mrs. Carey says that they have seven children, and that the youngest is a baby two months old\" (85). In Lestrygonians Bloom thinks that he was a \"Member of the corporation too.\" Once again he is correct: Carey was elected a Councillor, and some people spoke of him as possible Lord Mayor material.\n There is a perfectly ordinary explanation for Thornton and Carey living at the same address: he likely was her landlord. (Assuming, that is, that she lived in Denzille Street before the government took him into protective custody and shipped him out of the country. If she moved in later than June 1893, then she could have rented from his heirs.) Carey had followed in the footsteps of his bricklayer father and become a successful builder and landlord, acquiring tenement properties on Denzille Street, Denzille Lane, Hamilton Row, South Cumberland Street, and South Gloucester Street. \n There is also a perfectly ordinary explanation for Bloom's knowledge of the man. Regardless of whether Mary Thornton knew Carey in person or merely heard about him from neighbors in the aftermath of his sensational departure, she may well have shared some of the details with Bloom. Whatever the source of his knowledge, Bloom has been turning the lesson of Carey's life over in his mind for a long time, admiring his nationalism, abhorring his criminal violence, envying his courage, deploring his capitulation. \n Eumaeus records this ever-shifting, parallactic ambivalence: \"turning queen's evidence—or king's now—like Denis or Peter Carey, an idea he utterly repudiated. Quite apart from that he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle. Yet, though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in any shape or form, he certainly did feel and no denying it (while inwardly remaining what he was), a certain kind of admiration for a man who had actually brandished a knife, cold steel, with the courage of his political convictions.\" \n O'Connor observes that when Bloom stands on South Cumberland Street in Lotus Eaters, tearing Martha Clifford's envelope into tiny shreds, he is only a few steps away from one of Carey’s houses where the knives from the Phoenix Park murders were found—a discovery that was widely reported in the newspapers and caused a sensation. (One of Carey's tenants in the house had seen him using a ladder to make secret trips to the attic and climbed up to see what was there. He found two long surgical amputation knives that fit the wounds inflicted in the park.) Instead of taking those few steps to gaze on Carey's house, Bloom turns into the back entrance to Saint Andrew's Church and thinks about the man there. \n At the end of Oxen of the Sun, Stephen and the other young men debouche for \"Burke's of Denzille and Holles,\" a pub at the intersection of those two streets just north of the maternity hospital. At the pub's closing hour they head back south, bound for the Westland Row train station where they will board for Monto: \"Denzille lane this way. Change here for Bawdyhouse.\" No one mentions why they fail to proceed somewhat more directly via Denzille Street, but perhaps Joyce prized the opportunity to echo a name that one of the drunkards has given their roving band, \"The Denzille lane boys.\" Gifford notes that this was \"A Dublin slang name for the Invincibles.\" It is a common kind of nickname for Dublin gangs.\n Joyce scholarship has not paid much attention to the Denzille-Invincibles nexus, but Dublin has. Denzille Street no longer exists; it became Fenian Street shortly after independence and the civil war of 1922-23."

  "030101calve": {
    "note": " \"Descende, calve, ut ne nimium decalveris\": this Latin sentence in Proteus initiates a series of further meditations on Joachim of Fiore. The sense is roughly \"Go down, bald one (repeated a sentence later as \"Get down, bald poll!\"), so that you don't become totally bald.\" Stephen is altering a sentence from the book of prophecies supposedly authored by Joachim, and it in turn alludes to an appalling Old Testament story about male pattern baldness and divine wrath. Although the exact intentions behind both allusions are exceedingly obscure, he seems to be thinking about having escaped the clutches of the priesthood.",
    "expandedNote": " The second book of Kings tells the gruesome story of some young people (the King James says \"little children,\" but the Hebrew word means \"youths\") who unwisely mocked the prophet Elisha: \"And he went up from thence unto Beth-el: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head. And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the Lord. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them\" (2:23-24). The Vulgate Bible translates the youths' taunt as ascende calve. \n Why this phrase should have found its way to the beginning of Joachim's pseudonymous series of prophecies concerning late medieval popes is unclear, but there seems to be some connection to the fact that Nicholas III (the first pope treated in the series) was a member of the Orsini family (Italian for bears). In the version of the Vaticinia shown here (and it is not unique in this way), the first prophecy represents Nicholas seated between two friendly-looking bear cubs, associating him with the prophet Elisha. The text that accompanies the illustration is highly obscure. It begins \"Ascende, calve, ut ne amplius decalveris, qui non vereris decalvere sponsam: ut comam ursae nutrias\" (\"Go up, bald one, lest you be made more bald, you who are not afraid to make your wife bald: so that you nourish the hair of the she-bear\"). \n Stephen's alterations to the beginning of this sentence, changing \"Go up\" to \"Go down\" and \"more\" (amplius) to \"excessively\" (nimium), also are hard to fathom. Is he imperfectly remembering what he read? Or deliberately changing the meaning somehow? (Thornton notes that Joyce had amplius in the version of the chapter that he published in the Little Review. He changed it before publishing the complete novel.)\n What does seem clear is that 1) Stephen thinks of Joachim (not Elisha) as bald, associating him with the balding priest in the swimming hole at the end of Telemachus (\"garland of gray hair\"); 2) he thinks of Joachim as having been threatened with censure by the church (\"his comminated head\"); and 3) he sees Joachim as a version of himself, the Stephen who could have entered the priesthood (\"see him me clambering down to the footpace (descende!), clutching a monstrance, basiliskeyed\"). \n To comminate is to threaten with divine punishment. Gifford notes that although Joachim's teachings were never declared heretical during his lifetime, \"some were condemned by the Lateran Council of 1215,\" and a papal commission censured one of his ardent advocates in 1255 while sparing Joachim. A monstrance, in the Catholic church, is a vessel in which the consecrated host of the Eucharist is displayed (it comes from monstrare = to show). A footpace is a platform or raised section of floor, as below an altar (dictionary.reference.com gives as an example, \"The altar, where a weekly requiem had been said for them, was gone, and the footpace and piscina alone showed where it had stood\"). The basilisk is a legendary serpent or dragon whose gaze can kill. \n Stephen seems to be comparing himself to Joachim as another genius involved with the church, just as he compares himself to Swift as another genius with the misfortune to be born Irish. Both involvements (Catholicism, Ireland) lead to torturing madness. Has Joachim's genius been reduced to the performance of a mere rite? Are his bald head and the murderous look in his eyes images of what Stephen could have become if he had answered the priestly vocation? \n In A Portrait Stephen's decision not to answer the call is significantly motivated by thoughts of what the priests look like: \"The Reverend Stephen Dedalus, S. J. / His name in that new life leaped into characters before his eyes and to it there followed a mental sensation of an undefined face or colour of a face. The colour faded and became strong like a changing glow of pallid brick red. Was it the raw reddish glow he had so often seen on wintry mornings on the shaven gills of the priests? The face was eyeless and sourfavoured and devout, shot with pink tinges of suffocated anger\" (174-75). Stephen associates this face with Father Richard Campbell, the Jesuit priest that he has thought of just before saying \"Descende\" to Joachim. \n Although the meditation on men becoming bald and bears ripping children to shreds is as obscure as anything in Ulysses, it seems clear that Stephen is viewing Joachim as a man of the church who has descended into anger as a result of his joyless institutional commitment. These thoughts return in Wandering Rocks, when Stephen is perusing a book of holy charms about how to win a woman's love: \"As good as any other abbot's charms, as mumbling Joachim's. Down, baldynoddle, or we'll wool your wool.\""

  "140032deshileamus": {
    "note": " Joyce said that Oxen of the Sun would develop embryonically through a chronological succession of prose styles inspired by writers of English prose. Here at the beginning, he starts in the style of Latin hymns from the time before England was English. The three percussive paragraphs beginning with \"Deshil Holles Eamus\"—a phrase compounded from three languages meaning something like \"Let us go rightward to Holles Street\"—are chanted in a style suggestive of late Roman fertility rites. Throughout this chapter, whenever there seems to be a distinct change, notes beginning with the heading \"New Style\" will seek to characterize the sources, properties, and purposes of the governing style of the moment.",
    "expandedNote": " According to Stuart Gilbert's James Joyce's Ulysses (1930), Joyce wrote the first three paragraphs \"in the manner of the Fratres Arvales\" (277). The Arval Brothers were a so-called college of twelve Roman priests who conducted ceremonies dedicated to the Lares, Dea Dia, Ceres, and other gods concerned with fertility and good harvests. Thornton and Gifford, citing evidence uncovered in Theodor Mommsen's History of Rome (1887), add that the ceremonies involved an incantatory hymn written in the early 200s AD, most of whose lines sounded three times (I.294). The hymn concluded with a Triumphe or \"Hurrah,\" which Joyce imitates with \"Hoopsa.\"\n Joyce's representation of the evolution of English prose is interesting on many levels, not least in celebrating, and undermining, the language of the conqueror. The chapter starts with three sections (the triply triune chant, a paragraph about valuing fertility, and two more paragraphs about Irish medicine and hospitals) that read like very rough translations of Latin into English. The chant's opening word evokes the Celtic languages of early Britain and Ireland. \n \"Deshil\" is an Anglicization of the Irish deasil(or deasal or deisiol), meaning \"turning to the right\" or \"turning toward the sun.\" Joyce may have found it in P. W. Joyce's A Social History of Ancient Ireland (2 vols., London and Dublin, 1913, first published in shorter versions in 1903 and 1906). Gifford cites this work as authority for the word's use as \"a ritual gesture to attract good fortune, and an act of consecration when repeated three times\" (vol. 1, p. 301). Slote, who detects many other debts to Joyce's Social History in the opening paragraphs of Oxen, instead quotes here from the OED: \"towards the right...in the same direction as the hands of a clock, or the apparent course of the sun (a practice held auspicious by the Celts).\" \"Eamus\" is Latin for \"Let us go,\" so Deshil Eamus means something like \"Let us turn ceremonially to the right\"—or toward the sun, which, though gone from the sky at 10 PM, does figure prominently in the chapter's second paragraph as a god dedicated to fertility.\n Where? to \"Holles\" Street, where Dublin's National Maternity Hospital is located. This place consecrated to facilitating childbirth will be the site where the mysteries of fertility are played out. Slote suggests that Deshil Holles may also echo Denzil Holles, the Earl of Clare, after whom the street was named. At the end of Oxen, the young men spill out of the hospital and walk past \"Denzille lane\" to Burke's pub on the corner of Holles Street and Denzille Street.\n This and subsequent style notes are marked with blue hyperlinks at the beginning of new sections. My use of blue links rather than orange ones reflects my decision to focus somewhat more on the styles adopted in Joyce's prose than on particular literary works that he echoed. Weldon Thornton, whose book is titled Allusions in Ulysses (2nd ed., 1968), notes that \"This episode poses unique problems for an allusion study, since its style echoes and recapitulates various English styles from Anglo-Saxon literature to modern slang and evangelical oratory, and since Joyce apparently used certain books on English style and literary history as sources for some of the material in the episode. Thus the line between an allusion to a specific work and a parody of a period style is difficult to trace, as is the difference between an allusion to a certain work and Joyce's use of a source that may have included that work\" (323). \n Given his choice of subject matter, and the fact that Robert Janusko was simultaneously working on the complicated process by which Joyce leafed through anthologies of English prose, recorded phrases from various authors on notesheets, and deployed his borrowings in stylistic pastiches that did not confine themselves to single authors, Thornton settled on a policy \"to exclude a 'style' as an allusion, except when Joyce seems to have some specific work in mind. I have also chosen to avoid the study of Joyce's sources and keep the list for this chapter (as for others) focused on allusions present in the final text\" (323). \n My aim here is different. Although many of my notes will concentrate on individual authors and/or literary works (and thus could be marked by orange links), the central purpose of all these notes is to describe Joyce's composition of a sequence of distinctive styles, often echoing phrases from multiple authors and multiple periods of literary history in a way that makes hash of the idea of a single \"allusion.\" The nearly three dozen such styles found in his finished text do evoke particular dead writers and particular published works, but more strikingly still they show James Joyce having a hell of a lot of fun with the possibilities of English prose."

  "180010dewy": {
    "note": " When Molly thinks that taking Stephen's semen in her mouth wouldn't be so bad, \"even if some of it went down,\" she searches for equivalents: \"what its only like gruel or the dew.\" The first comparison seems apt enough, given watery oatmeal's color and texture, but why would Molly think of dew? It turns out that Joyce has made the association between semen and dew twice before, in Nausicaa and Oxen of the Sun, and arguably in A Portrait of the Artist as well. In all of these passages the linkage seems to be more intellectual than sensory: dew is refreshing and life-giving, and it has an affinity with intangible spiritual essences.",
    "expandedNote": " The poem that Stephen composes in part 5 of A Portrait comes to him after one of those rapturous dreams that sometimes happen just before waking: \"Towards dawn he awoke. O what sweet music! His soul was all dewy wet. Over his limbs in sleep pale cool waves of light had passed. He lay still, as if his soul lay amid cool waters, conscious of faint sweet music. His mind was waking slowly to a tremulous morning knowledge, a morning inspiration. A spirit filled him, pure as the purest water, sweet as dew, moving as music. But how faintly it was inbreathed, how passionlessly, as if the seraphim themselves were breathing upon him! His soul was waking slowly, fearing to awake wholly.\"\n In Dublin's Joyce (1956), Hugh Kenner reads this scene, counter-intuitively but plausibly, as the aftermath of a wet dream (123). The prose speaks only of spiritual realities: inspiration, radiance, \"enchantment,\" \"a dream or vision,\" \"the ecstasy of seraphic life.\" But one detail does evoke sexuality, albeit wrapped in gauzy religious tissue: \"O! In the virgin womb of the imagination the word was made flesh. Gabriel the seraph had come to the virgin's chamber.\" Stephen is the virgin here (a budding poet, about to conceive), but the analogy suggests a sexual dimension to his state of mind, and his thoughts turn immediately afterward to eros. Poetry is born in him when the \"white flame\" of inspiration deepens to \"a rose and ardent light\" suggestive of the \"strange wilful heart\" of a woman who has lured the angels down from heaven. One of the tercets of the villanelle reads, \"Your eyes have set man's heart ablaze / And you have had your will of him. / Are you not weary of ardent ways?\"\n Christian mythology holds that an angel descended from heaven to impregnate the Blessed Virgin. In the first chapter of Ulysses Mulligan makes a mockery of this Annunciation—\"My mother's a jew, my father's a bird\"—and in Proteus Stephen thinks of how the French satirist Léo Taxil did the same thing, imagining Mary having been impregnated by a randy pigeon. But the dream passage in A Portrait of the Artist applies the paradigm quite chastely to the fusion of sexuality and spirituality experienced by the writer of a love poem, and Stephen's image of being \"all dewy wet\" carries over into the later novel. Like the seraphim, dew falls from the heavens, bringing new life to earth. Ulysses maintains this metaphorical suggestion while making the moisture explicitly sexual. \n In Nausicaa Joyce maps the mounting sexual excitement of Bloom and Gerty onto the fireworks display that both are watching from Sandymount Strand. The moment of climax comes as sparkling stars shoot from a Roman candle and fall from the evening sky: \"She would fain have cried to him chokingly, held out her snowy slender arms to him to come, to feel his lips laid on her white brow, the cry of a young girl's love, a little strangled cry, wrung from her, that cry that has rung through the ages. And then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and O! then the Roman candle burst and it was like a sigh of O! and everyone cried O! O! in raptures and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah! they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden, O so lovely! O, so soft, sweet, soft!\" The evanscent celestial radiance of A Portrait is here a physical phenomenon, gushing from a phallic cylinder.\n The following chapter, Oxen of the Sun, builds upon this conflation of the spiritual and the sexual. With Mrs. Purefoy's baby born, and the bars due to close soon, the young men pour out of the hospital into night air livened by recent rain: \"The air without is impregnated with raindew moisture,life essence celestial, glistering on Dublin stone there under starshiny coelum. God's air, the Allfather's air, scintillant circumambient cessile air. Breathe it deep into thee. By heaven, Theodore Purefoy, thou hast done a doughty deed and no botch! Thou art, I vow, the remarkablest progenitor barring none in this chaffering allincluding most farraginous chronicle. Astounding! In her lay a Godframed Godgiven preformed possibility which thou hast fructified with thy modicum of man's work. Cleave to her! Serve! Toil on, labour like a very bandog and let scholarment and all Malthusiasts go hang. Thou art all their daddies, Theodore. Art drooping under thy load, bemoiled with butcher's bills at home and ingots (not thine!) in the countinghouse? Head up! For every newbegotten thou shalt gather thy homer of ripe wheat. See, thy fleece is drenched.\" \n The biblical bushels of nourishing grain that will compensate Mr. Purefoy for his costly begetting (the omer, or \"sheaf,\" was an ancient Hebrew unit of dry measure) are coupled, in these closing sentences, with the heaven-sent moisture that makes plants grow. Dew specifically suggests divine approval. In the book of Judges, Gideon says to his God, \"If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said, Behold I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; and if the dew be on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the earth beside, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as thou hast said. And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water\" (6:36-38). In these verses dew signifies God's good will toward his nation Israel. In Oxen, by extension, the glistening night air proclaims the divine purpose that has been fulfilled in the maternity hospital: bringing new life into the world. The entire chapter has urged this linkage between procreation and divine approval, and now the linkage is concretized in the association of three fluids: the \"raindew moisture\" that clings to Dubin's streets, the dew that drenched Gideon's fleece, and the seed which Theodore Purefoy sprinkled on his wife's womb. \n In Joyce and Reality: The Empirical Strikes Back (2004), John Gordon briefly remarks on the connection between dew and semen in these four passages and notes one interesting quasi-scientific belief that may have reinforced it in Joyce's mind (26). Ithaca refers to \"the continual production of semen by distillation,\" using the same word that it has earlier applied to dew: \"saturation of air, distillation of dew.\" This sounds reminiscent of early modern humors theories inherited from Aristotle, Hippocrates, and Galen. In Thicker Than Water: The Origins of Blood as Symbol and Ritual (2014), Melissa Meyer writes of the ancient theories that \"All bodily fluids were distilled from blood. Both sexes produced semen. Male sperm was refined from blood, journeyed to the brain, and then flowed downward through the spinal column, the kidneys, and testicles before being ejaculated. Female semen was more like menstrual blood. Heat was transformative. Men had enough heat to refine blood into semen and then on to the supreme form, sperm\" (59). \n Whatever pseudoscience may be responsible for the notion that semen is produced \"by distillation,\" the effect is to suggest that it is somehow purified, refined. If it is \"pure as the purest water, sweet as dew\" (Stephen's words in A Portrait), then Molly has nothing to fear from fellatio."

    "note": " Picking his nose at the end of Proteus, Stephen reaches for \"My handkerchief. He threw it. I remember. Did I not take it up? / His hand groped vainly in his pockets. No, I didn't. Better buy one.\" The narrative here is artful not only in not representing Stephen's nose-picking (he seems to be largely unaware of his body, and his urination a minute earlier has also been represented very obliquely), but also in not representing, much earlier, his not picking up the handkerchief that Mulligan (\"He\") laid down for him. This non-action in Telemachus occurs just before Mulligan throws Stephen's hat out on the floor, and the response: \"Stephen picked it up and put it on.\" Careful readers will also notice a connection to a question that Bloom asks in Calypso: \"Where is my hat, by the way? Must have put it back on the peg.\"",
    "expandedNote": " In Telemachus Mulligan borrows Stephen's handkerchief to wipe his razor. When he takes off his dressing gown quite some time later, he empties the contents of the pockets onto a table and points them out to Stephen: \"— There's your snotrag, he said.\" Rummaging through his trunk to find a clean handkerchief, he comes across something else that belongs to Stephen: \"A limp black missile flew out of his talking hands. / And there's your Latin quarter hat, he said. / Stephen picked it up and put it on.\" It is clear in context that Stephen has noticed and retrieved the hat but has not done the same with the handkerchief, perhaps because he was distracted by the hat. Or rather it would be clear to any reader who had the supremely myopic gaze to notice such things while navigating the first chapter. Not until the end of the third chapter does Joyce suggest that it would have been a good idea to be paying such close attention.\n Ulysses, an edifice built of incredibly precise details, is as interesting for those that it omits as for those that it includes. The following chapter, Calypso, affords several examples, starting with the minor curiosity that the Blooms live at a precise address which is never mentioned in the chapter, building to the more interesting fact that Bloom cannot remember what he has done with his hat, and concluding with the major retrospective mystery that the 8-9 hour must have ended with an unnarrated conversation in which Molly disclosed the time of Boylan's visit."

  "070024differentchurches": {
    "note": " From atop the pillar, the two women in Stephen's story \"see the roofs and argue about where the different churches are: Rathmines' blue dome, Adam and Eve's, saint Laurence O'Toole's.\" Looking for such landmarks suggests that Anne Kearns and Florence MacCabe are pious women, but since church spires and domes made up most of the landmarks on Dublin's 1904 skyline, the religious focus may be adventitious. One may also ask why Stephen has chosen these particular churches. The primary reason would seem to be geographic: their divergent angles from the pillar let him evoke the panoramic view that the two women get by walking about the square viewing platform at the top of the pillar. It is remotely possible, though, that Irish political and military history may play a part, since all three churches are associated with English rule and Irish resistance.",
    "expandedNote": " As far as I know there are no photographs from the top of the pillar that show the churches that Stephen mentions. But all three are still standing. \"Rathmines' blue dome\" is a church called Our Lady of Refuge (more fully, Church of Mary Immaculate, Refuge of Sinners) in the suburb of Rathmines, just beyond the Grand Canal about three kilometers south of the pillar. The blue appearance (many observers would have called it green) came from a large oxidized copper dome. A catastrophic fire destroyed the church in 1920 and the entire heavy dome smashed down through its supports, but insurance money enabled quick rebuilding. The beautiful new dome, completed in 1923, is taller and more elaborate than its predecessor, but it too was designed to weather to a blue-green hue, and it continues to provide a striking visual landmark. \n \"Adam and Eve's,\" known more formally as the Church of the Immaculate Conception of Our Lady, is an old Franciscan church that figures prominently in Finnegans Wake: \"riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay.\" These opening words evoke the water flowing past Merchant's Quay on the south bank of the Liffey. The church lies just off that street, slightly more than a kilometer west-southwest of the pillar. It too has a blue-green dome, but Stephen does not mention that fact. \n The last church he thinks of, \"saint Laurence O'Toole's,\"\nis a Gothic Revival limestone structure built in the 1840s and 50s several blocks north of what in Joyce's time were working docklands on the Liffey, and about one and a half kilometers east-northeast of the pillar. Its majestic four-stage tower and spire, at the entrance to the nave, command views in the area and were said to be the last landmark seen by emigrants leaving Ireland from the North Wall.\n To see these three churches at various points on the skyline (south, west-southwest, east-northeast), Anne and Flo must be walking around the viewing platform—a neat trick of suggesting movement non-narratively. But Stephen may also be subtly weaving a political thread into the story. Two of the churches would have carried patriotic associations for any Irish nationalist. Lorcán Ua Tuathail, later \"saint Laurence O'Toole,\" was a 12th century monk who became the first Irishman elected Archbishop of Dublin, a town ruled by Danes and Norwegians. He was canonized by Pope Honorius III in 1225, and later became Dublin's patron saint because, as archbishop at the time of the Norman invasions, he protected the city's inhabitants, using the respect and trust he inspired in all who met him to obtain clemency from the bloodthirsty knights besieging his city. \n \"Adam and Eve's\" gained its colloquial name because, when Catholic religious observances were prohibited by penal laws in the 18th and early 19th centuries, the Franciscans secretly held Mass for worshipers who entered through the Adam and Eve Tavern next door to the church. Joyce mentions the church's services in Cyclops, when the narrator despises Bob Doran for \"talking against the Catholic religion,and he serving mass in Adam and Eve’s when he was young with his eyes shut, who wrote the new testament, and the old testament.\" Ithaca alludes specifically to the surreptitious masses of earlier times when Stephen and Bloom find a spiritual bond in belonging to despised faith communities: \"their dispersal, persecution, survival and revival: the isolation of their synagogical and ecclesiastical rites in ghetto (S. Mary’s Abbey) and masshouse (Adam and Eve’s tavern): the proscription of their national costumes in penal laws and jewish dress acts: the restoration in Chanah David of Zion and the possibility of Irish political autonomy or devolution.\"\n As for the Rathmines church, the question of \"political autonomy\" (republican independence) or \"devolution\" (greater self-rule within the British empire) that dominated Irish political discourse in the early 20th century impacted that sacred space dramatically in January 1920. For some time, members of the Dublin IRA, assisted by a church official who belonged to \"A\" Company, had slept in the church whenever police came looking for them at their houses (making it, as Frank McNally pointed out in an Irish Times column a couple of years ago, a Refuge of Shinners). When the great fire broke out, it became difficult to conceal the fact that \"A\" Company had also been storing large quantities of weapons and ammunition in the church's vaults. \n An article dated 5 August 2013 on the Dublin history blog Come Here to Me!, written by Donal and indebted to a 2012 book by Las Fallon titled Dublin Fire Brigade and the Irish Revolution, describes the chaotic scene that resulted: firemen furiously pumping water from the Grand Canal, the church's dome threatening to come crashing down, and republican soldiers rushing into the burning building to retrieve munitions. After the fire was extinguished, there was fear that British authorities might find remaining arms during clean-up operations, so IRA man Michael Lynch (according to testimony he gave to the Bureau of Military History) went to talk to DFB Captain John Myers, whom he knew to be \"a very fine fellow and, from the national point of view, thoroughly sound and reliable in every way.\" Myers assured Lynch that no one would ever know about any guns found in the rubble, and he was true to his word. \n This history, only recently compiled, may well be dismissed as something that Joyce, in his distant continental exile, could not possibly have heard about. But on this, as on so many other points, Ulysses gives its readers just enough telling details to make them question their incredulity. In Circe, when Bloom is sentenced to death by the Inquisition, the sentence is carried out by the Dublin Fire Brigade, led by Myers:\n THE FIRE BRIGADE Pflaap! \n BROTHER BUZZ\n (Invests Bloom in a yellow habit with embroidery of painted flames and high pointed hat. He places a bag of gunpowder round his neck and hands him over to the civil power, saying.) Forgive him his trespasses. \n (Lieutenant Myers of the Dublin Fire Brigade by general request sets fire to Bloom. Lamentations.) \n THE CITIZEN Thank heaven! \n BLOOM\n (In a seamless garment marked I. H. S. stands upright amid phoenix flames.) Weep not for me, O daughters of Erin. \n (He exhibits to Dublin reporters traces of burning. The daughters of Erin, in black garments, with large prayerbooks and long lighted candles in their hands, kneel down and pray.) \n Catholic church services, a stash of gunpowder, Dublin Fire Brigade troops, and John Myers: the coalescence of these details must, at a minimum, be deemed a very strange coincidence. If Joyce did intend for his three churches to carry nationalist associations, he could not have chosen a more opportune vantage than Nelson's Pillar, a symbol of British military might towering over a street identified withIreland's foremost promoter of Catholic rights. O'Connell's political career represented one long assault on the penal laws of Nelson's era. His statue at the bottom of the street challenged Nelson's statue in front of the Post Office. And Stephen's three \"different churches\" in Aeolus may possibly be speaking back to the tower from which they are viewed."

  "040060dlugacz": {
    "note": " There was no \"Dlugacz\" on Dorset Street in 1904. Every other shopowner in Ulysses appears in the 1905Thom's Directory, but Joyce named the butcher after a Jewish intellectual whom he knew in Trieste, because of the Zionism that Dlugacz passionately espoused. When Bloom infers in Calypso that the butcher is Jewish (\"I thought he was\"), and sees that the recognition is mutual, he appears to feel drawn to the man but saves his greeting for another day. Later in the chapter he dismisses Dlugacz's Zionism with the thought, \"Enthusiast.\"",
    "expandedNote": " Like another Jewish intellectual, Ettore Schmitz (Italo Svevo), Moses Dlugacz (1884-1943) was one of Joyce's students at the Berlitz school in Trieste. In The Jews of Ireland, Louis Hyman notes that the two men \"had a common interest in literature and etymology, music and philosophy. The son and grandson of Ukrainian rabbis and himself an ordained rabbi in his fifteenth year, Dlugacz became Joyce's pupil in English on his appointment in 1912 to the post of chief cashier in the local Cunard Line office\" (184). When war broke out in 1914, he lost his Cunard position and opened a small grocery store and wholesale food business.\n Hyman observes that \"Dlugacz tried to win over to the Zionist cause all Jews and Gentiles with whom he came in contact; no doubt he tried to make a convert of Joyce, who, discussing theIrish revival with Padraic Colum in 1903, remarked contemptuously 'I dislike all enthusiasms,' and who seems, in this instance, too, to have remained unsympathetic. Dlugacz organised and voluntarily directed courses in Hebrew and Jewish history for the Triestine Jewish youth, and perhaps gave Hebrew lessons to Joyce, who is reported to have studied the language\" (184). Several years later, Dlugacz began promoting emigration to Palestine, and in 1921 he attended the twelfth Zionist Congress in Carlsbad (185). \n When Bloom pays for his kidney, having stood for some time reading a Zionist ad with obvious interest, the gaze of the \"ferreteyed porkbutcher\" communicates recognition that Bloom too may be Jewish: \"A speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him. He withdrew his gaze after an instant. No: better not: another time.\" Bloom declines to initiate ethnic camaraderie, and after reading the Agendath Netaim ad he thinks, \"Nothing doing.\" By making his butcher deal in pork, and having him wrap this unclean meat in pages promoting a Zionist settlement, Joyce compounds Bloom's lack of piety and \"enthusiasm\" with some of his own. Nevertheless, the meeting with Dlugacz sets Bloom's mind off on a chain of reflections on old Jewish friends, old Jewish texts, and the ancient Jewish people. His ancestral homeland clearly calls to him, and the allure of Zion will recur regularly in Ulysses as one aspect of the book's symbolic concern with home rule."

    "note": " In proclaiming that \"Ireland expects that every man this day will do his duty,\" Mulligan mockingly perverts the famous call to battle of Great Britain’s great naval leader, Admiral Horatio Nelson, into a call to imbibe intoxicating beverages.",
    "expandedNote": " Nelson commanded the British fleet in the battle of Trafalgar in 1805, a naval engagement off the coast of Spain that wrested control of the seas from Napoleon and secured England from the threat of French invasion. As the battle was about to commence, the admiral’s flagship HMS Victory hoisted signal flags conveying the message, “England expects that every man will do his duty”—a text that was slightly altered in 1811 to “England expects that every man this day will do his duty,” to fit the meter of a patriotic song by John Braham commemorating the victory.\n The courageous Nelson, who had lost an arm and an eye in earlier battles, was shot to death near the end of the decisive engagement at Trafalgar, heightening the appeal of his stirring message. In 1904 a statue of him stood atop a massive pillar in the center of Sackville Street, the main thoroughfare in Dublin—as another does to this day in Trafalgar Square in London. Irish attitudes toward his great military accomplishment differ considerably from those of the English, however; on March 8, 1966 a bomb planted by the IRA destroyed the upper half of Nelson’s pillar and threw his statue to the ground. Mulligan’s patriotic aversion takes the form of mocking Nelson’s message of stiff-upper-lip militarism. Like the countercultural American rebels of the 1960s who urged their countrymen to “Make love not war,” Mulligan suggests that it is the duty of every good Irishman to hoist a pint every day (if not considerably more often). \n As so often in Joyce’s comical writing, however, the irony is not simple or stable; Irish drinking is itself ironically undermined by the comparison to British militarism. Like the Royal Navy, the pub culture of Ireland contains an element of coercive conformity. Visitors to a pub in 1904 might expect to be “treated” to a round by a friend whose pockets were not empty, and then, if their own pockets were not empty, to treat others to a round of drinks in turn. The alcoholism, poverty, domestic strife, and social irresponsibility cultivated by this tradition of unending drinks led to anti-treating leagues in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, comparable to the prohibition movement of the same era in the United States. Joyce was very far from being a teetotaler, but he recognized the corrosive effects of the custom and painted a devastating portrait of them in the story Counterparts. In Ulysses, Mulligan’s reaction to Stephen's receiving his pay for a month's labor—\"We'll have a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids\"—is only the first of many glimpses of alcoholic excess. Leopold Bloom’s heroism consists in part in his indulging only moderately in alcohol while others are losing themselves in drink. \n Bloom also dissents from most expressions of ardent nationalism. In Eumaeus, he recalls Nelson’s famous expression when thinking about the Irish “harbourmasters and coastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid the elements, whatever the season when duty called Ireland expects that every man and so on.” This subsumption of Irish duty within the British imperial system coheres with the position he takes on the political disagreement in the cabman’s shelter: he believes that armed resistance is futile given the dominance of British power. Earlier in the same paragraph, he thinks of the sea, “as a casual glance at the map revealed, it covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly what it meant, to rule the waves.” \n JH 2011"

  "030136dogofmyenemy": {
    "note": " Having already thought once in Proteus of a line from King Lear, Stephen remembers another when the dog on the beach briefly runs toward him: \"Dog of my enemy.\" The phrase conveys the sense of dismay that Cordelia feels at her father's vulnerable condition, but also her compassion for him. For Stephen, the vulnerability is his own.",
    "expandedNote": " Cordelia returns from France to find her father friendless, homeless, feeble, and deranged. She marvels that her own family members could have turned such an old man out of doors to face a raging storm:\n Mine enemy's dog,\n Though he had bit me, should have stood that night\n Against my fire, and wast thou fain, poor father,\n To hovel thee with swine and rogues forlorn\n In short and musty straw? (4.7.35-39) \n Stephen is no Lear, but Cordelia's imagination of being bitten by a dog, combined with her apprehension for her father, may express his feelings as the dog runs toward him. Like Joyce himself, who was \"badly bitten\" (Stanislaus Joyce, My Brother's Keeper, 4) by a dog when he was only five years old and walked with an ashplant all his adult life to ward off future attacks, Stephen has a morbid fear of dogs. He has thought two paragraphs earlier, \"Lord, is he going to attack me? Respect his liberty. You will not be master of others or their slave. I have my stick. Sit tight.\" \n This feeling of vulnerability is no doubt the main reason for Stephen's recollection of the phrase. But he may also feel attuned to Cordelia's compassion for the animal. She thinks of the dog as a metaphorical equivalent for her father, and it is a good metaphor. Lear has behaved rabidly toward her, and has wounded her as grievously as he can. The forgiveness that she would show to an unruly canine on an ugly night is forgiveness that she is prepared to show to her formerly vicious father. For Stephen, who does not want to master other creatures or be their slave, Cordelia's kind forbearance may be something to live up to as he faces the dog. If so, then he may have more in common with the animal-sympathizing Bloom than immediately meets the eye."

  "010047dogsbody": {
    "note": " Using some British slang to describe his tattered companion, Mulligan condescendingly exclaims, \"Ah, poor dogsbody!\" A dogsbody is an individual at the bottom of the institutional pecking order who is assigned the boring, menial, or unpleasant tasks that no one else wants to do. Close American equivalents are “gofer,” “grunt,” and “drudge.” But Stephen takes the phrase literally, sparking a series of meditations on dogs' bodies.",
    "expandedNote": " Mulligan means the \"poor\" part literally enough. He couples his ribbing with offers of charitable assistance: \"I must give you a shirt and a few noserags. How are the secondhand breeks?\" But Stephen, who is all too familiar with lice crawling on his body, has his own way of hearing \"dogsbody.\" Soon after Mulligan gives him the name, he thinks, “Who chose this face for me? This dogsbody to rid of vermin.\" \n Brooding on the equivalence man = dog, the narrative will hatch numerous connections between the bodies of dogs and those of men. And since the Christian doctrines of incarnation and transubstantiation assert connections between the bodies of men and the spiritual presence of God (as in Christ's \"This is my body you eat\"), a further dyslexic equivalence is implied: dog = god. In one passage of Circe, backward writing turns God into Dog, and \"Dooooooooooog!\" back into \"Goooooooooood!\"\n In Proteus, Stephen contemplates two dogs on the beach, one living and one dead. Like the living dog, he pisses in the open in this episode, and he thinks of the animal on remarkably equal terms: “Lord, is he going to attack me? Respect his liberty. You will not be master of others or their slave.” If dogs are not essentially different from men, then their mortality should not be thought about in fundamentally different ways. The dead dog in Proteus anticipates the drowned man in Dublin Bay, whose decaying body Stephen contemplates at the end of the episode. \n When the live dog encounters the dead one and recognizes a \"brother,\" Stephen feels kinship too: \"Dogskull, dogsniff, eyes on the ground, moves to one great goal. Ah, poor dogsbody! Here lies poor dogsbody’s body.\" The great goal recalls Mr. Deasy’s philosophizing in Nestor, but Stephen does not see life moving toward a Christian or Hegelian \"manifestation of God.\" It is moving toward death, decomposition, and reconstitution: \"God becomes man becomes fish becomes barnacle goose becomes featherbed mountain. Dead breaths I living breathe, tread dead dust, devour a urinous offal from all dead.\" If this reasoning affords no exit from the material universe, it nevertheless does allow for the possibility of spiritual presence within material beings: animals, men, and such divinity as may exist all swim in the same circle."

  "040041dolphinsbarn": {
    "note": " \"Dolphin's Barn\" is an area on the southwest edge of inner Dublin, named for the Dolphyn family who apparently had a barn there when it had not yet been swallowed by the metropolis. Molly was living in the area with her father when she and Bloom first met, and he remembers being with her at a party \"In Luke Doyle's long ago. Dolphin's Barn, the charades.\" This encounter at the Doyle family house was one of their earliest meetings, and after the charades Bloom kissed her. Dolphin's Barn also figures in the Martha Clifford intrigue, because that is where she receives mail, and possibly lives. And it has a Jewish connection: Dublin's Orthodox Jewish cemetery has been located there on Aughavannagh Road since 1898.",
    "expandedNote": " Ithaca gives Brian Tweedy's address in Dublin as \"Rehoboth, Dolphin's Barn.\" This might refer to several different streets in the area (Rehoboth Avenue, Rehoboth Terrace, and Rehoboth Place are all present-day addresses, and Gifford mentions a Rehoboth Road), but Molly pins it down in Penelope: \"the first night ever we met when I was living in Rehoboth terrace we stood staring at one another for about 10 minutes as if we met somewhere.\" \n That first meeting was almost certainly at Mat Dillon's house, but Bloom also thinks of Molly staring at him as he enacted Rip Van Winkle in the charades at Luke Doyle's place: \"Rip van Winkle we played. Rip: tear in Henny Doyle's overcoat. Van: breadvan delivering. Winkle: cockles and periwinkles. Then I did Rip van Winkle coming back. She leaned on the sideboard watching. Moorish eyes.\" In Penelope Molly remembers \"the night he kissed my heart at Dolphins barn I couldn't describe it simply makes you feel like nothing on earth.\" Ithaca observes that this consequential encounter kept Bloom up all night: \"Once, in 1887, after a protracted performance of charades in the house of Luke Doyle, Kimmage, he had awaited with patience the apparition of the diurnal phenomenon, seated on a wall, his gaze turned in the direction of Mizrach, the east.\"\n Kimmage is a separate suburb nearly a mile south of Dolphin's Barn. It is not clear why Joyce should have located Doyle in both places, though perhaps he had in mind an address located somewhere in between. In The Chronicle of Leopold and Molly Bloom, John Henry Raleigh observes that Clive Hart and Leo Knuth \"say there was a real Luke Doyle, a building surveyor, who lived at Camac Place, more properly described as being in Dolphin's Barn, rather than in Kimmage\" (85). The fictional couple at that address were \"Luke and Caroline Doyle,\" whom Ithaca mentions as having given the Blooms a wedding present. \"Henny Doyle,\" whose torn overcoat Bloom used as a charades clue, may have been one of their grown children, or perhaps Luke's brother. Molly thinks of him in Penelope as \"an unlucky man\" who was always \"breaking or tearing something in the charades.\"\n Both Lestrygonians and Ithaca mention Martha Clifford's address \"c/o P. O. / Dolphin's barn lane,\" and in Sirens Bloom writes to her there. But he recognizes that she may be using a post office box to shield her actual place of residence, just as he is. Reflecting on the name \"Gerty\" that he heard attached to his latest fancy in Nausicaa, he subjects it to same skeptical scrutiny that he gives \"Martha\": \"Might be false name however like my name and the address Dolphin's barn a blind.\""

    "expandedNote": " Which begs the question of why Stephen may be lapsing into Scottish idiom at this moment. The likely explanation is that Deasy is an Ulsterman, and much of Ulster was settled by Scottish emigrants in the 17th century. As a Unionist from the North, embued with the Protestant ethos of making and saving money, Deasy figures in Stephen's consciousness as a Scotsman. \n Ellmann identifies the real-life model model for Mr. Deasy, Francis Irwin, as an \"Ulster Scot, very pro-British,\" and he observes that the name Deasy is \"oddly inappropriate for an Ulster Scot\" (33). But Deasy is a common name in Angus county in Scotland, tracing back to the Picts, and some Deasys did move to Ireland."

  "090009donquixote": {
    "note": " In addition to the more obvious literary models for the protagonists of Ulysses found in the Greek Odyssey, the English Hamlet, and the Italian Divine Comedy, it may make sense to ponder also the Spanish Don Quixote. In a stray remark in Scylla and Charybdis, someone suggests that \"Our national epic\" will be written by drawing inspiration from this hugely influential early novel. Stephen, who has been thinking about how Shakespeare exemplifies the creative process, may well take the hint if he becomes the artist he aspires to be.",
    "expandedNote": "In the library the other four men chat about the Irish literary scene while Stephen, feeling excluded, listens in. Someone, probably John Eglinton, mentions \"Miss Mitchell's joke about Moore and Martyn,\" that George Moore is Edward Martyn's \"wild oats.\" This person goes on to remark that \"they remind one of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza. Our national epic has yet to be written, Dr Sigerson says. Moore is the man for it. A knight of the rueful countenance here in Dublin. With a saffron kilt? O'Neill Russell? O, yes, he must speak the grand old tongue. And his Dulcinea? James Stephens is doing some clever sketches. We are becoming important, it seems.\" This meta-fictive envisioning of a source of great national pride predicts, of course, the coming of a masterpiece by someone not named George Moore. So might the references to Don Quixote not also apply to Ulysses?\n Cervantes' mocking send-up of medieval knightly romances, published in two parts in 1605 and 1615, quickly became the \"national epic\" of Spanish culture, and its author quickly assumed the iconic status that Homer, Dante, and Shakespeare came to occupy in their cultures. The cultures themselves became \"important\" by virtue of having produced towering works of genius. Like Dante's poem, Cervantes' prose work offered a model of language to revere and imitate in a land riven by regional and dialectal differences. Like Shakespeare's plays it defined national identity just as nation-states were defining Europe.\n Don Quixote has one additional claim to fame: it was, in the view of many people, the first modern novel. Adventurous novels like Laurence Sterne's Tristram Shandy and Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn proclaim their debt to it, and countless others could never have existed without its innovations. Mundane, democratic, comical, ironic, skeptical, subjective, perspectival, dialogic: this work saw where epic tales would go in an era when ordinary people were grabbing the spotlight from hereditary elites, prose was displacing verse, and individual perceptions were starting to seem more real than universal teachings. It also pioneered a particular narrative pattern that later novelists would return to again and again. Two male protagonists who are polar opposites in most obvious ways, but whose minds somehow mesh, undertake a series of episodic adventures that highlight both their differences and their similarities. (One example that rivals Cervantes' stories for length and readability are the twenty sea novels of Patrick O'Brian.)\n Gifford suggests that Eglinton's reason for comparing Moore and Martyn to Quixote and Sancho may be primarily physical: \"As Don Quixote is thin so Sancho Panza is fat; George Moore was slender, Martyn heavy-set. The parallel suggests that the earthy Martyn tagged around after the ethereal and imaginative Moore.\" He acknowledges, though, that Martyn \"appears to have been more of a romantic idealist\" than Moore. Neither he nor any other published annotator appears to have considered that Cervantes' mismatched duo may also serve as patterns for Joyce's male leads, who fulfill the archetypes more perfectly. Stephen is half-starved while Bloom carries around a few too many pounds. Stephen's head swims with theological abstractions, literary innovations, dreams of personal vindication, and fantastic transformations of reality. Bloom thinks of realistic desires, get-rich-quick schemes, the price of trousers, and his own shortcomings. But, as Eumaeus observes, \"Though they didn't see eye to eye in everything, a certain analogy there somehow was, as if both their minds were travelling, so to speak, in the one train of thought.\"\n Joyce never again mentions Don Quixote and Sancho Panza in Ulysses, but it is interesting to speculate about ways in which their adventures may inform some of Stephen's and Bloom's. For instance, tapping his forehead in Circe, Stephen declares that \"in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.\" He is then soundly thrashed by a British soldier. His grandiose and fantastic dream of killing his country's oppressors, albeit in a completely peaceful way, contains more than a whiff of Quixote's futile assaults on imaginary knights and monsters, which often end with him lying smashed on the ground. And like Sancho, who is always left to pick up the pieces, Bloom removes Stephen from the scene of his wild fantasies, props him up, and escorts him home. The name that Quixote adopts in Part 1, chapter 19, \"the Knight of the Rueful Countenance,\" may have an oblique relevance to Stephen. Sancho gives him the title because his teeth are so bad that many of them have fallen out, and Stephen is \"Toothless Kinch, the superman.\"\n Or consider Bloom's dream of a country estate in Ithaca. His dogged pragmatism may well owe something to Sancho's, but he has his own dreams, as does Sancho. Quixote convinces the pig farmer to become his squire and accompany him on his knightly quests by promising him that, at some point, he will have his own island to rule. In Chapters 42-46 of Part II a duke and duchess trick Sancho into believing that he has found his ínsula. He happily sets out learning how to rule his subjects, seeks advice from the ducal couple and the knight, and does surprisingly well. Might this episode lurk within Bloom's never-to-be-realized dream of acquiring a luxurious house and grounds and living the life of a country gentleman? Perhaps not, but his fantasy concludes with the thought that he will become a \"resident magistrate or justice of the peace\" and chart a course of government \"between undue clemency and excessive rigour,\" dispensing \"unbiassed homogeneous indisputable justice\" and \"actuated by an innate love of rectitude.\"\n \"And his Dulcinea?\" May a reader hope to find her in Joyce's book? His more quixotic figure, Stephen, has no woman, but throughout the day he dreams of finding one. In Proteushe wonders which real woman his dreams might seize on: \"She, she, she. What she? The virgin at Hodges Figgis’ window on Monday.\" Cervantes' Dulcinea, similarly, is not a real woman: Quixote dreams her up out of a village girl who has a different name, and she never appears in the novel. Sancho, on the other hand, is married to a quite actual woman named Teresa Cascajo, and they have a daughter, María Sancha, who has reached marriageable age just as Milly is doing in Ulysses. It is hard to say whether Joyce may have paid any attention at all to these likenesses.\n The most abiding law of epics is that they recall and reshape other epics, reinterpreting the old tradition for new times and cultures. It seems quite possible that Joyce, like Twain with his tale of Jim and Huck floating down the Mississippi, may have conceived his pair of walkers as an updated version of Cervantes' mounted duo. In their very different ways, both men embody the mock-heroic spirit of the Spanish novel, doggedly seeking poetic meaning in a prosaic world."

    "note": " \"Donnybrook,\" a southeastern district of Dublin, was a sedate suburb in Joyce's time, but it had become a byword for violent brawls from the annual fairs that were held there in earlier centuries, when it was an isolated village.",
    "expandedNote": " The Donnybrook fair was established by royal charter in 1204, during the reign of England's King John. For two weeks from late August to mid-September people gathered in large numbers to buy and sell food, livestock, and other agricultural goods, and by the 19th century there were many carnival amusements, but the fair was also an annual occasion for immoderate drinking, cock-fighting, gambling, loud music, dancing, flirtation, outright fornication, and fighting with fists and shillelaghs. In response to the protests of decent citizens, many attempts were made to abolish the fair in the first half of the 19th century. The Dublin Corporation finally succeeding in shutting it down in 1855, by buying the license from its current owners for £3,000. \n Two quotations in a 2012 blog on the fair by Ciarán on the website comeheretome.com give a sense of the mayhem that occurred annually when hordes of Dubliners tramped the dusty road to Donnybrook. On 31 August 1778, the Freeman’s Journal remarked on the pilgrims returning from this modern Gomorrah: “How irksome it was to friends of the industry and well-being of Society to hear that upwards of 50,000 persons visited the fair on the previous Sunday, and returned to the city like intoxicated savages.” In his 1867 book The English Constitution, Walter Bagehot observed that the first principle of the fair was \"Wherever you see a head, hit it.” \n At the end of Lotus Eaters Leopold Bloom, decent citizen, thinks that the civilized sport of cricket does not fit well with Irish sensibilities: \"Donnybrook fair more in their line.\" He goes on to recall a popular song: \"And the skulls we were acracking when M'Carthy took the floor.\" Anarchic Ireland has its revenge in Circe, when Bloom, on trial for his sins and sexual abnormalities, is assaulted by \"THE IRISH EVICTED TENANTS\": \"(In bodycoats, kneebreeches, with Donnybrook fair shillelaghs.) Sjambok him!\"\n By 1904 Donnybrook had outgrown its scruffy past to become a fairly comfortable middle-class suburb on a par with other southern towns like Rathgar, Rathmines, Terenure, and Sandymount. Its name appears along with other tramline destinations in Aeolus, and Sirens indicates that the car which carries Blazes Boylan to his assignation with Molly is driven by one James Barton of \"number one Harmony avenue, Donnybrook.\" It would appear that the narrative supplies this detail, and repeats it in Circe, because drivers of jaunting cars were required to display a numbered license that listed the driver's name and address.\n The National Library of Ireland Flickr page details some good detective work on the 20th century photograph displayed with this note: \"Our catalogue described this as a Street scene, possibly in Dublin: with motor cars, pedestrians and tramlines. I knew we could do better than that, hoping J. McCaffrey at no. 39 would be a help. I was thinking Terenure-ish, but was absolutely wrong! Thanks a million to DannyM8 who suggested Donnybrook, and then backed it up with hard evidence from the 1911 census, finding John McCaffrey, greengrocer, at 39 Donnybrook Road! With regard to an accurate date for this photo, one of the Irish Times news posters trumpets \"Religious War in Mexico,\" and exactly that headline appeared on page 8 of the Irish Times on Monday, 15 August 1927, so that seems relatively safe for dating. . . . P.S. Love the alleged Confesserie! Did you confess your guilt for guzzling cream cakes here?\""

  "040007dorsetstreet": {
    "note": " \"Dorset street\" is a major thoroughfare in the north part of inner Dublin, running from southwest to northeast. Eccles Street, where the Blooms live, is a short street just inside the North Circular Road whose eastern end marks the junction of Upper and Lower Dorset Streets. The pub owned by \"Larry O'Rourke\" sits on the corner of Dorset and Eccles, while \"Dlugacz's\" shop is on Upper Dorset Street, farther south toward the river. Bloom's food-finding jaunt on Dorset Street in Calypso reappears as a food fight in Circe, and in Sirens the approach of Boylan's carriage to Eccles Street is signaled by the phrase, \"Jingle into Dorset Street.\"",
    "expandedNote": " When Bloom leaves his house in Calypso to buy breakfast, he crosses \"to the bright side,\" i.e. the south side of Eccles being lit by the early morning sun, and then walks southeast a short distance to Dorset. We hear that \"He approached Larry O'Rourke's\" on the corner, gazing into the windows and imagining seeing the pub owner's \"Baldhead over the blind. . . . There he is, sure enough, my bold Larry, leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching the aproned curate swab up with mop and bucket.\" Bloom decides to say good morning and, \"Turning into Dorset street he said freshly in greeting through the doorway\" (visible in the first photograph), \"Good day, Mr O'Rourke.\" \n After an exchange of pleasantries, Bloom reflects on the pub business for two paragraphs. During the meditation we learn that he has \"passed Saint Joseph's National school,\" on Dorset Street Upper, meaning that he has turned right at the corner. The school was on the west side of Dorset, so Bloom has remained in the sunlight. Then we we find him standing in front of the butcher's shop: \"He halted before Dlugacz's window, staring at the hanks of sausages, polonies, black and white.\" This establishment too appears to be on Dorset Street, though Gifford notes that \"The only pork butcher in Dorset Street Upper, where Bloom goes to buy his kidney, was Michael Brunton at 55A.\" (Joyce gave the shop to a fictional owner based on Moses Dlugacz, whom he knew in Trieste.) After going in and buying the kidney, the narrative says that \"He walked back along Dorset street,reading gravely. Agendath Netaim: planters' company.\"\n As he nears Eccles Street on his return trip, \"A bent hag crossed from Cassidy's, clutching a naggin bottle by the neck.\" Cassidy's was on the east side of Dorset Street, directly across from O'Rourke's. Other than a small distance getting from his house to Dorset Street, then, Bloom's entire journey in Calypso takes place on this thoroughfare. Since it is his go-to place for buying food, the fantasy in Circe makes sense: \"Several shopkeepers from upper and lower Dorset street throw objects of little or no commercial value\" at Bloom: \"hambones, condensed milk tins, unsaleable cabbage, stale bread, sheep's tails, odd pieces of fat.\""

  "160005dosshouse": {
    "note": " When Stephen says that he has no place to spend the night, Corley tells him that \"There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street, Mrs Maloney’s, but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables.\" A tanner was 6d., quite cheap for a night's lodging. For 4-6 pence, establishments called doss-houses, or kip-houses, or common lodging-houses, would put people up in crowded, bad-smelling dormitory rooms.",
    "expandedNote": " Gifford notes that Marlborough Street lies just a bit west of where Stephen and Corley are standing, and that the 1904 edition of Thom's does not list a Mrs. Maloney on Marlborough, but does list many \"tenements.\" Since Thom's did not list names in connection with tenements, it is possible that one of these derelict buildings did house a Mrs. Maloney's, but for Joyce's purposes the veracity of the name may not have mattered much in the anonymous sea of Dublin's tenements. That a doss-house, as opposed to a more respectable boarding-house, would have resided in one of these buildings is almost certain.\n On his website dedicated to British workhouses, www.workhouses.org.uk, Peter Higginbotham observes that doss-houses \"were notorious for their overcrowding.\" The daily fee, he notes, \"bought a bed or, in many cases, a share of a bed. Not only was bed-sharing common, but some establishments operated a two-relay system where a bed was occupied by one person during the day, and another by night. In some cases, a three-relay system shared a bed in three eight-hour shifts. / As well as the bed, a doss-house could provide access to a kitchen which also served as a common-room. In smaller lodging houses, the proprietor might even supply breakfast.\" \n Higginbotham quotes at length from author Jack London's vivid account of staying at a large London doss-house. Size, in London's experience, generally meant improved quality: \"The little private doss-houses, as a rule, are unmitigated horrors. I have slept in them, and I know; but let me pass them by and confine myself to the bigger and better ones.\" He observes that even at the larger establishments the nauseating smells, grimly uncongenial society, and complete lack of homelike surroundings made a mockery of the commonly used phrase, \"The poor man's hotel.\" At some, paying an extra penny (say, 5d. instead of 4d.) would entitle one to an individual \"cabin,\" but these were cubicles rather than rooms: spaces barely bigger than a bed with no ceiling, no door, no facilities for storing one's possessions from day to day, and no way of blocking out the snores of all the surrounding sleepers.\n Doss-houses catered mostly to unmarried workers in Dublin's vast proletarian underclass, and were only a small step above the charitable workhouses that offered a place to sleep in return for hard labor or religious self-improvement. Of all the options of places to stay the night that Stephen ponders on June 16—the Martello tower, his aunt Sara's house in Irishtown, Bloom's house—the poor man's hotel on Marlborough Street is by far the grimmest. \n In Cyclops, the unnamed narrator says that Bob Doran's mother-in-law, Mrs. Mooney, \"kept a kip in Hardwicke street.\" A \"kip,\" in Irish parlance, is a dive: a seedy, filthy establishment. The narrator's use of this word for Mrs. Mooney's boarding-house is a slander in keeping with his reference to her \"procuring rooms to street couples.\" In Joyce's story \"The Boarding House,\" Mrs. Mooney caters to a better-off clientele and does not rent beds by the night. Her \"young men paid fifteen shillings a week for board and lodgings (beer or stout at dinner excluded). They shared in common tastes and occupations and for this reason were very chummy with one another.\" Mrs. Mooney is charging more than four times what Mrs. Maloney charges, and she clearly maintains some semblance of welcoming strangers into a middle-class home. The story does mention, however, that the boarding house \"was beginning to get a certain fame,\" suggesting sexual irregularities—so perhaps it has declined by the time represented in Ulysses, and the narrator of Cyclops is not entirely off base."

  "090003hyde": {
    "note": " Douglas Hyde (1860-1949), known also as An Craoibhín Aoibhinn (the Sweet Little Branch or Pleasant Little Branch), was an important scholar of the Irish language who played a major part in the Irish Cultural Revival. His popular Love Songs of Connacht (1893) published Irish poems that he had collected in the West, with verse and prose translations into English. Haines misses Stephen's talk in the library because he has gone to buy a copy of Hyde's book. To add injury to insult, the novel marks Stephen's failure (so far) to distinguish himself as a poet by having him shape sounds—\"mouth to her mouth's kiss\"—that clearly derive from one of Hyde's lyrics.",
    "expandedNote": " In Scylla and Charybdis Mr. Best announces that \"Haines is gone.\" The Englishman had expressed interest in hearing Stephen's talk on Shakespeare, but Best's mentions of Irish mythology and poetry have sent him off in a different direction: \"He's quite enthusiastic, don't you know, about Hyde's Lovesongs of Connacht. I couldn't bring him in to hear the discussion. He's gone to Gill's to buy it.\" John Eglinton comments sardonically on this quest for Irish authenticity: \"The peatsmoke is going to his head.\" But George Russell voices the ambitions of the Revival: \"— People do not know how dangerous lovesongs can be, the auric egg of Russell warned occultly. The movements which work revolutions in the world are born out of the dreams and visions in a peasant's heart on the hillside.\" In Wandering Rocks we encounter Haines sitting at the DBC with \"his newbought book.\" \n The repetitive motif at the heart of Stephen's poetic manipulations of sound in Proteus—\"mouth to her mouth's kiss. . . . Mouth to her kiss. No. Must be two of em. Glue em well. Mouth to her mouth's kiss. / His lips lipped and mouthed fleshless lips of air: mouth to her womb. Oomb, allwombing tomb\"—comes from the last stanza of \"My Grief on the Sea,\" a poem in Hyde's Love Songs:\n And my love came behind me—\n He came from the South;\n His breast to my bosom,\n His mouth to my mouth.\n Stephen has ambitions to transform the simple verses into something grandiose and gothic—\"He comes, pale vampire, through storm his eyes, his bat sails bloodying the sea, mouth to her mouth's kiss\"—but he has not yet achieved even that dubious transformation of a minor lyric. \n Cyclops has fun with the kind of literary recovery projects that Hyde undertook, paying serious scholarly attention to the canine verse of Garryowen: \"Our greatest living phonetic expert (wild horses shall not drag it from us!) has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has found it bears a striking resemblance (the italics are ours) to the ranns of ancient Celtic bards. We are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised the bookloving world but rather (as a contributor D. O. C. points out in an interesting communication published by an evening contemporary) of the harsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye.\"\n Hyde grew up in the west, in Sligo and Roscommon, and learned Irish from the quarter of the population who still spoke it in the countryside in those counties. Passionately dedicated to preventing the extinction of the native language and culture, he contributed to Yeats’s Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry (1888), published his own Besides the Fire: A Collection of Irish Gaelic Folk Stories in 1890, and, after the Love Songs in 1893, also published Religious Songs of Connacht in 1906, as well as scholarly works likeThe Story of Early Gaelic Literature (1895) and the Literary History of Ireland (1899). He collaborated with Yeats and others in the work of the Literary Theatre, which became the Abbey Theatre, and he exerted immense cultural influence through the Gaelic League until that group was infiltrated bySinn Féin and became an essentially political organization. In 1938 he became the first President of the new Irish republic.\n Scylla and Charybdis reproduces nearly verbatim one of Hyde's quatrains:\n Bound thee forth my Booklet quick.\n To greet the Polished Public.\n Writ—I ween't was not my Wish—\n In lean unLovely English.\n The six-stanza poem that begins with these lines concludes Hyde's The Story of Early Gaelic Literature. That Stephen knows part of it by heart (characteristically, he makes the Public \"callous\") suggests that he has some considerable regard for Hyde's writings."

  "140038drhorne": {
    "note": " At the time represented in the novel Dr. Andrew John Horne was one of two Masters, or physician directors, of the National Maternity Hospital in Holles Street. Horne served as Master of the hospital for nearly 30 years, from 1894 until his death in 1924. Joyce goes out of his way to suggest the capable and charitable offices of the good doctor, but it seems that his warm feeling was not reciprocated.",
    "expandedNote": " In Lestrygonians Josie Breen tells Bloom that Mina Purefoy is in the hospital because \"Dr Horne got her in,\" consistent with the mission of Dublin's maternity hospitals to help all women in need. Oxen mentions his proprietorship: \"Of that house A. Horne is lord. Seventy beds keeps he there.\" Later, the chapter very exactly identifies \"the National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles street, of which, as is well known, Dr A. Horne (Lic. in Midw., F. K. Q. C. P. I.) is the able and popular master.\" The anagrammatic titles, which Joyce has such fun with in Aeolus and Cyclops, here seem more respectful, signifying that Horne was Licensed in Midwifery and was Former Knight of the Queen's College of Physicians in Ireland. \n Andrew Horne was born in County Galway in 1856, attended Clongowes Wood College for five years, studied medicine at the Carmichael School of Medicine in Dublin, was licensed by the Royal College of Surgeons in 1877, specialized in obstetrics while working at St. Vincent's and the Mater hospitals, became the assistant Master at the Rotunda Hospital on Rutland (now Parnell) Square, moved to the new NMH in Holles Street as Joint Master in 1894, and later was appointed sole Master. He became a member of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland in 1881, served as its Vice President from 1894 to 1896 and as President from 1908 to 1910, and was knighted by King Edward in 1913. (The RCPI acquired its present title in 1890. Before that, it was known as the King and Queen's College of Physicians in Ireland, as the initials in Oxen indicate.) \n Fully 17 times, Oxen of the Sun links the name of this accomplished obstetrician with the hospital in which he served, turning a national institution into a personal domain: \"Horne's house,\" \"Horne's Hall,\" \"the house of Horne,\" \"the high hall of Horne's house,\" \"Horne's.\" It appears, however, that the admiration that Joyce felt for Doctor Horne did not run in the reverse direction. According to a 14 June 2013 post by Harriet Wheelock on the RCPI Heritage Centre Blog site, Horne never had a copy of Ulyssesin his house, and Horne's family recalls that he \"turned Joyce out of the Maternity Hospital in 1904, when Joyce was a student, for an offensive remark about 'the poor breeding like rabbits.'\" The truth of the remark, Wheelock notes, has not been authenticated."

  "030018dringdring": {
    "note": " \"Dringdring!\" sounds three times in one paragraph of Proteus as Stephen imagines priests in various churches and chapels performing their sacred rites: \"elevating\" the consecrated Host (the priest lifts the wafer toward the heavens and then kneels before the altar), \"locking it into a pyx\" (a pyx is any receptacle holding the consecrated bread), and \"taking housel all to his own cheek\" (housel is the act of either giving or receiving the Host, so the priest is ingesting the sacred bread). At each of these moments Stephen hears the sound of the small \"sacring bell\" or \"sanctus bell\" that marks important moments in Catholic church ritual.",
    "expandedNote": " At the elevation of the Host, the sacring bell signals the transubstantiation of the bread of the wafer into the body of Christ. In Stephen's imagination, the fact that bells could be sounding in multiple places at the same time suggests how the medieval theologian William of Occam might have conceived his theory of a single body of Christ incarnated simultaneously in different pieces of bread.\n The argument proceeds by analogy with the pairing of musical notes or spoken vowels: \"Bringing his host down and kneeling he heard twine with his second bell the first bell in the transept (he is lifting his) and, rising, heard (now I am lifting) their two bells (he is kneeling) twang in diphthong.\" In other words, bells sound in different parts of a church as celebrants lift their wafers up toward God and kneel before their separate altars, and by their simultaneity the ringing sounds \"twine\" with one another in the air, or \"twang in diphthong.\" In an analogous way, the distinct wafers both participate in something that is greater than either: the transcendent body of Christ. \n The \"sound of the sacring bell\" appears also in Cyclops, to introduce an absurdly huge procession of churchmen and churchwomen."

  "010018druids": {
    "note": " The \"druids,\" powerfully influential priests in pre-Christian Ireland, are mentioned fairly often in Ulysses. They resonate in popular imagination millennia after their decline, but since they left no written records little can be said with certainty about them.",
    "expandedNote": " In Irish literature from early Christian times, like the Táin Bó Cúailnge, the druids (draoithe) are sorcerers who cast spells and curses, foresee the future through augury, and conduct magical healing rituals. But these accounts written by Christian monks reflect the constriction of the druids' role, and the lessening of their social status, that resulted from the coming of Christianity in the 5th century, an epochal change referenced in Ithaca when Stephen and Bloom discuss Saint Patrick's \"conversion of the Irish nation to christianity from druidism.\" (The conversion almost certainly occurred over the course of many centuries, not all at once in the 5th century as popular mythology has it.)\n In pre-Christian Celtic societies the druids occupied a more important place. Highly honored and highly learned, they apparently acted as priests, lawyers, judges, doctors, historians, philosophers, keepers of poetic tradition, and advisors to kings. According to Pliny and other ancient Greek and Roman historians, they performed their rituals in sacred oak groves, and details from Irish, British, and Scottish oral traditions support this view. Several ancient writers reported that the druids practiced human sacrifice, a view which may inform Bloom's thoughts in Lestrygonians of \"druids' altars\" in connection with various kinds of blood sacrifice (Christian ones not excluded). Gifford notes that \"Early Christian polemicists had accused the druids of human sacrifice in order to discredit them, but Irish historians of the early twentieth century argued that such sacrifices, if they had ever been the practice among Irish druids, had been sublimated to animal sacrifice well before the beginning of the Christian era in Ireland\" (157).\n Buck Mulligan introduces druidism into the novel in Telemachuswith his flip remark that \"We'll have a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids\"—a comment that seems to have nothing to do with any known druidical practice. In Oxen of the Sun Mulligan renews his mockery of the Yeats sisters' Dundrum press by calling it the \"Druiddrum press,\" lumping druids together with Formorian fishgods and weird sisters. \n This broad mockery of ancient figures may also be at work inCirce when Mananaun MacLir, an Irish and Manx sea god who in this instance looks a lot like George Russell (AE), appears and \"A cold seawind blows from his druid mouth.\"Here, though, there is some textual basis for the connection since Russell's playDeirdre features the druid priest Cathvah, a part that Russell himself performed on stage. In the play, Cathvah calls on Mananaun to destroy the Red Branch knights with his waves. \n The novel occasionally displays interest in whatever spiritual practices may have been in vogue before Saint Patrick. In another part of Oxen, Mulligan notices Bloom staring at a bottle of Bass Ale, lost in thought: \"Malachi saw it and withheld his act, pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label. Warily, Malachi whispered, preserve a druid silence. His soul is far away. It is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be born. Any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the incorruptible eon of the gods.\" Several ancient writers, including Julius Caesar and the Greek historians Alexander of Miletus and Diodorus of Sicily, noted that the druids believed strongly in reincarnation or metempsychosis, in forms perhaps influenced by Pythagorean teachings. This belief in the soul's immortality, its cosmic wandering, and its many births seems to have something to do with Mulligan's sentences.\n Scylla and Charybdis concludes with Stephen thinking, \"Cease to strive. Peace of the druid priests of Cymbeline, hierophantic: from wide earth an altar.\" He recalls lines from the final speech of Shakespeare's play: \n Laud we the gods,\n And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils\n From our blest altars.\n The speaker here is the ancient British king Cymbeline, a Celt, and he is referring to some kind of blood sacrifice (probably of animals) that will take place in a pagan \"temple\" (5.4.398). But the play never mentions \"druid priests.\" Commentators usually connect Stephen's \"peace\" with the message of peace between Britons and Romans (as well as other characters in the romance) discerned by the soothsayer Philharmonus, who works for the Roman general Caius Lucius. The final scene does envision universal peace and connect it with pagan gods—\"The fingers of the pow'rs above,\" in the soothsayer's words (466), or \"The benediction of these covering heavens\" as Belisarius puts it (350)—but the connection specifically with druidism is Stephen's inference.\n His \"Cease to strive. Peace of the druid priests\" is puzzling. Is he meditating appreciatively on the feeling of \"hierophantic\" blessing conveyed in Shakespeare's scene, or fatalistically on the example of a Celt submitting to imperial authority? (Although Shakespeare's Britons have prevailed in battle, Cymbeline promises to resume paying tribute to Caesar.) Taking the latter view, David Weir argues in Ulysses Explained (Palgrave, 2015) that Stephen's \"Cease to strive\" expresses dejection, \"since he has just been rejected by the high priests of Irish culture, among whom AE is chief.\""

  "080013dublincastle": {
    "note": " \"Dublin Castle,\" usually referred to in the novel simply as \"the castle,\" lies off Dame Street, just south of the Liffey in the very center of Dublin. This medieval fortress, reconstructed in the Georgian era as a palace complex, served for many centuries as the seat of British government power in Ireland.",
    "expandedNote": " The Record Tower that dominates the front of the complex was built in the 1220s during the reign of King John as part of a typical Norman defensive fortification: a rectangular courtyard surrounded by four high curtain walls with a circular tower at each corner. The fort was sited where the Poddle river flows into the Liffey at the Black Pool or Dubh Linn that gave Dublin its name, and it was constructed in such a way that the Poddle flowed around three sides, making a natural moat. In the century and a half after disastrous fires in 1673 and 1684, the remaining medieval structures were replaced, the Poddle was diverted underground, and the Castle became more palace than fortress.\n King John was the first Lord of Ireland. The Castle served continuously as the seat of his and later English and British governments until independence in 1922. (When the complex was handed over to Michael Collins in that year, the British representative is said to have pointed out to Collins that he was seven minutes late. Collins is said to have pointed out that the Irish had waited seven hundred years, so seven minutes more would not make much difference.) At the time represented in Ulysses, the Castle was the official town residence of the Lord Lieutenant or Viceroy, the King's representative in Ireland. Many administrative offices were also housed in the complex, including legal and treasury offices and those of the Royal Irish Constabulary and the Dublin Metropolitan Police. \n People who know people in the Castle are by definition \"well connected,\" as Bloom thinks of Mrs. Purefoy's husband in Lestrygonians: \"Theodore’s cousin in Dublin Castle. One tony relative in every family.\" In Oxen of the Sun a Dickensian narrative voice confides to the reader that the Purefoys' newly born son will be named after this important member of the family: \"Young hopeful will be christened Mortimer Edward after the influential third cousin of Mr Purefoy in the Treasury Remembrancer’s office, Dublin Castle.\"\n The phrase \"well connected\" would apply all the more to Martin Cunningham, who works as Chief Clerk in the Crown Solicitor's Office in the Castle. In Wandering Rocks he is saluted by a police guard while leaving the central courtyard on a mission to help Paddy Dignam's family: \n — The youngster will be all right, Martin Cunningham said, as they passed out of the Castleyard gate.\n The policeman touched his forehead.\n — God bless you, Martin Cunningham said, cheerily.\n He signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on towards Lord Edward street.\n The jaunting car that Cunningham hails outside the gate appears to be one attached specifically to the Castle for the use of important bureaucrats. In any case, it becomes known, here and in Cyclops, as \"the castle car.\" \n By virtue of housing the vice-regential executive authority, the state prosecutor's office, and both the municipal and the imperial police forces, the Castle inevitably was the nerve-center for the robust domestic espionage apparatus by which the government sniffed out subversion and sedition. In LestrygoniansBloom imagines the workings of this pervasive network of paid spies and informers: \"Never know who you're talking to. Corny Kelleher he has Harvey Duff in his eye. Like that Peter or Denis or James Carey that blew the gaff on the invincibles. Member of the corporation too. Egging raw youths on to get in the know all the time drawing secret service pay from the castle. Drop him like a hot potato. Why those plainclothes men are always courting slaveys. Easily twig a man used to uniform. Squarepushing up against a backdoor. Maul her a bit. Then the next thing on the menu. And who is the gentleman does be visiting there? Was the young master saying anything?\"\n In Cyclops Martin Cunningham suggests that some state surveillance has been conducted on Bloom: \"He’s a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in Hungary and it was he drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system. We know that in the castle.\" In Circe an ominous spy-like figure announces further suspicions:\n (A dark mercurialised face appears, leading a veiled figure.)\n THE DARK MERCURY: The Castle is looking for him. He was drummed out of the army.\n At the end of Wandering Rocks the Viceroy's carriage rolls along the quays on the north side of the Liffey, receiving salutations from many of the king's subjects. One greeting from the south side of the river is distinctly unpleasant: \"From its sluice in Wood quay wall under Tom Devan's office Poddle river hung out in fealty a tongue of liquid sewage.\" The Poddle, routed underneath Dublin Castle to an opening in the river wall, not only manages to stick out its tongue at the Lord Lieutenant, but does so with the contents of all the toilets in the complex."

  "060033corporation": {
    "note": " From Hades onward, the novel makes seemingly countless references to \"the corporation\" and its members. Dublin Corporation was the name applied collectively to a strong-council (i.e., weak-mayor) city government composed of three kinds of elected officials: \"councillor,\" \"alderman,\" and \"lord mayor.\" These officials, their committees, and many of the bureaus that administered their policies were housed in City Hall, a striking 18th century building which stands just off Dame Street in the heart of central Dublin, near Dublin Castle.",
    "expandedNote": " In 1229, following common English practice, the Anglo-Norman rulers of Dublin established a bicameral representative body called the Corporation for governing the city. The lower house, the \"sheriffs and commons,\" contained seats for 96 representatives of tradesmen's craft guilds and 48 seats for \"sheriff's peers.\" The upper house seated 24 \"aldermen,\" from the Old English ealdorman (elder man), a title which had been used in England for nobles who presided over shires. The aldermen elected a mayor from their ranks, making him answerable to them rather than to the populace at large. \n In 1665, during the Restoration reign of King Charles II, the mayor was made into a more glorified \"Lord Mayor,\" but his role remained limited largely to presiding over meetings and representing the Corporation on ceremonial occasions. Circecaptures the splendor of the modern mayor's regalia in the person of \"Timothy Harrington, late thrice Lord Mayor of Dublin, imposing in mayoral scarlet, gold chain and white silk tie.\" The 22-carat \"golden chain,\" mentioned also in Wandering Rocks, was given to the city of Dublin by King William III in 1698 and is worn on many ceremonial occasions (though rumor has it that the one publicly worn these days is often a fake, to guard against theft). In Nausicaa Cissey Caffrey makes a children's game of the \"gingerbread carriage\" that since the 1750s has carried the mayor to particularly showy events. But the splendid shows mask a shortage of real power in the office. \n The cartoon accompanying this note captures the boredom that must often accompany the fancy displays. It depicts the man who, as Circe notes, was serving in the office on 16 June 1904, \"the Right Honourable Joseph Hutchinson, lord mayor of Dublin.\" In Wandering Rocks James Henry, the assistant town clerk, complains about Hutchinson being out of the country at Llandudno, in Wales, and the city council being in disarray: \"Where was the marshal, he wanted to know, to keep order in the council chamber. And old Barlow the macebearer laid up with asthma, no mace on the table, nothing in order, no quorum even, and Hutchinson, the lord mayor, in Llandudno and little Lorcan Sherlock doing locum tenens for him.\" Lorcan Sherlock was Secretary to the Corporation—\"in effect, deputy lord mayor,\" Gifford notes, and thus locum tenens, holding Hutchinson's place. He became Lord Mayor in 1912.\n Timothy Harrington, mentioned above, was another actual Dublin mayor. He served three one-year terms in the years before Hutchinson. The novel mentions at least four other mayors from the two decades before and after 1904. In Lestrygonians, Wandering Rocks, Nausicaa, and Penelope, \"Val Dillon\" comes up in memories of an 1894 fundraising dinner. Ithaca notices \"Dan Tallon,\" who closed out the 19th century, and \"Thomas Pile,\" who ushered in the 20th. Aeolus and Cyclops observe that \"Nannetti\" is running to become the next mayor. The list is remarkably close to comprehensive: \n Valentine Blake Dillon (1894-95)\n Daniel Tallon (1898-99, 1899-1900)\n Thomas Devereux Pile (1900-01)\n Timothy Harrington (1901-2, 1902-3, 1903-4)\n Joseph Hutchinson (1904-5, 1905-6)\n Joseph Patrick Nannetti (1906-7, 1907-8)\n Lorcan Sherlock (1912-13, 1913-14, 1914-15)\n To these historical personages the novel adds one purely fantastical mayor, Bloom himself. In Circe he becomes \"Leopold! Lord mayor of Dublin!\" Wearing an \"alderman's gown and chain,\" he pushes the pet idea that he had voiced in Hades, that the Corporation should run a tramline from the parkgate to the quays. By including this fantasy, Joyce was perhaps responding to the common saying that Dublin would never have a Jewish Lord Mayor (personal communication from Vincent Altman O'Connor). This tidbit of urban mythology started when a Jew named Lewis Wormser Harris was elected mayor in 1877 and died one day before he was to assume office. The canard was proved false when Robert Briscoe became Lord Mayor in 1956.\n In 1840 the old bicameral structure of commoners and aldermen had been altered by a piece of parliamentary legislation called the Municipal Corporations Act (Ireland). The Dublin Corporation became something more nearly like a modern, unicameral city council, but the distinction between two types of representatives was retained. The name Dublin City Council was applied collectively to mere \"councillors,\" while higher-ranking \"aldermen\" continued to hold privileged positions of administrative and judicial authority. It was not until 2002 that the hierarchical title of alderman was abolished and the name Dublin City Council was applied to the entire representative structure, closing the final chapter of the antiquated Corporation. It remains to be seen if Dublin will ever create a more powerful mayoral office.\n The two kinds of representatives appear in Wandering Rocks: \"On the steps of the City hall Councillor Nannetti, descending, hailed Alderman Cowley and Councillor Abraham Lyon ascending.\" Gifford and Slote note that Abraham Lyon was an actual councillor, but that there is no record of an alderman named Cowley. Nannetti plays a fairly significant role in the novel. He was a master printer who ascended to the mayoralty from the Council, reflecting the modern dissolution of the old hierarchy of tradesmen and nobles. Alderman Robert O'Reilly, mentioned in Lestrygonians, was a man of less stature. Gifford identifies him as \"A merchant tailor by trade\" (another indication of the vanished distinction between tradesmen and aldermen), and \"a small-time Dublin politician, listed as an alderman on the markets committee in the 1890s.\" Bloom has unflattering memories of O'Reilly at the 1894 fundraising dinner, \"emptying the port into his soup before the flag fell. Bobbob lapping it for the inner alderman. Couldn't hear what the band played.\" \n A significant number of Corporation members served simultaneously as Members of Parliament in Westminster. That was the case with Harrington and Nannetti and also with John Hooper, an alderman who figures in Hades and Ithaca when Bloom thinks of \"the wedding present alderman Hooper gave us,\" a stuffed owl. All three of these men supported the nationalist agenda of Parnell's Irish Parliamentary Party. It may seem odd that politicians who had attained the stature and influence of MPs would bother themselves with the humdrum work of a mere city council, but the body carried symbolic as well as practical importance. After the abolition of the Irish Parliament by the Act of Union in 1800, the Dublin Corporation was the largest elected body in Ireland and perhaps the only one that could embody hopes of national independence. Daniel O'Connell attached such importance to it that, after his long struggle to become a Member of Parliament (first elected in 1828, he finally was seated in 1830), he ran for election to the Corporation in the 1830s. In 1841 he became the first Catholic Lord Mayor since the reign of James II.\n The \"city hall\" mentioned twice in the novel is a stately neoclassical building from the 1770s. Designed by architect Thomas Cooley and constructed of England's Portland limestone, it was originally built to house the Royal Exchange, a place where Dublin businessmen, and also merchants from overseas, could meet and trade. The Corporation purchased it and renamed it City Hall in 1852. The name and function remain today.\n Joyce's interest in the city government of Dublin continued into Finnegans Wake. Thanks to the work of Roland McHugh it can be seen that the section in which HCE takes the stand to defend himself (532-54), often called the \"Haveth Childers Everywhere\" episode, alludes to at least 72 different Lord Mayors of Dublin, as well as to the original Mayor, Thomas Cusack—joining with other clusters of allusions to rival the hundreds of the world's rivers evoked in the Anna Livia Plurabelle chapter. Elsewhere, the book plays not only with the figure of the Lord Mayor (307, 568) and his chain of office (494, 568), but with the three castles featured in the city's coat of arms (seen in two of the images accompanying this note), and with its official motto: Obedientia civium urbis felicitas, \"The happiness of the city consists in the obedience of its citizens\" (23, 76). \n There are probably many other such allusions in the Wake. In an article titled \"Some Irish and Anglo-Irish Allusions inFinnegans Wake,\" JJQ 11.3 (1974): 266-78, John Garvin notes that \"'Up Murphy, Henson, and O'Dwyer, the Warchester Warders!' (FW 446) refers to Murphy, Hernon, and O'Dwyer, the Dublin City Commissioners who administered the affairs of the Dublin Corporation, 1924-30, while the members of the City Council were removed from office\" (277)."

  "010064dundrum": {
    "note": " Having mocked Catholicism and the Revival of “our Irish poets” earlier in Telemachus, Mulligan turns his wit to demeaning the cultivation of Irish “folk” identity: ancient legends, myths, customs, and spiritual beliefs that were being studied and imitated by scholars and writers from the 1880s onward. One particular target of his sarcasm is the greatest of the writers of the Revival, William Butler Yeats, whose Fergus song he has just been quoting from.",
    "expandedNote": " Thornton notes that \"five lines of text and ten pages of notes\" seems to refer to \"the work of the antiquarians who were editing, explaining, and annotating early Irish literature and folklore at this time\"; Gifford says of the overall movement, “At times this interest ran to hairsplitting scholarship and at times to gross sentimentality.” For Haines' benefit, Mulligan adopts the persona of a hairsplitting pedant, and proceeds to demean the seriousness of the scholarly enterprise by citing all sorts of inauthentic arcane beliefs. \n A central figure in his mockery is Yeats, who joined the ranks of the scholars when he edited a collection titled Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry in 1888. Yeats' poems in the 1880s and 1890s show how extensively and beautifully these myths could shape a vision of Irish life, and at the same time how readily they could encourage escapism, freefloating sentiment, and vague substitutes for thought. \n “The fishgods of Dundrum” ridicules Yeats' obsession. Gifford notes that fish gods “are associated with the Formorians, gloomy giants of the sea, one of the legendary peoples of prehistoric Ireland.” But Dundrum makes no sense in connection with them. One Dundrum, north of Dublin, was the place “where ancient Irish tribes held a folk version of Olympic games.” Another, south of Dublin, was both the site of an insane asylum, and the village where Yeats’ sister Elizabeth established the Dun Emer press in 1903 to publish his “new works and works by other living Irish authors in limited editions on handmade paper.” Her sister Lily became involved with the Dun Emer Guild, “which produced handwoven embroideries and tapestries.” \n So a piece of authentic mythology (fishgods) is mixed up with some unrelated ancient customs, and both are attached to the Yeats family enterprise of reviving Irish art, with the implication that all these cultural enterprises, and all three Yeats siblings, belong in a lunatic asylum. At the end ofOxen of the Sun, Mulligan can be heard continuing to mock the Yeats sisters' publishing enterprise, now as the \"Druiddrum press\": \"To be printed and bound at the Druiddrum press by two designing females. Calf covers of pissedon green. Last word in art shades.\"\n “Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind” establishes another chain of bizarre and wildly funny associations. The “weird sisters” have nothing to do with Irish mythology; they appear in Shakespeare’s Macbeth as Scottish witches whose name may owe something to the Old English concept of wyrd or fate. But we have just had a glancing allusion to two sisters involved in the publishing business, so now it would seem that Yeats’ sisters are a bit “weird.” \n And indeed these sisters have used the phrase \"the big wind.\" The Dun Emer edition of Yeats’ In the Seven Woods announces that the book was completed “the sixteenth day of July in the year of the big wind, 1903.” This phrase usually refers to 1839, which saw a terrible windstorm that destroyed hundreds of houses. Apparently there was another formidable tempest in 1903; but there is nothing ancient or mythological about it. Oxen of the Sun refers to this recent tempest: \"the big wind of last February a year that did havoc the land so pitifully.\"\n In his final sally, Mulligan gives up slandering Yeats and his family, and riffing on mythology; now he directs his attention to mocking the more pedantic scholars. Turning to Stephen, his professorial colleague in crime, and imitating academic affectation “in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his brows,” he asks for assistance with a bibliographic citation: \"is mother Grogan's tea and water pot spoken of in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads?\" \n The question is as absurd as Shakespeare’s Feste asking, “For what says Quinapalus?” Mother Grogan is a character in a silly contemporary Irish song rather than a figure of ancient folklore. The medieval Mabinogion contains many ancient Celtic legends, but it is Welsh rather than Irish. And the Upanishads are ancient Vedic texts of Hindu spirituality and philosophy—of great interest to Theosophists, but otherwise completely unconnected to Ireland. Stephen, “gravely” participating in the scholarly charade, ends the mockery with his own very funny reply to Mulligan’s question.\n The humor may be aimed at more than just Irish revivalists, however. On ulyssesseen.com, Andrew Levitas argues that Mulligan invokes this song \"to skewer Haines’ attitude toward Ireland and things Irish. Haines is collecting 'exotic' Irish sayings and other folk esoterica, in the same way Bartok, Dvorak and Smetana collected ethnic folk tunes from the backwaters of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, as modernity began to overtake these regions.\" Since Wales is \"another Celtic nation incorporated into Great Britain,\" and India is \"Britain’s leading colony,\" Mulligan may be mocking the Englishman's project of cultural appropriation."

    "note": " \"Dunphy's\" is a pub once owned by Thomas Dunphy, also referred to as \"Dunphy's corner\" because it sits at the intersection of the North Circular Road and the Phibsborough Road. Turning north toward the Royal Canal, the procession hangs a right onto Phibsborough at this corner, prompting reminiscence of the time a hearse overturned making the turn and spilled its contents onto the pavement.",
    "expandedNote": " In addition to the gruesome thoughts elicited by this memory, Simon Dedalus thinks of car races navigating urban corners: \"First round Dunphy's, Mr Dedalus said, nodding.

Tiptop position for a pub. Expect we'll pull up here on the way back to drink his health. Pass round the consolation. Elixir of life.\"\n According to Thom's, in 1904 the pub was owned by John Doyle. In 1907 Doyle rebuilt the establishment and named it after himself. It remains \"Doyle's\" or \"Doyle's Corner\" to this day."

  "170005dustbuckets": {
    "note": " Gifford glosses the \"exposed corporation emergency dustbuckets\" that Bloom apparently is mentioning to Stephen at the beginning of Ithaca as \"Outdoor trash baskets to be provided by the Dublin Corporation. This is one of Bloom's 'civic self-help' ideas; the baskets did not exist in 1904.\" But the strange use of the word buckets may show Bloom subconsciously hearkening back to some shameful hallucinations in Circe.",
    "expandedNote": " If Gifford is correct about the trash baskets, it absolves Bloom of one venial civic sin: throwing away the paper \"throwaway\" in the River Liffey, in Lestrygonians. Littering can hardly be condemned when a city provides no receptacles for its citizens to dispose of their trash. (And indeed the urban Liffey was a sea of floating trash at this time.)\n But the word \"dustbuckets\" does not seem quite right for a trash basket. Buckets usually hold liquids, and that is true of nearly all the two dozen or so times that buckets are mentioned in Ulysses: they hold holy water, wet sand, beer, cleaning fluids, plaster, internal organs of butchered animals, mutton broth, street muck. The word dustbin was commonly used of household trash cans in the 19th century, and public trash cans in Dublin today are called rubbish bins, so why does Bloom think of buckets rather than bins?\n Calling them \"emergency dustbuckets\" is even stranger, since throwing solid waste in trash cans is seldom an emergency. It seems possible that Joyce, in this chapter of Latinate words, is playing on the etymological root meaning of the word. Latin mergere means to immerse, to plunge into liquid, which confirms the impression that buckets should hold liquids.\n Buckets do indeed perform emergency functions of receiving liquid in the book. In Circe a woman, feet spread wide apart, \"pisses cowily\" in the street, prompting a hallucination in which a \"Gaffer\" tells a story of a workman named Cairns who comes down from a scaffold in Beaver Street and \"what was he after doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on the shavings for Derwan's plasterers.\" Those listening to the story laugh loudly, which makes Bloom defensive (even though he is not Cairns): \"Coincidence too. They think it funny. Anything but that. Broad daylight. Trying to walk. Lucky no woman.\" \n Slightly later in the same chapter, Bloom is questioned in court about a still greater impropriety involving a bucket: \"The crossexamination proceeds re Bloom and the bucket. A large bucket. Bloom himself. Bowel trouble. In Beaver street. Gripe, yes. Quite bad. A plasterer's bucket. By walking stifflegged. Suffered untold misery. Deadly agony. About noon. Love or burgundy. Yes, some spinach. Crucial moment. He did not look in the bucket. Nobody. Rather a mess.\" Still later in Circe, King Edward VII appears holding \"a plasterer's bucket on which is printed Défense d'uriner\" (Urinating Prohibited).\n When Bloom thinks of dustbins, he may be subconsciously recalling the \"emergency\" functions that an \"exposed\" bucket might serve."

  "170004duumvirate": {
    "note": " As the etymologically exact use of the word \"circus\" and the strangely technical-sounding \"subtends\" may already have suggested, Ithaca will draw heavily on English words derived from Latin, and, to a lesser extent, Greek. These ancient languages are the beloved province of theology (hence appropriate to a catechism), and of mathematics, biology, astronomy, medicine, law, and other scientific or quasi-scientific disciplines that seek unambiguous exactitude when analyzing the messy materials of life.",
    "expandedNote": " A \"duumvirate\" is a rule of two men (Latin vir = man). In ancient Rome duumviri were magistrates or other municipal officers who held office jointly. There is an obvious relevance here to the union of Odysseus and Telemachus, king and prince of Ithaca, walking toward the palace where they will restore proper rule to the island. The word also clearly relates to the fact that, as they walk, Stephen and Bloom \"deliberate\" on various topics, expressing their concurring or differing opinions on subjects as various as \"Music, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman, prostitution, diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and glowlamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees, exposed corporation emergency dustbuckets, the Roman catholic church, ecclesiastical celibacy, the Irish nation, jesuit education, careers, the study of medicine, the past day, the maleficent influence of the presabbath, Stephen's collapse.\" Deliberation derives from Latin librare = to weigh, and our two intellectual adult males are weighing matters, as magistrates should. \n An \"itinerary\" is the route or proposed route of a journey (Latin iter = journey). The OED defines \"paraheliotropic\" (not found in many dictionaries) thus: \"Of leaves: Turning their edges in the direction of incident light\" (Greek para = aside + helios = sun + tropos = turning). The more common, but still foreign, word \"ecclesiastical\" means having to do with the institution of the church (Greek ekklesia = an assembly of citizens). A \"maleficent\" influence is an evil or harmful one (Latin malus = bad + facere = to do).\n And so on. The reader of Ithaca who does not possess a solid grounding in ancient Latin and Greek will do well to keep a good dictionary nearby."

  "050033eccehomo": {
    "note": " In Lotus Eaters, a chapter in which Bloom yearns for palliatives to relieve his sexual anguish, he finds a lazily reclining Buddha more appealing than the Christian god of bloody tortures: \"Not like Ecce Homo. Crown of thorns and cross.\" The story of Christ's thorns and cross, told in the biblical gospels, was represented in a trilogy of paintings by a late 19th century Hungarian artist, one of which, Ecce Homo, was displayed in Dublin and inspired Joyce to write an admiring essay. Several paragraphs later in Lotus Eaters, thoughts of Christ on the cross return when Bloom thinks of the Catholic acronyms \"I.N.R.I.\" and \"I.H.S.\"",
    "expandedNote": " Matthew's gospel records that, after Pontius Pilate assented to the Jews' demand that Jesus be crucified, the Roman soldiers mocked and tormented the purported Messiah by putting a crown of thorns on him: \"And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews. And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head\" (Matthew 27:29). The sharp thorns pressed into Christ's scalp anticipate the nails driven into his hands and feet on Golgotha, and the two tortures have become iconographically combined in the common Christian image of a cross wreathed with a crown of thorns.\n In John's gospel, the mock crowning occurs after Pilate examines Jesus but before he gives the crowd of angry Jews what they want. \"Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that you may know that I find no fault in him. Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man! When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him\" (19:4-6). \"Behold the man\" in the King James English corresponds to a Latin phrase in the Vulgate Bible, \"Ecce homo.\" \n Late in his prolific career Mihály Munkácsy, a Hungarian artist who died in 1900, painted a trilogy of immense canvases (each more than 20 feet, or 6 meters, long) titled Christ in Front of Pilate (1881), Golgotha (1884), andEcce Homo (1896). The paintings quickly became famous and went on tour in Europe and America. In 1899 Ecce Homowas displayed at the Royal Hibernian Academy in Abbey Street Lower, where a 17-year-old Joyce was moved to write an essay about it.\n Anticipating his lecture on \"Drama and Life\" in the following year, the young Joyce saw Munkácsy's painting as a powerful \"drama,\" by which he meant a work in any artistic medium that conveys eternal human passions and aspirations. His analysis focused on the states of mind visible in the dozens of faces and postures represented in the painting, seeing it as \"a frightfully real presentment of all the baser passions of humanity, in both sexes, in every gradation, raised and lashed into a demoniac carnival\" (Critical Writings, 35). Even when painting Jesus and Mary, Joyce argued, Munkácsy eschewed traditional static depictions of holiness to give piercing renditions of ordinary, suffering humanity.\n Ecce Homo includes some of the details mentioned in Matthew 27 and John 19, including the reed in Jesus' hands. Golgotha, like many other paintings of the Crucifixion, includes the letters INRI at the top of Jesus' cross. Bloom thinks of these as he looks at the priest putting away the communion cup after mass: \"Letters on his back: I.N.R.I? No: I.H.S. Molly told me one time I asked her. I have sinned: or no: I have suffered, it is. And the other one? Iron nails ran in.\"\n The acronym he is looking for is another traditional detail of Christ's passion, said to have been placed at the top of his cross by the Roman soldiers, which repeats the mockery of the crown: Iesus Nazarenus, Rex Iudaeorum (Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews). Bloom recaptures the spirit of mockery with a joking alternative that he has heard somewhere: Iron Nails Ran In. In Lestrygonians he is still thinking of how appallingly bloody Christian objects of devotion are, and the phrase recurs: \"Our Saviour. Wake up in the dead of night and see him on the wall, hanging. Pepper’s ghost idea. Iron Nails Ran In.\" \n But the letters on the priest's surplice are actually IHS. About these Bloom is wildly mistaken (and his teacher Molly also, it seems), but even Catholics are given different accounts of their meaning. In one version, they too refer to the cross: before the emperor Constantine went into battle behind an image of the cross, an angel told him that he would conquer In Hoc Signo (In This Sign). Another gloss of the letters is Iesus Hominum Salvator (Jesus, Savior of Mankind). But both ancient Latin phrases arose as false constructions of the Greek ΙΗΣ, a contracted form of IHΣΟΥΣ (Jesus). The Bloom family version lives on in Circe: \"I have sinned, I have suff...\""

Kinch here. Put me on to Edenville. Aleph, alpha: nought, nought, one.\"",
    "expandedNote": " Entwined umbilical cords become telephone cables enabling Stephen to connect to the paradisal suburb of Edenville (there was, in fact, an actual Dublin area called Edenville, off Merrion Avenue Upper). Dial the first Hebrew letter and the first Greek one (doubly invoking the biblical saying that God is the alpha and the omega), add \"nought\" and \"nought\" (doubly invoking primeval nothingness) to get \"one\" (the splendor of divine creation), and presto! you are on the phone with Adam and Eve, by a miracle of ancient technology. Stephen is clearly enjoying himself here, and—as in a mummer's play—his comedy involves resuscitation of the dead. \n Telephones were fairly commonplace in Dublin by 1904, and they figure in several parts of Ulysses. The second such appearance, in Hades, seems to bear some occultcorrespondence to Stephen's whimsical thought in Proteus: Leopold Bloom thinks that perhaps undertakers should provide \"a telephone in the coffin\" to rescue living people who get buried by mistake, and shortly later he imagines being able to hear the voices of people who have died: \"Have a gramophone in every grave or keep it in the house. After dinner on a Sunday. Put on poor old greatgrandfather. Kraahraark! Hellohellohello amawfullyglad kraark awfullygladaseeagain hellohello amawf krpthsth.\" In both men's fantasies, the dead can be brought back to talk to the living.\n In Oxen of the Sun, Stephen continues to play with the fancy of having a direct connection to humanity's original perfection, but there the metaphor of telephony gives way to anastomosis."

  "060038emilysinico": {
    "note": " Three times in Ulysses, Bloom recalls the death of \"Mrs Emily Sinico,\" bringing back to Joyce's readers the sadness of her death at the end of \"A Painful Case.\" The Dublinersstory memorably casts her as an aging, lonely woman seeking intimacy outside of a loveless marriage. When the man she falls in love with rejects her sexual overture, and she dies, she becomes for him a searing reminder of his passionless, isolated existence. Some readers of Ulysses are convinced that this is the unnamed man who appears clad in a macintosh near Paddy Dignam's grave in Hades.",
    "expandedNote": " Emily Sinico was not a real person, but Joyce named her after his singing teacher in Trieste in 1905, Giuseppe Sinico. Emily acquired the Italian name by marrying a man whose \"great-great-grandfather had come from Leghorn.\" As the captain of a merchant vessel he spends long periods away from home, and he has \"dismissed his wife so sincerely from his gallery of pleasures that he did not suspect that anyone else would take an interest in her.\"\n But a man named James Duffy, a sternly intellectual and somberly ascetic young bachelor whom Joyce based in some measure on his brother Stanislaus, does take an interest in Mrs. Sinico. He meets her at a music concert where she has come with a daughter approximately his age. After a couple of other chance meetings he finds the courage to ask Mrs. Sinico out. They have many quiet evening walks, but he dislikes subterfuge, so he begins coming to her house, where her husband assumes he is courting the daughter. Although Mrs. Sinico is old enough to be his mother and displays a maternal solicitude, the relationship is clearly charged with erotic interest. The two become intimate, but Duffy remains caught up in the idea of himself: \"He thought that in her eyes he would ascend to an angelical stature; and, as he attached the fervent nature of his companion more and more closely to him, he heard the strange impersonal voice which he recognised as his own, insisting on the soul’s incurable loneliness. We cannot give ourselves, it said: we are our own.\" When Mrs. Sinico passionately seizes his hand one night and presses it to her cheek, he decides to break off the relationship. \n Four years later, Mr. Duffy is having supper in a Dublin restaurant when he notices a story in an evening newspaper of \"an inquest on the body of Mrs Emily Sinico, aged forty-three years, who was killed at Sydney Parade Station yesterday evening.\" Sydney Parade Avenue, and the railway station on it, now part of DART, are in Merrion, just south of Sandymount. A slow-moving train struck Mrs. Sinico there as she crossed the tracks one night. At the inquest, her husband and daughter have testified that she began drinking immoderately about two years earlier and often went out at night \"to buy spirits.\" The coroner's judgment, repeated in the subtitle of the newspaper article, is that this is \"a painful case,\" with no blame attaching to the driver of the train. \n The story's title applies equally well, however, to Mr. Duffy. His first reaction to the sad news is censorious disgust: \"What an end! The whole narrative of her death revolted him and it revolted him to think that he had ever spoken to her of what he held sacred. . . . Not merely had she degraded herself; she had degraded him. He saw the squalid tract of her vice, miserable and malodorous. His soul's companion! He thought of the hobbling wretches whom he had seen carrying cans and bottles to be filled by the barman. Just God, what an end! Evidently she had been unfit to live, without any strength of purpose, an easy prey to habits, one of the wrecks on which civilisation has been reared. . . . He remembered her outburst of that night and interpreted it in a harsher sense than he had ever done. He had no difficulty now in approving of the course he had taken.\"\n Duffy's moral blindness makes for tough reading, but as the evening goes on he becomes a painful case in a still stronger sense. He feels her hand touch his, feels her voice touch his ear. He wonders what he could possibly have done with a married woman: \"He could not have carried on a comedy of deception with her; he could not have lived with her openly.\" He thinks of how lonely she must have been, and realizes that his own life is no less impoverished. He reproaches himself: \"Why had he withheld life from her? Why had he sentenced her to death? He felt his moral nature falling to pieces.\" Seeing some lovers in the grass, \"Those venal and furtive loves filled him with despair. He gnawed the rectitude of his life; he felt that he had been outcast from life's feast. One human being had seemed to love him and he had denied her life and happiness: he had sentenced her to ignominy, a death of shame.\" At the end of the story he feels profoundly \"alone.\" \n Ithaca gives a precise date to these events when Bloom reaches into the waistcoat of his black funeral suit and finds \"a silver coin (1 shilling), placed there (presumably) on the occasion (17 October 1903) of the interment of Mrs Emily Sinico, Sydney Parade.\" He has thought in Hades that the \"Last time I was here was Mrs Sinico’s funeral.\" Nothing in the novel explains how Bloom knew Mrs. Sinico, or how well (this chapter shows that he does attend funerals of people he barely knows), but he clearly has taken a strong interest in her. Earlier in Ithaca he goes out of his way to ask Stephen whether he knows this woman \"accidentally killed at Sydney Parade railway station, 14 October 1903.\" Stephen's answer—no—increases the sad impression that only a few people in the world had any inkling of who Emily Sinico really was. \n One other person at Paddy Dignam's funeral may be echoing Bloom in thinking about the unhappy woman. In Cyclops, one of the mocking narrative voices observes that \"The man in the brown macintosh loves a lady who is dead.\" Joyce's critics will probably never definitively establish the identity of this enigmatic figure, but for many readers his ghostly passage through the pages of Ulysses continues the painful story of James Duffy, a man whose face was \"of the brown tint of Dublin streets,\" and who was last seen haunted by the memory of the love he turned away."

  "010033epioinopaponton": {
    "note": " \"Epi oinopa ponton,\" a phrase used often in Homer's Odyssey, means “upon the wine-colored sea,” which the poem's English-language translators have often rendered as \"wine-dark.\" Mulligan’s attribution in Telemachus, “snotgreen,” casts a sarcastic light on this venerated epic coloring of the ocean. But Stephen recalls the phrase in Proteus and restores its Homeric tinge: \"oinopa ponton, a winedark sea.\"",
    "expandedNote": " As the novel progresses, Stephen continues to brood on the phrase. In Wandering Rocks he looks through a jeweller's window at dust piled on \"dull coils of bronze and silver, lozenges of cinnabar, on rubies, leprous and winedark stones.\" In Ithaca he sits across from Bloom and sees a Christ-figure \"with winedark hair,\" the darkness perhaps speaking to the metaphysical darkness that he pondered in Nestor. In Cyclops, the Citizen too recalls this phrase as he pontificates about Irish trade in beer and wine with the Continent: \"the winebark on the winedark waterway.\"\n Epi oinopa ponton is one of many formulaic epithets that the Homeric bards used as easily remembered and metrically friendly crutches to fill spaces in lines. Many of these epithets in the Iliad and the Odyssey involve color, as Joyce may have noted when he called the Blooms' chamberpot \"orangekeyed.\""

  "030098epiphanies": {
    "note": " In an earlier novel, Stephen had theorized about literary \"epiphanies\"—sudden spiritual manifestations, in his words. In Proteus, he mocks these ineffable insights mercilessly. But the concept of the epiphany was fundamental to Joyce's shift from writing poetry to writing prose fiction.",
    "expandedNote": " In Stephen Hero, the protagonist is walking down Eccles Street one evening when he passes a young woman \"standing on the steps of one of those brown brick houses which seem the very incarnation of Irish paralysis.\" A young man is leaning on the railings talking to her, and Stephen hears her softly speaking flirtatious, tempting words. The incident makes him think of \"collecting many such moments together in a book of epiphanies. By an epiphany he meant a sudden spiritual manifestation, whether in the vulgarity of speech or of gesture or in a memorable phase of the mind itself. He believed that it was for the man of letters to record these epiphanies with extreme care, seeing that they themselves are the most delicate and evanescent of moments.\" \n Stephen tells a dubious Cranly that even \"the clock of the Ballast Office was capable of an epiphany. . . . I will pass it time after time, allude to it, refer to it, catch a glimpse of it. It is only an item in the catalogue of Dublin's street furniture. Then all at once I see it and I know at once what it is: epiphany\" (211). He goes on to explain that this is the instant in which the object reveals its quidditas or \"whatness\" (213)—when, Gifford infers, \"the metaphoric potential of an object (or a moment, gesture, phrase, etc.) is realized.\"\n Like Stephen with Cranly, Joyce was telling his companions about these spiritual revelations at the same time that he was writing Stephen Hero. Theodore Spencer's introduction to Stephen Hero notes that Oliver Gogarty mentions the term in his autobiography, As I was Walking down Sackville Street (Reynal & Hitchcock, 1937). Joyce excused himself from a certain gathering and left the room, prompting Gogarty to write, \"I don't mind being reported, but to be an unwilling contributor to one of his Epiphanies is irritating. / Probably Fr. Darlington had taught him as an aside in his Latin class—for Joyce knew no Greek—that 'Epiphany' meant 'a showing forth.' So he recorded under 'Epiphany' any showing forth of the mind by which he considered one gave oneself away. / Which of us had endowed him with an 'Epiphany' and sent him to the lavatory to take it down?\" (295).\n Joyce certainly did think of epiphanies in this way, but he also had religious connotations in mind, since he was beginning to think of his fiction as performing secular functions comparable to the magic of church rituals. Richard Ellmann notes that he was coming to think of Christianity as \"a system of metaphors, which as metaphors could claim his fierce allegiance.\" Literary fiction could be conceived as a kind of transubstantiation, \"transmuting the daily bread of experience into the radiant body of eternal life\" (A Portrait, 240). \n In August 1904 Joyce wrote to a friend that he was writing \"a series of epicleti\" called Dubliners that would \"betray the soul of that hemiplegia or paralysis which many consider a city\" (Letters, 55). The term epicleti, taken from the Greek Orthodox liturgy, refers to the moment of transubstantiation. In a letter to his brother Stanislaus, Joyce wrote that \"there is a certain resemblance between the mystery of the mass and what I am trying to do.\" He was trying, he said, to give his readers \"a kind of intellectual pleasure or spiritual enjoyment by converting the bread of everyday life into something that has a permanent artistic life of its own\" (quoted in Robert Scholes and A. Walton Lizt, eds., Dubliners: Text, Criticism, and Notes, 250). \n The Epiphany, in the Christian calendar, is usually celebrated on January 6. The word can refer to the showing of the Christ child to the Magi or, alternatively, to the baptism of Jesus in the River Jordan, during which the \"Spirit of God\" descended \"like a dove\" and a voice from heaven said, \"This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased\" (Matthew 3:16-17). Both stories describe a manifestation of divinity. Joyce did not use the term in quite the same way. His epiphanies were insights into the essential nature of mundane realities, not into godhead. As Gogarty recognized, they could be a manifestation or \"showing forth of the mind by which he considered one gave oneself away\"—or a moment in which an object revealed something essential about itself. They might give spiritual exaltation to the reader, but only by symbolizing the ways in which Dublin worked—not by symbolizing otherworldly realities. In Proteus Stephen seems to be mocking himself for the air of spiritualism, \"deeply deep,\" that nevertheless clung to the use of terms like epicleti and epiphanies.\n The concept of the epiphany has real relevance to Joyce's literary practice. He used the label for at least 40 (and perhaps more than 70) short sketches that he wrote between 1898 and January 1904. Some of these are summarized on a webpage published by The James Joyce Centre at http://jamesjoyce.ie/epiphanies. Although he never followed through on what apparently was his intention to collect them in a book, Joyce did later incorporate some of his epiphanies in Stephen Hero, A Portrait, Dubliners, and Ulysses. A critical book by Robert Scholes and Richard M. Kain, The Workshop of Daedalus: James Joyce and the raw materials for A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (Northwestern UP, 1965), details some of these reuses.\n Various scholars have used the term to name the effects that conclude stories in Dubliners, in which an image of some human action or thought, or of some object or event, seems to capture the hopelessness of the characters' lives. And for all his embarrassment about his earlier epiphanies, Stephen seems to be heading down the same road. At the end of Aeolus, he tells a vignette about \"Dubliners\" which concludes with the image of two aged virgins spitting plum seeds off the top of Nelson's pillar."

  "030122equinefaces": {
    "note": " When Stephen thinks of \"The oval equine faces, Temple, Buck Mulligan, Foxy Campbell, Lanternjaws,\" the references to people are clear enough but his purposes in mentioning them are obscure. Temple was one of the students at UCD (University College, Dublin) who companioned Stephen in Part V of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. Buck Mulligan is his present companion. And Father Richard Campbell was one of his teachers at Belvedere College, whom he thinks of in Part IV ofA Portrait as a jesuit \"whom some of the boys called Lantern Jaws and others Foxy Campbell.\"",
    "expandedNote": " Mulligan's face was described in Telemachus as \"equine in its length,\" and in A Portrait Temple has \"dark oval eyes,\" so these two characters are responsible for Stephen's thought of \"oval equine faces.\" Campbell is mentioned only briefly in A Portrait, as Stephen imagines becoming a jesuit priest himself and experiences the \"mental sensation of an undefined face or colour of a face. The colour faded and became strong like a changing glow of pallid brick red. Was it the raw reddish glow he had so often seen on wintry mornings on the shaven gills of the priests? The face was eyeless and sour-favoured and devout, shot with pink tinges of suffocated anger.\" He thinks that he may have derived this apparition from the face of Father Campbell. \n The amalgamation of these three faces into one raises more questions than can be easily answered. Is Stephen thinking of his near escape from the clutches of the priesthood? His reflection that Beauty does not reside in the theological tomes of Marsh's library, within \"the cathedral close,\" is followed by nearly three paragraphs of thoughts about priests and his own \"awfully holy\" phase. And Mulligan was imitating a priest in Telemachus when Stephen thought of his face as \"equine.\" But nothing beyond Temple's name connects him to the clergy. This \"gipsy-like student\" who hangs on Stephen's every utterance is a socialist and a Republican, and strongly anti-clerical. \n According to Ellmann, Temple was modeled on a Dublin medical student named John Elwood who kept company with Joyce and Gogarty in 1903 and 1904, and other scholars (Kathleen Ferris, Gordon Bowker) have written about this man's minor role in Joyce's life and writing. So the conjunction \"Temple, Buck Mulligan\" makes sense. But a generalizing inference that the \"oval equine faces\" belong to young men who have briefly attached themselves to the artist's genius is negated by the presence of Father Campbell, and makes little sense in the context of Stephen's thoughts in this section ofProteus.\n Still more questions attach to the equine imagery. Stephen imagines Jonathan Swift not merely as a Gulliverian horse-lover but as himself a horse, running from the irrational mob to \"the wood of madness, his mane foaming in the moon.\" He associates the brilliant Swift with the brilliant Joachim, another member of the clergy: \"Abbas father, furious dean, what offence laid fire to their brains?\" It is not entirely clear what kind of balance Stephen is striking between admiration for the genius of these two writers and dismay at their (essentially religious?) flight from the all-too-human. Things become murkier still when he associates Swift, and by extension Joachim, with the \"equine\" Mulligan, Temple, and Campbell. Did any offense lay fire to the brains of these three?"

  "030102viditdeus": {
    "note": " Not least of the bewildering ways in which Proteus plunges the reader into the waves of Stephen's thoughts, with little connection to the dry land of plot, dialogue, and action, is its refusal to translate his kaleidoscopic multilingualism into English. Along with French and Italian, he thinks frequently in the church language of Latin, where he has an impressive command thanks to the rigorous Jesuit education in which he excelled. This note glosses five easily glossable phrases.",
    "expandedNote": " \"Duces Tecum\" is a legal phrase, which Stephen thinks of in connection with the law-court work that his uncle Richie is doing at home. Literally \"Bring with you,\" it is a form of subpoena (\"a writ\") requiring the person who is handed the summons to bring certain documents or other forms of evidence into court. \n \"Terribilia meditans\" means \"meditating on terrible things,\" which Stephen is doing as he thinks of being \"bayed about\" by a hostile dog. Commentators have been unable to locate any precise allusion in the phrase, so Stephen probably has coined it.\n \"Omnis caro ad te veniet\" means \"All flesh will come to you.\" It recites Psalm 65:2 (\"O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come\"). Thornton notes that it is chanted in the Introibo or Introit (the priest's entrance chant) that begins the funeral mass. Stephen is thinking about his mother's death as he mentally recites this line, and it is reasonable to assume that he is continuing to indulge his fantasy of God as a carnivorous killer. He recalls the phrase again in Oxen of the Sun.\n \"Et vidit Deus. Et erant valde bona\" means \"And God saw (them). And they were very good.\" It paraphrases the Latin of the Vulgate in Genesis 1:31, \"viditque Deus cuncta quae fecit et erant valde bona\" (\"and God saw the things that he had made, and they were very good\"). Stephen is remembering Kevin Egan's way of lying back for a \"sabbath sleep,\" i.e. a Sunday nap. The words from Genesis describe the very first sabbath nap, after God's six busy days of Creation. Stephen's whimsy in transforming Kevin Egan into a god pleased with his handiwork seems friendly, and Egan's greeting is as well, as he looks up from his nap to see that Stephen has arrived.\n \"Tripudium\" means something like a \"triple beat\" of feet on the ground. It is a Latin word for religious dances, associated with solemn rejoicing. Stephen thinks of some unspecified time in the past when his foot \"beat the ground in tripudium,\" and in Circe his foot does so again. \n Separate notes discuss the use of Latin in other passages ofProteus that require more discussion: Aquinas' concept of a \"lex eterna,\"Ambrose's sentence \"diebus ac noctibus iniurias patiens ingemiscit,\" the Joachim-inspired sentence \"Descende, calve, ut ne nimium devalveris,\" and the strange conflation of Christ and Satan in \"Lucifer, dico, qui nescit occasum.\""

    "note": " As people go about their day on the streets of Dublin they see \"hoardings,\" or billboards, advertising a show to be performed by \"Mr Eugene Stratton.\" Eugene Augustus Ruhlmann, a white American from Buffalo, NY, performed under that name in blackface, dancing and singing \"coon songs.\"",
    "expandedNote": " Gifford notes that Stratton \"toured primarily in the British Isles, first with a minstrel group and then as a solo performer\" (108). He was billed as a comedian, but his act consisted chiefly of singing, whistling, and dancing. The stage was usually darkened, and a spotlight shone dramatically on Stratton's face. David Pierce notes that \"He was popular with other professionals, and in 1896 and again in 1900 he was named King Rat. The Chieftains play a hornpipe named after him\" (127). His songs, Pierce observes, included \"The Whistling Coon\" and \"The Dandy Coloured Coon.\" He performed from the 1880s into the 1900s to great acclaim, and ads in the 16 June 1904 Freeman's Journal and Evening Telegraph, as well as posters on the hoardings, proclaimed that \"the World Renowned Comedian\" would be playing at the Theatre Royal in Hawkins Street.\n In Circe Bloom (who saw one of the posted ads through the window of his carriage in Hades) thinks of Stratton in connection with \"Negro servants in livery,\" \"Othello black brute,\" and the \"Bohee brothers\": \"The exotic, you see.\" The narrative then generates a stage performance in keeping with the Negro impersonator theme: \"Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks, upstarched Sambo chokers and large scarlet asters in their buttonholes, leap out. Each has his banjo slung. Their paler smaller negroid hands jingle the twingtwang wires. Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they rattle through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to back, toe heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips.\" \n Later in the chapter, Elijah (a.k.a. John Alexander Dowie) morphs into Stratton by becoming \"black in the face\" and lapsing into faux Negro dialect: \"Big Brother up there, Mr President, you hear what I done just been saying to you. Certainly, I sort of believe strong in you, Mr President. I certainly am thinking now Miss Higgins and Miss Ricketts got religion way inside them. Certainly seems to me I don't never see no wusser scared female than the way you been, Miss Florry, just now as I done seed you.\"\n The appallingly racist comedy at the expense of black Americans in several parts of Ulysses can no doubt be attributed to the talented Eugene Ruhlmann's stage portrayals, to their huge popularity in Ireland, and to the absence of other black people, fictional or real, that might have supplied more affirmative images to the popular imagination. Still, anyone who knows and appreciates Joyce's fiction would think that an artist so savvy about popular culture, and so deeply humane, might himself have done more to imaginatively inhabit the lives effaced by these invidious stereotypes about an oppressed class of human beings."

In 1904, however, its circulation was much smaller than those of the Telegraph, the Freeman's Journal, and the Irish Times, all of which had gained national readerships. By this time the Mailhad become a staunchly unionist paper. Its editors took conservative positions on issues like land reform during the last decades of the 19th century, and opposed Gladstone's negotiations with Parnell for Home Rule. \n In \"A Painful Case,\" Mr. Duffy sits in a restaurant eating corned beef and cabbage and staring at \"a paragraph in the evening paper which he had propped against the water-carafe.\" After losing his appetite and walking off into the night, the narrative notices \"the fringe of the buff Mail peeping out of a side-pocket of his tight reefer overcoast.\" At home in his bedroom, he takes the paper out of the pocket and reads the article again. The narrative reproduces the newspaper headline:\n DEATH OF A LADY AT SYDNEY PARADE\n A PAINFUL CASE\nThe extensive text that follows (566 words) seems to present the newspaper article nearly verbatim, anticipating Aelous in its willingness to incorporate the conventions of print journalism into a literary fiction.\n Among other items of interest for 16 June 1904, the image of the first page of that day's Mail accompanying this note contains announcements of Mrs. Bandmann Palmer appearing in Leah at the Gaiety Theatre (upper left), and Eugene Stratton appearing at the Theatre Royal (immediately to the right)."

The Telegraph and the Freeman were published from offices in the same building on Prince's Street North, and they professed similar nationalist politics. These two dailies receive far more mentions in Ulysses than any other newspapers.",
    "expandedNote": " In response to Mr. Deasy's request that Stephen place his editorial letter in two newspapers, Stephen thinks of two where he knows editors: \"Telegraph. Irish Homestead.\" Asked to name them, he gets out one (\"The Evening Telegraph...\") before Deasy rudely cuts him off. Most of Aeolus takes place in the offices of the Telegraph, where Stephen's errand from the headmaster brings him in search of the editor, Myles Crawford. Bloom comes there a bit later in search of the same man. Having started out in the offices of the Freeman's Journal, where he discusses the design of an ad with the newspaper's foreman, he walks next door to talk to Crawford about placing \"a little puff\" for the advertiser's business in the Telegraph. \n In Proteus Stephen realizes that he lacks paper to record his thoughts for a poem and turns to one of Deasy's two letters: \"Paper. The banknotes, blast them. Old Deasy's letter. Here. Thanking you for the hospitality tear the blank end off. Turning his back to the sun he bent over far to a table of rock and scribbled words. That's twice I forgot to take slips from the library counter.\" In the newspaper office in Aeolus, he begins his overture to Myles Crawford by thinking of how he has mutilated the letter he is about to hand over: \"Bit torn off.\" He says, \"Mr Garrett Deasy,\" and the mere mention of the name sends the editor off into a tirade of abuse. \"Good day, sir, Stephen answered, blushing. The letter is not mine. Mr Garrett Deasy asked me to...\" We never learn if he gets farther into his appeal than this, but some time later it does seem that Crawford has heard him and will consider printing the letter: \"Myles Crawford crammed the sheets into a sidepocket. / — That'll be all right, he said. I'll read the rest after. That'll be all right.\"\n Two later chapters make clear that Crawford did indeed include the letter in Thursday evening's edition of theTelegraph. In Oxen of the Sun Lenehan comes \"to the feet of the table to say how the letter was in that night's gazette and he made a show to find it about him (for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it) but on Stephen's persuasion he gave over the search.\" In Eumaeus Bloom finds a copy lying about in the cabman's shelter, and thinks of a disrespectful Dublin pun: \"The pink edition extra sporting of the Telegraph tell a graphic lie lay, as luck would have it, beside his elbow.\" He opens the paper, glances at various articles, hands part of the paper to Stephen, and reads part himself. Among the items recorded in his thoughts is \"Foot and mouth.\" Recorded, also, is the fact that the funeral for Patrick Dignam was attended by \"Stephen Dedalus, B. A.\"—a non-fact that amuses Bloom greatly.\n Of greater significance in the evening's Telegraph, however, is the announcement of the results of the Gold Cup race of June 16. In Nausicaa, Bloom hears \"a shrill voice\" hawking papers by promising news of the race results: \"Evening Telegraph, stop press edition! Result of the Gold Cup race!\" In the cabman's shelter in Eumaeus he reads an account of the race on page 3. The story can be seen in the image at right, page 3, column 8, under \"SPORTING.\" In Ithaca Bloom thinks again about the race, \"the official and definitive result of which he had read in the Evening Telegraph, late pink edition, in the cabman's shelter, at Butt bridge.\" \n Other things catch Bloom's attention when he looks at the paper in Eumaeus, most of which actually appeared in the Telegraph on this date. The \"Gordon Bennett\" race is discussed at length on page 2. The \"New York disaster, thousand lives lost\" appears on page 2 and page 4. \"Great battle Tokio\" occupies the last column of page 2 and the beginning of page 3. \"Emigration Swindle\" from police court is reported on page 3. \"Lovemaking in Irish, £ 200 damages,\" a breach of promise case, is covered on page 3. On some subjects, however, Joyce added features of his own invention. No letter about foot and mouth disease appears in the actual paper. Nor does the funeral of the late Patrick Dignam. \n The Telegraph makes one fantastic appearance in Circe, when the newspaper-seller Davy Stephens passes by \"with a bevy of barefoot newsboys\" like the ones that mocked Bloom in Aeolus. Stephens is hawking the \"Messenger of the Sacred Heart and Evening Telegraph with Saint Patrick's Day supplement. Containing the new addresses of all the cuckolds in Dublin.\""

The call for \"everyman\" to confront his death suggests an allusion to the medieval morality play Everyman, but neither this paragraph nor the following one resembles it stylistically. Their most distinctive verbal mannerism is constant repetition of the words \"man\" and \"woman\"—a feature which is not characteristic of the play. It may be intended to suggest a sermon in Middle English.",
    "expandedNote": "Stuart Gilbert (1930) heard in this section \"an anticipation of an early Church style which is in advance of its context in the episode\" (279). It would be interesting to know his basis for making that claim. Weldon Thornton (1968), in sharp contrast, heard an allusion to the prologue of Everyman, which would mean that Joyce was jumping ahead of the historical context, going directly from the late 10th century to the late 15th. Robert Janusko (1983) was persuaded by Thornton's identification. Don Gifford (1988) agrees that the first paragraph echoes the play's prologue, but he characterizes the entire section, quite unspecifically, as \"Middle English prose.\" Declan Kiberd (1992) appears to believe that the influence of the play continues through both paragraphs, and Jeri Johnson (1993) makes that claim explicitly. Sam Slote (2012), who like Thornton does not attempt to characterize the styles of the chapter, does agree that the first sentence alludes to Everyman. \n Like other morality plays, Everyman uses personified abstractions to represent its protagonist's struggle for spiritual wellbeing. Summoned to appear before God and make an account of his life (the play's full title is The Somonyng of Everyman), Everyman tries to convince Fellowship, Kindred, Cousin, and Goods to accompany him, but they all refuse. Good Deeds feels too weak to join him, but she introduces him to her sister Knowledge and he goes with her to see Confession, after which Good Deeds feels strong enough to make the journey. At the end of the play, Everyman climbs into his grave with Good Deeds, dies, and ascends to heaven, the lesson being that your good deeds, justified by God's grace, are all that you can take with you.\n The play apparently was performed often in the decades following its composition, and a modern stage adaptation with a female lead was performed in the U.K. and the U.S. from 1901 to 1918. Two films based on the adaptation were released in 1913 and 1914. Joyce might well have heard of one or another of these recent enactments. He would not have encountered any excerpts from the script in Saintsbury's or Peacock's anthologies of English prose, because it consists entirely of verse lines, but he does seem to have perused the text of the play. The allusion that Thornton detected occurs in the Messenger's prologue: \n Man, in the beginning,\n Look well, and take good heed to the ending,\n Be you never so gay.\n You think sin in the beginning full sweet,\n Which in the end causeth the soul to weep,\n When the body lieth in clay.\n Here shall you see how fellowship and jollity,\n Both strength, pleasure, and beauty,\n Will fade from thee as a flower in May.\n For ye shall hear how our Heaven-King\n Calleth Everyman to a general reckoning.\n Joyce's echo of these lines (\"Therefore, everyman, look to that last end that is thy death\") seems to be prompted by the fact that Bloom and nurse Callan have been talking in the previous paragraph about an unexpected death. Bloom's black clothes have made the nurse fear some \"sorrow,\" but she learns that no one dear to him has died. His cheerful inquiry about Doctor O'Hare, however, produces the news that this \"young\" man has died of cancer. Callan, who is pious, prays for \"God the Allruthful to have his dear soul in his undeathliness,\" and the two stand \"sorrowing one with another.\" The hope that God will save the dead man's soul triggers a new section of narrative keyed to the lines from Everyman.\n The one-sentence opening paragraph then abandons the play's idiom and echoes biblical language: \"the dust that gripeth on every man that is born of woman for as he came naked forth from his mother's womb so naked shall he wend him at the last for to go as he came.\" Chapter 14 of the Book of Job begins, \"Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble. / He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not\" (1-2). Earlier, Job has said, \"Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away\" (1:21). Was Gilbert perhaps thinking of these well-known verses being used in medieval homiletic writing when he argued that the passage was written in an \"early Church style\"? There is no way of knowing, but clearly the image of man born of a woman exerts a much stronger influence on the following paragraph than does anything in Everyman. \n Bloom is now \"the man\" who has come into the hospital, and Callan is \"the nursingwoman.\" He asks her not about Mrs. Purefoy but about \"the woman that lay there in childbed. The nursingwoman answered him and said that that woman was in throes now full three days.\" She says that \"she had seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was that woman's birth,\" and \"The man hearkened to her words for he felt with wonder women's woe in the travail that they have of motherhood.\" Until some reader discovers a medieval text that recurs to these two words with comparable regularity, Joyce's second paragraph should probably be regarded as a riff on verses from the Book of Job, perhaps in the style of a real or imagined medieval sermon. Gifford's \"Middle English prose\" is frustratingly generic, but his instincts seem keener than those of Janusko, Kiberd, and Johnson, for whom the fact that Everyman is written in verse never even registers as a problem.\n This section echoes Middle English vocabulary much more sparingly than the previous one echoed Old English. Only one word needs glossing: \"unneth\" recalls the Middle Englishuneathe or unethe = difficult, not easy. This word derived from an Old English one, uneaþe, and the second paragraph contains several such echoes of the past. Bloom's asking \"how it fared with the woman\" may possibly be heard as a reprise of the previous section's echoes of \"faring\" in Ælfric's life of St. Cuthbert. There are also several instances of alliteration in something like the Anglo-Saxon manner. The most striking ones come near the end: it is said that Bloom \"felt with wonder women's woe,\" and when he marvels that the attractive young nurse is still a \"handmaid\" (i.e., not married) nine years after he first met her in the hospital, the judgmental narrative harps on her sterile menstruations: \"Nine twelve bloodflows chiding her childless.\" \n It is also worth noting that this section recapitulates the false-start quality of the previous one. There, two sentences powerfully reminiscent of Old English verse relapsed into a Latinate style, before settling into five paragraphs of Anglo-Saxon prose in which an alliterative poem plays only a thematic role. Here, the action begins with half a sentence reminiscent of a late medieval verse play, before settling into a paragraph that sounds like the (earlier?) Middle English prose that Joyce's historical model might lead one to expect. Joyce evidently had some fun painting outside the chronological and generic outlines of his design. He also clearly enjoyed letting new narrative settings express themselves in new styles. Bloom's arrival at the hospital after wandering about all day calls for The Wanderer, even if it is not in prose. His sad talk with nurse Callan about a young doctor's death calls forEveryman, even if its dating is too late. His entrance into a common-room filled with wildly dunken talk and laughter will likewise call for some fantastic medieval travel stories."

    "note": " Contemplating his humble beginning as a small being \"lugged . . . squealing into life\" by a midwife, Stephen then thinks more ambitiously of his spiritual origins: \"Creation from nothing.\" Christian theologians have traditionally held that God created the cosmos ex nihilo, and many of them have seen the human soul in the same way. Two paragraphs later in Proteus, Stephen continues to think of himself according to these dualistic alternatives. He is a poor material creature \"Wombed in sin darkness,\" but also an eternally existing soul, willed into existence by divine fiat \"From before the ages.\"",
    "expandedNote": " The first verse of Genesis says that \"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.\" It does not say whether or not God created these things from some pre-existing material, but by the 2nd century AD Christian theologians were arguing that their God brought the world into being from nothing, as opposed to Gnostic accounts of a demiurge who fashioned it from primordial matter. A verse of 2 Maccabees (a second-century book deemed canonical by the Catholic church) says, \"I beseech thee, my son, look upon the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein, and consider that God made them of things that were not, and so was mankind made likewise\" (7:28). \n This account of the creation of mankind seems to conflict with the statement in Genesis that God created man from \"dust\" (Genesis 2:7). Later philosophers, however—authorized by the following words of the verse, \"And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul\"—took pains to distinguish between the fleshly part of human nature and an immortal part called the rational soul which God makes in special, additional acts of creation ex nihilo. Stephen's beloved Thomas Aquinas argues that \"The rational soul can be made only by creation,\" meaning that it \"cannot be produced, save immediately by God\" (Summa Theologica 1.90.2-3).\n In canto 25 of Dante's Purgatorio, Statius gives a materialistic account of the growth of the vegetative and the animal souls in the human embryo, during the first few months of gestation, followed by a description of how God intervenes in the process to breathe a rational soul into the embryo: \"once the brain's articulation / in the embryo arrives at its perfection, / the First Mover turns to it, rejoicing / in such handiwork of nature, and breathes / into it a spirit, new and full of power, / which then draws into its substance / all it there finds active and becomes a single soul / that lives, and feels, and reflects upon itself\" (68-75). The rational soul, immortal and eternal, subsumes into itself the lesser forms of soul (plant and animal) that would otherwise be perishable. \n Armed with this traditional way of thinking, Stephen makes sharp distinctions between the material part of his being and a spiritual dimension that exists eternally. His father and mother (\"the man with my voice and my eyes and a ghostwoman with ashes on her breath\") produced him by an act of sexual intercourse: they \"clasped and sundered, did the coupler's will.\" In this sexual sense, Stephen was \"made not begotten\"—unlike the divine Christ, who according to the Nicene Creed was \"begotten, but not made, of one essence consubstantial with the Father.\" (Begetting, as used in the Creed, is a theological term describing the mysterious, and only metaphorically sexual, relationship between two persons, Father and Son, who are \"of one essence,\" \"consubstantial,\" but nonetheless distinct.)\n After thinking of himself as \"made not begotten,\" however, Stephen turns to the spiritual account: \"From before the ages He willed me and now may not will me away or ever. A lex eterna stays about Him.\" Gifford traces the \"eternal law\" to Summa Theologica 1.91.1: \"The ruling idea of things which exists in God as the effective sovereign of them all has the nature of law. Then since God's mind does not conceive in time, but has an eternal concept . . . it follows that this law should be called eternal. Hence: 1. While not as yet existing in themselves things nevertheless exist in God in so far as they are foreseen and preordained by Him; so St. Paul speaks of God summoning things that are not yet in existence as if they already were. Thus the eternal concept of divine law bears the character of a law that is eternal as being God's ordination for the governance of things he foreknows.\" \n Stephen's soul, then (combining the logic of this passage with what Aquinas says about the creation of the rational soul one question earlier in the Summa and what Dante says about embryology), did not come into actual existence until the moment it was infused into his gestating pre-rational body, but its existence was willed outside of time and thus exists in God for all eternity. And, since God's thinking \"has the nature of law,\" it might be said (though here Stephen is flirting with heresy, as one of his teachers accuses him of doing in A Portrait of the Artist) that God is not able ever to will him into nonexistence. His existence is not only eternal, but guaranteed so. \n Anyone who has followed Stephen's thoughts to these absurdly logical conclusions (and Joyce clearly insists that any worthy reader should do so) may be forgiven for thinking that Stephen's fundamental premise is deeply flawed (and Joyce probably intends for his reader to draw exactly this conclusion). The relentlessly logical training that has made Stephen \"a fearful jesuit\" even in his apostasy, and the puritanical Irish Catholic consciousness of sin that has made him a misogynist even in his hungrily gratified desire for female flesh, pale in significance before the mind-body dualism that he has absorbed from his religious upbringing. Caught between the material conception of himself as a miserable animal \"wombed in sin darkness\" and the spiritual sense that he may perhaps even participate in \"the divine substance wherein Father and Son are consubstantial,\" where can Stephen look for a sane understanding of his human personality? \n Many moments in his thinking—his contemplation of the \"dogsbody\" that \"moves to one great goal,\" his description of God as \"a shout in the street,\" his fantasy of God becoming man becoming fish, his notion of God as a killer, his theory of Shakespeare as a god who creates out of his sexual unhappiness—indicate that Stephen is acutely aware of the need to break down false dichotomies of the material and the spiritual. But not until he encounters Bloom will life give him a model for how these two aspects of experience may harmoniously interpenetrate. For the atheistical Bloom, human mentality may be satisfactorily explained as a materialistic phenomenon. But, caught in \"the stream of life\" in which all things come into and pass out of being, the human body-mind perpetually flowers into a kind of eternal life."

  "030082famineplagueslaughters": {
    "note": " After thinking back to the 8th, 9th, and 10th centuries, when Viking longboats ran up on the beaches, Stephen apparently turns his mind to the 14th century, when \"Famine, plague, and slaughters\" decimated the Irish population. He mentions two dramatic occurrences from that time: the stranding of \"A school of turlehide whales\" in 1331, and an unusually cold winter in 1338 that allowed Dubliners to play on \"the frozen Liffey.\"",
    "expandedNote": " Gifford notes that the beaching of the whales occurred when Dublin was in the midst of a terrible famine. His source is the \"Dublin Annals\" section of Thom's 1904: \"a prodigious shoal of fish called Turlehydes was cast on shore at the mouth of the Dodder near the mouth of the Liffey. They were from 30 to 40 feet long, and so thick that men standing on each side of one of them could not see those on the other. Upwards of 200 of them were killed by the people\" (2092). Stephen imagines hordes of citizens pouring out of \"the starving cagework city\" armed \"with flayers' knives, running, scaling, hacking in green blubbery whalemeat.\"\n He does not visualize the effects of the plague, but waves of bubonic plague did sweep across Europe in the 1330s and 1340s. Gifford notes that some scholars estimate that the disease killed half of the people living in Ireland. Again, Joyce's source may be Thom's: \"a great pestilence raged through many parts of the world, and carried off vast numbers in Dublin\" (2092). \n Ireland has endured slaughters in many eras, but some of the worst occurred in the 1310s, when \"The Bruce's brother,\" mentioned one paragraph later in Proteus, invaded Ireland from Scotland and sought to have himself proclaimed High King. Never lord of more than parts of Ulster, Edward Bruce waged war from 1315 to 1318 in attempts to expand his dominion, pillaging wherever his army went, sacking and burning many towns, and massacring the civilian population (Gaelic and Anglo-Irish alike) in at least one, Dundalk. So unpopular was he at the time of his death in 1318 that his body was decapitated and quartered, so that the whole island (and King Edward II in England) could share in the joy of his passing. \n Still one more detail from Thom's 1904 enters Stephen's thoughts, this one from 1338: \"a severe frost from the beginning of December to the beginning of February, in which the Liffey was frozen so hard that the citizens played at foot-ball, and lit fires on the ice\" (2096). Stephen imagines himself moving \"among the spluttering resin fires.\" The Liffey has frozen at other times, as the photographs at right document. Gifford notes one freeze in 1739, documented in the 1904 Thom's, hard enough \"that the people amused themselves on the ice\" (2096). But Stephen pretty clearly seems to be concentrating on the early 14th century.\n Stephen engages in a kind of time-travel in these vignettes, thinking of \"that I, a changeling,\" who lived another life in another time. It is one among many moments in Ulysses that ponder the possibility of reincarnation or \"metempsychosis.\" And, more immediately relevant for Stephen, it offers one more way in which his personal identity is wrested from protean flux. Past times inform the present, and racial experiences shape the individual: \"a horde of jerkined dwarfs, my people . . . Their blood is in me, their lusts my waves.\""

  "050052conmee": {
    "note": " \"Father Conmee\" is mentioned repeatedly in Ulysses (56 times under that name, and another 16 as \"Conmee,\" \"John Conmee, S.J.,\" \"Father John Conmee,\" and \"Don John Conmee\"). Most of the 72 mentions come in the opening section of the tenth chapter, which features him at great length. A real Jesuit priest, John Conmee (1847-1910) held positions of authority at Clongowes Wood College and Belvedere College when Joyce attended those institutions (ages 6-9 and 11-16, respectively), and he did him good turns at both. A Portrait of the Artist records these good deeds, but the opening section of Wandering Rocks gives a less flattering view: Conmee is distinguished-looking, suave, and very friendly, but he is also complacently righteous, smugly indifferent to human suffering, and given to fantasies of aristocratic grandeur. If not for the framing context of a charitable mission, several moments of appealing interior monologue, and the prevailing light tone suited to a walk on a fine summer day, one would have to term this scathing portrait a literary assassination.",
    "expandedNote": " Vivien Igoe records that Conmee was \"born into a wealthy farming family\" in County Westmeath. He studied at Clongowes from 1863 to 1867, joined the Society of Jesus at age 20 in 1867, taught in County Offaly for five years in the late 1870s, was ordained a priest in 1881, became Prefect of Studies at Clongowes soon afterward, and was Rector of the college from 1885 to 1891. In 1893 he became the Prefect of Studies at Belvedere, and in 1898 he was made \"The superior\" (the priest in charge) at the nearby St. Francis Xavier's church in Dublin, down the front steps of whose presbytery he walks at the beginning of Wandering Rocks. Shortly afterward he thinks of writing a letter \"to father provincial,\" the head of the Jesuit order in Ireland, a position to which he was himself elected in 1905, serving until 1909. His book Old Times in the Barony was published by The Catholic Truth Society in 1910, the year of his death.\n In A Portrait, a young Stephen Dedalus is subjected to unjust corporal punishment at the hands of the cruel Father Dolan. Summoning up great courage, the tiny boy walks down a forbidding dark hallway after supper to appeal directly to the rector of the college, and is subsequently cheered as a hero by his classmates. Later, Simon Dedalus throws cold water on his childish fantasy of righting wrong when he tells his wife that Conmee has informed him of their son's protest: \"—And was he annoyed, Simon? / —Annoyed? Not he! Manly little chap! he said. / Mr Dedalus imitated the mincing nasal tone of the provincial. / Father Dolan and I, when I told them all at dinner about it, Father Dolan and I had a great laugh over it. You better mind yourself, Father Dolan, said I, or young Dedalus will send you up for twice nine. We had a famous laugh together over it. Ha! Ha! Ha!\" Despite this disillusionment Stephen thinks of himself in Scylla and Charybdis as \"A child Conmee saved from pandies,\" and Conmee's kindness returns in Circe when a menacing Father Dolan threatens to flog him again: \"(Mild, benign, rectorial, reproving, the head of Don John Conmee rises from the pianola coffin.) / DON JOHN CONMEE / Now, Father Dolan! Now. I'm sure that Stephen is a very good little boy!\"\n A Portrait further records the fact that, in the time after Joyce left Clongowes (he does not represent the fact that he was briefly enrolled in the Christian Brothers school on North Richmond Street), his father ran into Father Conmee on Mountjoy Square and asked him to allow James to attend Belvedere free of charge. Conmee granted the request, saving the gifted young student from the ignominy of a Christian Brothers education (\"Paddy Stink and Micky Mud,\" in Simon's heated words). This charitable action is echoed in a comically skewed way in Ulysses. The first section ofWandering Rocks shows Conmee walking past Mountjoy Square on his way to the O'Brien Institute for Destitute Children northeast of the city. He is going to talk to the director, Brother Swan, because Martin Cunningham has asked that something be done to help Paddy Dignam's orphaned child Patsy. The O'Brien Institute was run by the Christian Brothers.\n Conmee's charitable actions on behalf of schoolboys are echoed near the beginning of Wandering Rocks when he banters jovially with three young boys from Belvedere. But other details from his half-circuit of Mountjoy Square suggest shallowness. A one-legged sailor's begging makes plain the limits of his charity: \"Father Conmee blessed him in the sun for his purse held, he knew, one silver crown.\" On brief reflection, he decides that the sailor's misfortune can be chalked up to a poor career choice: \"He thought, but not for long, of soldiers and sailors, whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs, ending their days in some pauper ward, and of cardinal Wolsey's words: If I had served my God as I have served my king He would not have abandoned me in my old days.\" Having abandoned the sailor, Conmee chats up the wife of an M.P. with talk of houses and vacation spots, \"And smiled yet again, in going. He had cleaned his teeth, he knew, with arecanut paste.\" He spots another rich matron, salutes her, and admires her aristocratic bearing: \"A fine carriage she had. Like Mary, queen of Scots, something. And to think that she was a pawnbroker! Well, now! Such a... what should he say?... such a queenly mien.\"\n Conmee's infatuation with the upper crust reappears near the end of his section, when his walk along the Malahide road makes him think of the Talbot family that lived in the Malahide castle. He recalls spectacular incidents from that and other noble families and thinks fondly of \"old times in the barony.\" He imagines himself the priest to an old aristocratic family: \"Don John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore. He was humane and honoured there. He bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at smiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom, ceiled with full fruit clusters. And the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom, noble to noble, were impalmed by Don John Conmee.\" The mock-aristocratic title sticks to him, returning in the Circe passage quoted above. \n The flip side of Conmee's love of economic privilege is his indifference to poverty, justified by an assumption that God must have intended for some people to own less than others. In some of the most scathingly ironic writing that Joyce ever allowed himself, the sight of a dirty bargeman sitting with his pile of turf on the Royal Canal sends him into a rhapsodic appreciation of nature: \"It was idyllic: and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of the Creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor people.\" Disliking dirt himself, Father Conmee boards a tram so as not \"to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island,\" and, having paid the fare, deplores \"The solemnity of the occupants of the car,\" which \"seemed to Father Conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap. Father Conmee liked cheerful decorum.\" An old woman gets off, and he thinks, \"as she had nearly passed the end of the penny fare, she was one of those good souls who had always to be told twice bless you, my child, that they have been absolved, pray for me. But they had so many worries in life, so many cares, poor creatures.\"\n Equally appalling is Conmee's indifference to physical suffering. His lack of empathy for the sailor's amputation (poor man, he should have chosen a career in religion) proves to be only a warmup for the newspapers' announcement of \"a dreadful catastrophe in New York. In America those things were continually happening. Unfortunate people to die like that, unprepared. Still, an act of perfect contrition.\" Most human beings on the planet are guilty of shutting down empathic response to distant disasters: there is more than enough pull on one's heartstrings close to home, and in Somalia, or Afghanistan, or El Salvador, such things are continually happening. But Father Conmee takes such moral shrugging to a new level by thinking how \"Unfortunate\" it is that the more than 1,000 women and children burned, drowned, or crushed on New York's East River have been condemned to an eternity in Hell by their failure to receive the last rites of the Catholic church. \n In its holy wisdom, Mother Church has responded to the existence of such distressing situations by promulgating the doctrine of \"perfect contrition.\" No priest nearby as you're burning to death? Take a few quiet moments to feel total remorse for every sinful thing you've done in your sorry life, the church promises, and we'll give you a one-time exemption. The kicker in Conmee's absurd \"Still...\" is that the women and children in New York were German Protestants. They were doomed to an eternity in Hell anyway, their final prayers useless.\n On yet another topic, the church's missionary outreach to people in non-Christian parts of the world, Father Conmee appears to somewhat better effect. It is a topic of keen interest to him. When Bloom steps into St. Andrew's church inLotus Eaters he sees \"Same notice on the door. Sermon by the very reverend John Conmee S.J. on saint Peter Claver and the African Mission. Save China's millions.\" Peter Claver was a 17th century Spanish Jesuit missionary who worked for nearly half a century in Cartagena, Colombia, ministering to the black slaves that the Spaniards were bringing to the New World, and Conmee is now promoting the cause of missions in Africa and China. The moral record of such missions is of course rife with instances of brutality and cultural imperialism, but Conmee's \"Father Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and of his sermon on saint Peter Claver S.J. and the African mission and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their last hour came like a thief in the night.\"\n A prosecutor at Heaven's gate might add several more small items to the list of indictments, but this is enough for one note, and there \n looks condescendingly at those of other faiths, \n Sin and sex. \n Thoughts about the Jesuit missions run through Conmee's mind in Wandering Rocks when he catches sight of the Negro impersonator Eugene Stratton: \n Once again, Jesuit reasoning comes into play: \"That book by the Belgian jesuit, Le Nombre des Élus, seemed to Father Conmee a reasonable plea. Those were millions of human souls created by God in His Own likeness to whom the faith had not (D.V.) been brought. But they were God's souls, created by God.\" Father Auguste Castelain's Le Rigorisme, le nombre des élus et la doctrine du salut (Brussels, 1899) opposes \"Rigorism\", the orthodox doctrine that only baptized Catholics could achieve salvation (salut), arguing that the number of those chosen by God (le nombre des élus) will in fact be far higher than the numbers of damned souls. The fact that Conmee approves of this liberal theory of salvation tempers the sarcastic light cast on his patronizing attitude toward all non-Catholics: \"It seemed to Father Conmee a pity that they should all be lost, a waste, if one might say.\"\n Since Joyce was never intimately acquainted with the much older Conmee, it seems possible that the unsavory qualities he attached to his fictional avatar were intended less as an indictment of a particular individual than as a representative portrait of one of the local princes of the Catholic church. \n Probably Joyce's response to the priesthood in general more than any personal antipathy to John Conmee. \"Virtuous: but occasionally they were also badtempered.\" (Bloomlike) The same could be said more generally of the portrait that Joyce created in Wandering Rocks. For all of its snide irreverence, Joyce did include many details bearing out his view that Conmee was, as he remarked to Herbert Gorman, \"a very decent sort of chap.\""

    "expandedNote": " Gareth Collins summarizes the friar's social significance: \"Fr Theobald \n Mathew (1790-1856) was a Cork-based Capuchin friar, born in County Tipperary, who led a great temperance movement from 1839 to1856. His anti-drink campaign is considered to have been a great social revolution that saw the establishment of Temperance Societies in every parish in the country. At its peak between 1838-1845, it was estimated that there were 3-4 million abstaining from drink in Ireland. This high number was aided by the fact that Fr Mathew appealed to every class and rank in society. In 1843, Fr Mathew went to England and Scotland where he had further success, and later spent over two years in the US where he gave the pledge in over 300 towns. He's also famous for his work during the cholera epidemic of 1832 and The Great Famine. The statue was erected in 1891 by sculptor Mary Redmond.\"\n Echoes of the temperance movement sound throughout Ulysses—not surprising when one considers that more than half the population of Ireland took Father Mathew's \"pledge\" to abstain from drink in the 1840s, and people were still taking it in 1904. When Gerty MacDowell thinks of her father's ruinous alcoholism, she wishes that he might have taken the pledge: \"Had her father only avoided the clutches of the demon drink, by taking the pledge or those powders the drink habit cured in Pearson's Weekly, she might now be rolling in her carriage, second to none.\" People who took the pledge were expected to adhere to it for life, by a commitment of will as absolute as marriage vows.\n The pledge movement began in Cork with the establishment of the Cork Total Abstinence Society in 1838. Another statue to Father Mathew's memory stands in Cork, on St. Patrick's Street. It was erected in 1864.\n Father Mathew's statue is the last of the monuments to great men that the funeral carriages pass by in Hades. Later in the day, Blazes Boylan retraces part of the path followed by the cortège, traveling north from the quays along Sackville Street in a jaunting car toward the Blooms' house. Sirens mentions his passing many of the same urban landmarks passed by Bloom in the morning: Gray's statue, Nelson's pillar, Elvery's, Father Mathew, the Rotunda."

Apparently May has held onto some she possessed in her gay days before starting a family. Other chapters of the novel reflect the Victorian and Edwardian rage for attaching feathers or even entire wings of birds to hats, which by 1904 was becoming controversial.",
    "expandedNote": " Hats adorned simply with a single feather had existed for a long time, as in the Alpine apparel featured in Circe when Bello appears \"in mountaineer’s puttees, green silverbuttoned coat, sport skirt and alpine hat with moorcock’s feather.\" But Victorian fashionistas created an appetite for much showier displays, some of them much larger than the heads they topped. When Molly thinks in Penelope of being in a rowboat off Bray with Bloom, and \"the hat I had with that feather all blowy and tossed on me how annoying and provoking,\" she is without doubt recalling something glamorous and unsuited to high winds. Birds' feathers, and sometimes even entire birds, were also wired to ladies' evening dresses and to fans whose colors complemented the dresses. By the turn of the century \"feather fans\" had largely disappeared, but hatmakers still depended on a supply of exotic bird parts from all over the globe. \n Many people protested the cruelty of killing beautiful birds for the sake of female vanity, as Joyce was well aware. In Circe, Leopold Bloom, who is normally acutely sensitive to animal cruelty, becomes so caught up in flirting with Josie Breen that he can joke about the beautiful bird’s wing that she once wore on a hat:\n BLOOM\n . . . you were in your heyday then and you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I’ll lay you what you like she did it on purpose . . .\n MRS BREEN\n She did, of course, the cat!

By 1904 the Society had heightened awareness of the problem among society women in Boston, started movements toward state and national legislation, and established the first Federal Bird Reservation, the beginning of the National Wildlife Refuge System. \n The story in the United Kingdom was much the same. The Sea Birds Preservation Act of 1869 was the first British law to protect wild birds, though Parliament did it to protect sailors from shipwreck more than the birds themselves. In 1889 Emily Williamson of Manchester founded a group called the Plumage League specifically to protest the use of feathers in women's hats. In 1899 the women of her group joined with another such group to create the national organization called the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. The RSPB pursued tactics much like those of the Audubon Society: conversion of promiment society ladies, obtaining a royal charter, petitioning Parliament for laws banning the use of feathers by the fashion industry, and founding wildlife reserves."

Revolutionary uprisings broke out across Europe in 1848—Paris, Berlin, Vienna, Prague, Budapest, Rome—and the Young Irelanders joined the fray. James Stephens played a role in their 1848 attack on a police garrison in County Tipperary.\n After the failed 1848 rebellion, Stephens and a man named John O'Mahony fled to Paris. O'Mahony eventually emigrated to New York City, where in 1858 he founded an Irish republican organization inspired by the ancient Fianna, small bands of legendary Irish warriors who lived apart from society, described in the Fenian Cycle as followers of Finn McCool (Fionn mac Cumhaill). Stephens returned to Ireland, and at about the same time he founded the Irish Republican Brotherhood or Irish Revolutionary Brotherhood (IRB) in Dublin. The Fenians contributed volunteers to the IRB and followed its dictates, and the two groups were often referred to as one. \n Together, they planned a Fenian Rising, drawing on Irish-American soldiers discharged from the armies of the American Civil War and Irish soldiers who would mutiny from within the ranks of the British Army and take over the many military barracks around Dublin. But the IRB was infiltrated by British informers, and many of its leaders were arrested in 1865. The insurrection was poorly planned; soon after it began in early 1867 it was suppressed and more leaders were arrested. \n Afterward, small Fenian groups attempted to free imprisoned leaders in England, first (in September 1867) through an attack on a van carrying prisoners in Manchester, and then (in December) through the demolition by gunpowder of a wall of London's Clerkenwell Prison. One guard was killed in the van; the prison bombing killed 12 people and injured many dozens more. Four Fenians were executed for their roles in the two attacks. \n Richard O'Sullivan Burke was one of the American Fenians, a former colonel in the United States Army. Gifford notes that he participated in the raid on the prison van, that he was arrested soon after, and that \"he was among the Fenian leaders who were supposed to have been freed by the abortive gunpowder plot against Clerkenwell Prison.\" Joseph Casey was with Burke inside Clerkenwell at the time of the bombing. In Proteus Stephen imagines how \"he prowled with colonel Richard Burke, tanist of his sept, under the walls of Clerkenwell and, crouching, saw a flame of vengeance hurl them upward in the fog.\" The plan was to blow up the wall of the prison's exercise yard while Burke and Casey huddled \"crouching\" against its base; but as Gifford notes, \"the prison authorities, warned by informers that a rescue was to be attempted, changed Burke and Casey's exercise time and thus foiled the plot.\" \n Septs, in ancient and medieval Ireland (and Scotland), were subclans. Gifford observes that, \"Among the ancient Irish, a tanist was the heir apparent to the tribal chief, elected during the chief's lifetime. The implication here is that Burke was to be James Stephen's successor as Head Centre.\" \n Egan's narration to Stephen of \"how the head centre got away\" introduces another strand of the Fenian story into the novel, this one from late 1866 and early 1867. James Stephens was betrayed by a spy, arrested, and convicted, but sympathizers within Dublin's Richmond Gaol effected his escape (in Lestrygonians, Bloom thinks it was the \"Turnkey's daughter\"). After a few months of hiding out in Dublin (Bloom thinks it was \"in the Buckingham Palace hotel under their very noses\") he made his way to the coast via \"the road to Malahide,\" shipped over to America, and became Head Centre of the NYC organization. His opponents in the IRB circulated what Gifford calls \"the apocryphal (and denigrating) story\" that Stephens made his escape \"Got up as a young bride, man, veil, orangeblossoms.\" His transformation into a woman suits the shapeshifting theme of Proteus.\n Fantastic rumors about the people who effected Stephens' escape pervade the novel. In Calypso Bloom thinks of going to the Turkish baths: \"Wonder have I time for a bath this morning. Tara street. Chap in the paybox there got away James Stephens, they say.\" In Cyclops Joe Hynes declares that the Citizen is \"The man that got away James Stephens.\" As Bloom is being apotheosized as a civic hero in Circe, John Wyse Nolan proclaims the same distinction for Bloom: \"There's the man that got away James Stephens.\" (A schoolboy yells \"Bravo!\" and an old man says, \"You're a credit to your country, sir, that's what you are.\")"

  "020036filibegs": {
    "note": " Mr. Deasy's mantelpiece in Nestor boasts a picture of \"the shapely bulk of a man in tartan filibegs: Albert Edward, prince of Wales.\" Filibeg transliterates the Scots Gaelic féileadhbeag, from the words féileadh (kilt) and beag (small). The Prince of Wales, who became King Edward VII in 1901 (though his coronation occurred in 1902), often dressed in such a get-up.",
    "expandedNote": " What hangs over Deasy's mantel is most likely a photographic image, since many photographs were taken of this royal personage in Highlands garb, and art prints of them were sold widely. Edward's dress conformed to a tradition that began when King George IV became the first Hanoverian monarch of Great Britain to visit Scotland. The visit had been encouraged by Sir Walter Scott, who oversaw elaborate preparations that included thousands of Lowlanders outfitted in Highland dress. \n In How the Scots Invented the Modern World (2001), Arthur Herman notes that the king had said, \"I dislike seeing anything in Scotland that is not purely national and characteristic\" (312). In 1822 that meant clothes, weapons, and bagpipes consistent with the romantic depictions of Highland life in Scott's novels. When the king arrived in Edinburgh his flabby body was stuffed into the full outfit: a kilt in the Royal Stewart tartan plaid with a sporran pouch in front, flesh-colored plaid tights, the green sash of the Order of the Thistle, and a bonnet with a jaunty feather.\n Actual Highlanders usually wore the voluminous breacan an féileadh or great kilt which wrapped around the entire body, keeping people warm in the harsh climate. The Edinburgh organizers opted instead for the sportier féileadh-beag,which covered only the upper legs and sometimes attached a short piece of plaid at one shoulder. The king's visit made \"filibegs\" the expected thing in the popular imagination. \n Something similar happened with plaid patterns. Most Highlanders had never associated a particular tartan with their clan; they wore whatever cloth was available, and expressed their clan allegiance in battle with things like a sprig of heather, thistle, or juniper. In the 18th century Highlander regiments in the British army had opted for more regularity, and after the king's visit in the 1820s people in both the Highlands and the Lowlands became convinced that they must have tartans that declared their familial descent. The rest is familiar, and almost entirely bogus, history.\n When Prince Albert purchased the Balmoral estate in Aberdeenshire in 1852, Queen Victoria decided that the royal family must wear tartan plaids whenever they retreated to Scotland. Her son Bertie became one more fat Hanoverian stuffed into a Highland warrior's kit."

    "note": " The \"Adam Findlaters or Dan Tallons\" that Bloom imagines his country curates blossoming into were purveyors of alcohol whose considerable business success prompted aspirations to join the ruling class. But Findlater's was certainly not a rags-to-riches story, and there is no evidence that Tallon's was either.",
    "expandedNote": " Adam S. Findlater (1855-1911) managed Alexander Findlater & Co., Ltd., a booming business in tea, wine, and spirits that was founded in 1823 by his uncle Alexander, an enterprising Scotsman. The main store was on Sackville (now O'Connell) Street, but there were branch offices scattered throughout the city and the surrounding county. The excellent family website at www.findlaterbook.com devotes a chapter to Adam, who was educated at Trinity College (B.A. 1876, M.A. 1889) while working in the family business. As managing director he brought considerable learning and skill to the management of the firm, overseeing steady growth. He also had ownership stakes and management responsibilities in Dublin hotels, theaters, and distilleries. \n In addition to some notable charitable enterprises, Findlater was deeply involved in local politics. He served on the Dublin Port and Docks Board and the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, and chaired the town commission of Kingstown at a time when that rich suburb undertook many civic improvements. When the gathering strength of the Home Rule movement in the 1880s prompted conservative business people to organize politically as unionists, Findlater became an articulate proponent of liberal unionist causes, advocating reforms that moderate nationalists might agree upon. Thornton notes that the United Irishman, Arthur Griffith's newspaper, characterized Findlater as \"kowtowing to the English in hope of some preferment,\" encouraging \"foreign manufacture in Ireland,\" and \"begging for a knighthood.\"\n Daniel Tallon was a man of more pronounced nationalist sympathies, and probably of somewhat humbler origins. Gifford identifies him as \"A successful publican\" and as a \"grocer and wine merchant\" at 46 George's Street South and 57 Stephen Street. Tallon became High Sheriff of Dublin in 1895 and was the Lord Mayor from 1898 to 1900. He too was involved in significant charitable and philanthropic enterprises. Bloom thinks of his lord-mayorship in Ithaca."

    "note": " The \"fine old custom\" that Simon Dedalus is glad to see \"has not died out\" is the one that he and his companions are observing in Hades: riding through the center of town in horse-drawn carriages to attend a funeral. Later during the ride to Glasnevin, Bloom suggests that it might be desirable to replace equine transport with electric trams, a modern innovation that was catching on in cities throughout Europe and North America. The idea was never adopted in Dublin.",
    "expandedNote": " Slote notes that \"The custom is that a funeral procession will take a route through the centre of the city, thereby giving many a chance to pay their last respects. On any given day, several different funeral processions would run through the city. This custom has since died out.\" The tradition of the funeral cortège is very ancient, dating back at least to the time of the Roman empire. In the late 19th century and the early years of the 20th, hearses bearing the deceased and other vehicles carrying mourners were commonly drawn by horses, but new mechanized modes of transport were quickly making this practice obsolete. Automobiles were first used in an American funeral procession in 1909. Several years later Lyle Abbot, the automobile editor of the Arizona Republican, coined the term \"motorcade,\" and where the tradition survives today it usually takes this form. \n But automobiles were rare at the time represented in the novel (only one appears in all the pages of Ulysses), while many North American and European cities had tram (streetcar) systems. Mexico City and Milan introduced dedicated funeral trams in the 1880s—horse-drawn at first, it seems, but soon electric—and by the end of the century countless large cities had followed suit. Although Dubliners were justifiably proud of their new electric tram system, their city was behind the times on this count. \n As the funeral procession slowly picks its way through a herd of lowing cattle, Bloom remarks to his fellow riders, \"I can't make out why the corporation doesn't run a tramline from the parkgate to the quays . . . All those animals could be taken in trucks down to the boats.\" Martin Cunningham responds favorably: \"Instead of blocking up the thoroughfare . . . Quite right. They ought to.\" But then Bloom volunteers his related idea \"to have municipal funeral trams like they have in Milan, you know. Run the line out to the cemetery gates and have special trams, hearse and carriage and all.\" His proposal initially meets with derision, but practical considerations soon prompt a more serious reception.\n Martin Cunningham recalls, and Mr. Power remembers, an occasion when a hearse overturned rounding the sharp turn at Dunphy's Corner, spilling a corpse onto the roadway. Such incidents have not remained confined to olden times. In 2008 mourners were horrified when the horse-drawn hearse bearing the remains of Caroline Thompson through the streets of Ipswich, England suffered a similar accident. Two of the four horses bolted after the driver performed an evasive maneuver and hit a street bollard. The carriage slammed into automobiles and overturned, the horses ran away in terror, the coffin slid onto the street, and the funeral was delayed for an hour."

    "note": " The \"Fitzgeralds,\" or \"Geraldines,\" were powerful Anglo-Irish lords in counties Offaly and Kildare, west of Dublin. Characters in Ulysses refer often to the 10th Earl of Kildare, Silken Thomas, who mounted a rebellion against the English king. But Thomas' grandfather, the so-called Great Earl, also mentioned in Wandering Rocks, was a more formidable leader.",
    "expandedNote": " The 8th Earl of Kildare, Gerald FitzGerald (Gearoid Mór FitzGerald), often called The Great Earl (An Iarla Mór) or \"the uncrowned King of Ireland,\" served as Lord Deputy of Ireland for the Yorks and Tudors during most of the years from 1477 to 1513. His son, also named Gerald, was the 9th Earl of Kildare from 1513 to 1534, and his grandson Thomas succeeded his father in 1534. \n In Wandering Rocks Ned Lambert tells J. J. O'Molloy that the reverend Hugh C. Love is \"writing a book about the Fitzgeralds.\" He kicks himself for not having told the clergyman a good one about The Great Earl: \"—God! he cried. I forgot to tell him that one about the earl of Kildare after he set fire to Cashel cathedral. You know that one? I'm bloody sorry I did it, says he, but I declare to God I thought the archbishop was inside. He mightn't like it, though. What? God, I'll tell him anyhow. That was the great earl, the Fitzgerald Mor. Hot members they were all of them, the Geraldines.\"\n The Great Earl was a force to be reckoned with. Despite his involvement in the Lambert Simnel conspiracy in 1487, Henry VII kept him on as Lord Deputy until 1494, when he removed him and had him imprisoned in the Tower of London. At trial in 1496, however, FitzGerald convinced the king that the alternatives to his rule were much worse. Henry is reported to have said, \"All Ireland cannot govern this Earl; then let this Earl govern all Ireland.\""

  "010124fivefathoms": {
    "note": " A fathom is six feet, so the boatman who says in Telemachus that \"There's five fathoms out there\" is indicating thirty feet of water in the outer reaches of Dublin Bay where it gives way to open ocean. (Thornton observes, \"I have seen several maps of the Dublin Bay area which include a 'Five Fathom Line.'\") Somewhere out there the body of “The man that was drowned” on June 7 is being pushed about by the currents and swelling up with gas, and folk wisdom holds that it will surface in “nine days.” Within these realistic details lurks an allusion to Shakespeare's The Tempest that raises metaphysical questions about life after death.",
    "expandedNote": " The depth of the sounding and the fact that a dead body is washing about in those thirty feet of seawater invite readers to hear the strains of the song that Ariel sings to Ferdinand, who is stumbling about the island mourning a father who has died in a shipwreck:\n Full fathom five thy father lies,\n Of his bones are coral made:\n Those are pearls that were his eyes:\n Nothing of him that doth fade,\n But doth suffer a sea-change\n Into something rich and strange. \n The song implies a reconstitution on the other side of death, possibly Christian but more likely not: Ariel sings not of God saving Alonso’s soul but of the sea making something beautiful of his drowned body. However one may read Shakespeare’s powerfully visual and aural image of humanity becoming transformed into “something rich and strange,” the effect is certainly to evoke a mysterious reality on the other side of death.\nAriel sings the song to assuage Ferdinand’s grief, to assure him that he lives in a beneficent universe, and to free him to love the young woman whom he is about to meet. These characteristics of Ferdinand’s situation seem peculiarly relevant to Stephen, who is haunted and accused by his mother's death, convinced that he lives in a malignant universe, and eager to discover love. \n In Proteus Stephen recalls the boatman’s words fromTelemachus and makes the implicit allusion explicit: “Five fathoms out there. Full fathom five thy father lies.” As his thoughts continue to play over the boatman’s words (“At one, he said. Found drowned. High water at Dublin bar”), he imagines the “Bag of corpsegas” becoming transformed, not into a celestial spirit, but into all the multifarious forms of physical existence: “God becomes man becomes fish becomes barnacle goose becomes featherbed mountain.” This shifting of corporeal shapes through decomposition and reintegration resembles Shakespeare's \"sea-change\" by which Alonso's eyes become pearls and his bones coral: \"A seachange this, brown eyes saltblue.\""

  "010152linkedarm": {
    "note": " At several points in the novel, men reach out to Stephen in efforts to guide him—often literally, with a physical touch. In his obvious brilliance and obvious lostness Stephen attracts paternal feelings, and in this epic of the human body that need for human connection often registers in touch, just as it does in Stephen's need for a heterosexual relationship. But not all of these overtures are welcome.",
    "expandedNote": " In Proteus, Stephen imagines meeting a woman who can rescue him from his loneliness: \"Touch me. Soft eyes. Soft soft soft hand. I am lonely here. O, touch me soon, now. What is that word known to all men? I am quiet here alone. Sad too. Touch, touch me.\" When Nora Barnacle rescued James Joyce on the same Sandymount Strand, she touched him. Several men indulge that impulse, although not sexually.\n Mulligan purports to offer Stephen intimate friendship, an intention which is borne out by his locking arms with Stephen in Telemachus and holding on to him for a prolonged time. We hear that \"Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen's and walked with him round the tower.\" Fully a page later (after twelve paragraphs), \"Stephen freed his arm quietly.\" The verb \"freed,\" and Stephen's memory of Cranly while Mulligan is holding his arm—\"Cranly's arm. His arm\"—suggest an aversive response. Stephen's reasons for recoiling from the touch are many. He distrusts Mulligan's efforts to become a mentor: \"I'm the only one that knows what you are. Why don't you trust me more?\" He also seems to feel that Mulligan's impulse to take charge of his life conceals a predatory sexuality. In Scylla and Charybdis, after Mulligan rhapsodizes about \"the charge of pederasty brought against the bard,\" he thinks, \"Catamite.\"\n In Nestor the old headmaster Mr. Deasy never touches his employee (although he does come running after him down the front path), but he brims with presumptuous advice that Stephen clearly has no intention of following. The pattern is repeated in Aeolus when the newspaper editor Myles Crawford lays “a nervous hand on Stephen’s shoulder”—nervous because he wants to recruit him to write for the paper. Like Mulligan, Crawford presumes to understand the reserved young writer: “You can do it. I see it in your face.” But his presumption prompts a hostile response from Stephen, who links Crawford with Father Dolan, the demented Jesuit disciplinarian who punished him unjustly in A Portrait: “See it in your face. See it in your eye. Lazy idle little schemer.”\n By contrast, two men’s touches do not provoke Stephen’s hostility. One comes from Almidano Artifoni, his Italian teacher, in Wandering Rocks. Artifoni, like Mulligan and Crawford, presumes to understand Stephen in this scene: he is wasting his singing talent, he says, when he could be earning some money from it. Stephen listens sympathetically to his advice, and is rewarded with a handshake: \"His heavy hand took Stephen's firmly. Human eyes. They gazed curiously an instant and turned quickly towards a Dalkey tram.\" \n In Eumaeus, Leopold Bloom, who has the same advice to offer about Stephen's talent as a singer, invites the battered young man to lean on him during their walk to Bloom's house. “— Yes, Stephen said uncertainly, because he thought he felt a strange kind of flesh of a different man approach him, sinewless and wobbly and all that.\""

  "030134fleshpots": {
    "note": " Both Stephen and Bloom think of a biblical phrase, \"fleshpots of Egypt,\" that evokes life in exile. It is used by the Israelites when they rebel against Moses, who has led them out of captivity in Egypt into near-starvation in the Sinai desert.",
    "expandedNote": " In \"the fifteenth day of the second month\" after leaving Egypt, \"the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness: And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger\" (Exodus 16:1-3). YHWH responds by promising to \"rain bread from heaven\" (16:4), \"And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host\" (16:13). The quail meat and the manna rescue the people from starvation. \n Stephen apparently thinks of this episode in Proteus with a wry, sardonic twist. He has escaped from Ireland, only to face near-starvation in Paris. What does he find to eat there? Not elegant quail or miraculous manna but only \"fleshpots\" of the lowest order: \"mou en civet\" is lung stew. \n Bloom too does something surprising with the image. He thinks of a man named Jack Fleming who ran off to America and \"Keeps a hotel now. They never come back. Fleshpots of Egypt.\" In this instance, the better economic circumstances in America, imaged as fleshpots, keep Ireland's exiles from returning. Material fulfillment wins out over spiritual calling."

  "050008floatingflower": {
    "note": " Bloom thinks of his penis, \"the limp father of thousands,\" as “a languid floating flower.” The image of a flower floating on the water evokes the plant that gives its name to this episode: Lotus Eaters. But the negative implication of the Homeric parallel (human rationality plunged into drugged stupor) seems to be balanced here by a positive suggestion (spiritual fulfillment arising from the depths of material embodiment).",
    "expandedNote": " No scholarly consensus has been reached regarding the precise identity of the Homeric plant consumed by the Lotus-eaters for food and pleasure. The Ziziphus lotus is the most common association, but the blue lotus, an Egyptian water lily related to the lotus common to Asian culture and myth, and which contains psychotropic properties, is another contender. Bloom has thought of water lilies at the beginning of the episode: \"Hothouse in Botanic gardens. Sensitive plants. Waterlilies. Petals too tired to. Sleeping sickness in the air.\"\n In Asian religions, particularly Buddhism, the lotus flower is a versatile symbol, most apparently for rising above the murk and confusion of material reality ruled by fear and desire into spiritual enlightenment. The lotus, rooted in the mud while floating cleanly on the water’s surface, symbolizes the relationship between the carnal and the divine. It seems that Joyce may be drawing on this familiar symbolism, since Bloom's imagination of what his naked body will look like stretched out in the bath is sparked by thinking, \"This is my body.\" His phrase echoes Christ's words at the Last Supper, used in the sacrament of Communion to announce the miracle of transubstantiation. The Eucharist is emblematic of matter becoming infused with spirit, and symbolic of the greater miracle of Incarnation: the divine Word becoming flesh in the human person of Jesus. \n Bloom's thoughts of his corpse submerged within the deeply spiritual symbol of water emphasize that mental and spiritual influences, far from possessing anything like independent substantial realities, must reside as some aspect of materiality. Throughout Ulysses, Joyce seems to refuse to take sides in the battle between mind and matter, letting his two main characters represent the value in each: Stephen as a champion of reason and intellect and Bloom as a man of sensory aesthetics and lusty appetites. In Lotus Eaters Bloom champions Joyce’s middle-path immanentist ontology through an enhanced materialism that has no use for religion or spiritualism, but which is nevertheless overflowing with curiosity, mystical speculation, and an emphasis on the imaginative aspect of experience. From this visionary bath scene arises the co-reliance between mind and matter. \n Just before thinking of the bath, Bloom has meditated on transience: \"Won't last. Always passing, the stream of life, which in the stream of life we trace is dearer than them all.\" He superimposes this image on the bath: \"clean trough of water, cool enamel, the gentle tepid stream. This is my body.\" The body floating on the stream is a transient phenomenon, but it cheats death by procreating itself. The penis/lotus' thread from airy surface to soiled roots becomes a kind of highway driving souls from body to body, connecting unborn thousands to their limp father in an endless chain of umbilical cords and transmigrations. The paradox is that this eternal thread of transmigration can be sustained only via unsustainable corporeal reality. \n Bloom’s “limp father of thousands” becomes an emphatic image for reverse engineering spiritual dualism to demonstrate the soul’s total dependence upon the physical. Because he is so comfortable in his own body he focuses on the ways spiritual and material realities are inextricably connected, and suggests a single substance ontology giving rise to the illusion of duality through a relationship with itself (through the mediums of space and/or time). In such a system the spiritual is merely a dynamic of physical processes. Without the birth and dissolution of material bodies that \"won’t last,\" and are \"always passing,\" there can be no eternal/spiritual reality. From Christ to Zeus, even gods betray a pathological desperation to inhabit a vessel. Aristotle’s forms are always abstractions from the particular. And a disembodied soul is deader than a corpse."

    "expandedNote": " The original version of this sentimental ballad consisted of two stanzas and a chorus, one stanza of which can be heard in the 1905 recording at right. (The harmony voice, regrettably, overwhelms the melody line.) The lyrics below are reproduced from a copy of the Jos. W. Stern & Co. sheet music held in the Library of Congress.\n Last night I dreamed a sweet, sweet dream;\n I thought I saw my home, sweet home, \n And oh! how grand it all did seem, \n I made a vow no more to roam.\n By the dear old village church I strolled,\n While the bell in the steeple sadly tolled\n I saw my daddy old and gray,\nI heard my dear old mother say;\n (Chorus)\n You're as welcome as the flowers in May,\n And we love you in the same old way;\n We've been waiting for you day by day, \n You're as welcome as the flowers in May.\n I dreamed I saw my sweetheart Bess,\n And once again we pledged our love;\n I listened to her low sweet \"yes,\"\n The moon was shining from above;\n Then we talked of happy days of yore,\n And the day that I left my home heartsore;\n My thoughts are many miles away,\n I long to hear my sweetheart say;\n (Chorus) \n The song has enjoyed popularity both in Ireland and in the U.S., where it became a staple of country music. At some point the country version underwent significant changes: the stanzas were shortened by two lines, two additional stanzas were added (at least they are not present in the older sheet music I have been able to locate), and the melody was altered. Many Irish performers have sung this version, as in the performance at right by Mick Foster and Tony Allen, two Irish artists from County Kildare and County Westmeath respectively.\n Might Joyce have alluded to this song, in part, because of the low sweet \"Yes\" (changed to \"voice\" in the country version) that the singer has received from his sweetheart?"

    "note": " Kevin Egan lives in a poor but vital part of Paris: \"the Montmartre lair he sleeps short night in, rue de la Goutte-d'Or, damascened with flyblown faces of the gone.\" Ellmann confirms that Joseph Casey, the model for Egan, did live on that street in Montmartre (125). The rest of Stephen's sentence could possibly be describing people on the street, but it seems far more likely to refer to images of Fenian compatriots on the walls of Egan's dilapidated flat.",
    "expandedNote": " Montmartre is a hill in the 18th arrondissement of Paris, and also the district surrounding that hill, on the Right Bank in the northern part of the city. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries many painters (Monet, Degas, Modigliani, Van Gogh, Picasso, Toulouse-Lautrec, Renoir, Mondrian) lived or had studios there, drawn by inexpensive housing, a Bohemian population, and a village-like atmosphere. The \"rue de la Goutte-d'Or\" (Street of the Golden Drop), Gifford notes, \"was named for the golden wine from long-since displaced vineyards.\" In fact the vineyards were not all displaced: a small one, the Clos Montmartre, remains even today, now owned by the City of Paris. \n Stephen's word for Egan's place of residence, \"lair,\" suggests some very dismal housing. No doubt there was plenty of it at the time, but it is worth asking whether he is thinking of living conditions in a certain section of Paris or the living habits of a certain depressed Irish exile. The resolution of this ambiguity will influence one's reading of \"damascenedwith flyblown faces of the gone.\" \n Attaching this participial phrase to the Goutte d'Or, Gifford infers that Stephen is thinking of characters who live on or near it in the naturalistic novels of Émile Zola, which depicted the lives of poor people in all their sordid bleakness: \"Gervaise Macquart, the protagonist of L'assommoir (The Grog Shop or Gin Mill) (1877), lives in what Zola calls the quartier de la Goutte d'Or and, with her husband, declines into derelection, filth, inanition, and finally death as a result of alcoholism.\" Her daughter \"Nana (Nana, 1880) is born and comes of age in the quartier; she is en route to supreme success as a grand cocotte (prostitute) when she meets a premature, and symbolic, death from small pox. The second to the last paragraph of Nana is a particularly vigorous description of the face of Nana's corpse, devastated by smallpox as though the 'virus' with which she had 'poisoned a people had mounted into her face and rotted it.'\"\n By Gifford's reading, Stephen is imagining the Goutte d'Or area \"damascened\" (damask is a heavy cloth textured with wavy patterns) by the rotted faces of these dead women from a time several decades earlier. Even for Stephen, this all seems uncommonly hallucinatory and difficult to visualize. And there are other problems. Would he ever think of fictional characters, no matter how deceased, as \"gone\"? And would he substitute for Zola's image of a face rotted out by virus a different image of flies depositing their eggs on that face?\n In a personal communication, Vincent Van Wyk offers a much more plausible reading: what is \"damascened with flyblown faces of the gone\" is not the street but Egan's lair. His walls have acquired a wavy texture from all the old, curling photographs and drawings of Fenian heroes that he has pinned on them, and either flies have had their way with the disintegrating paper, or, less likely, the images depict corpses whose faces have been attacked by maggots. In either version, this construction yields a more or less visualizable and realistic scene, and it places Stephen's thoughts just where they have remained throughout this section of Proteus, with Egan's continual, gloomy meditations on \"lost leaders, the betrayed, wild escapes. Disguises, clutched at, gone, not here.\""

  "160009flyingdutchmen": {
    "note": " Bloom's recollection of a performance of \"the Flying Dutchman, a stupendous success,\" adds one more narrative to the blizzard of seafaring tales in Eumaeus. Joyce loved Wagner's opera, echoing its story in all four of his prose fictions and in his play Exiles. The libretto has clear relevance to Bloom's status as a wandering Jew and also to his marital situation. But Wagner's Flying Dutchman may not be the one whose performance he recalls, probably from a production at the Gaiety Theatre in 1877. Details in Circesuggest that he is remembering a more popular English musical play that associated the phantom ship of this name with industrialism. (In Nausicaa, Bloom also thinks ofphantom ships that appear at sea by a kind of \"optical illusion.\")",
    "expandedNote": " The Flying Dutchman is the mythic tale of a ghost ship that was eternally doomed to roam the seas after foundering in a gale off the Cape of Good Hope. The story was first recorded in print in the 1790s but it probably dates back to the 17th century era of Dutch maritime glory. In Scotsman John Howison's 1821 short story \"Vanderdecken's Message Home; or, the Tenacity of Natural Affection,\" a captain named Hendrick Vanderdecken refuses the chance to shelter in Cape Town's Table Bay after struggling all day to beat past strong contrary winds: \"May I be eternally damned if I do, though I should beat about here till the day of judgment.\" According to most versions of the story, sailors around the globe catch glimpses of the unlucky ship from time to time, and it is an ill omen. Countless short stories, novels, poems, stage plays, operas, songs, video games, and movies have drawn on this myth, from Coleridge's Rime of the Ancient Mariner to Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean. \n In 1840-41 Richard Wagner wrote the libretto and score of Der fliegende Holländer, which many lovers of his music, affirming the composer's own opinion, consider the first of his mature operas. Wagner was inspired by an 1834 Heinrich Heine tale which made the captain of the ship a kind of wandering Jew, cursed by the devil to sail the seas endlessly because he had committed blasphemy, but with the sarcastic proviso that he could be saved by the love of a faithful wife (an unlikely possibility, in the devil's view). Wagner made this challenge the motive of his plot. Some of the opera's action takes place in Norway, reflecting the impact of a difficult sea crossing that the composer made from Riga to London in 1839 with his wife Minna, in the course of which their ship sheltered from bad weather in a Norwegian fjord. \n In Wagner's libretto, a sea captain named Daland takes refuge from a storm in southern Norway. At night a ghostly vessel appears alongside his ship and grappling hooks bind the two vessels together. A pale black-bearded man, dressed all in black, comes aboard and tells Daland that he has been cursed to roam the sea forever, but that every seven years a heaven-sent wave casts him ashore, giving him a chance to find a woman who will be faithful to him and release him from the curse. Hearing that Daland has an unmarried daughter, he offers the captain treasure from his ship for her hand. Daland agrees, and the two set sail for Daland's home. \n There the daughter, Senta, has been gazing on a picture of the legendary Flying Dutchman and wishing that she could save him. She discards her former boyfriend Erik, and when her father arrives with her new betrothed she vows to be faithful to him to the point of death. But the Dutchman later overhears Erik complaining to Senta that she once swore to be true to him. This news fills the mariner with despair and he resolves to sail away once more. As his ship departs, Senta throws herself from a cliff, repeating her vow of fidelity until death. The curse is broken, the phantom ship disappears, and Senta and the Dutchman ascend to heaven. \n Thornton infers that when Bloom thinks of \"Ludwig, alias Ledwidge, when he occupied the boards of the Gaiety,\" he is recalling a performance of Wagner's The Flying Dutchman. It is tempting to assume that he is correct. Not only does this operatic fable offer clear parallels to the story of a Jew condemned to wander the earth eternally as punishment for some blasphemy against the Christian religion, but it also involves the wanderer in a domestic drama of sexual fidelity. The Dutchman's dependence on a woman for his salvation, and his uncertainty about whether he owns her heart given her connection to another man, would seem to make him a perfect analogue for Joyce's outcast protagonist—as useful as anything in Homer, Shakespeare, or Mozart. In The Case of Wagner, Friedrich Nietzsche laughed at the composer's reliance on this trope: \"Someone always wants to be saved in his operas . . . If it were not for Wagner, who would teach us . . . that even the eternal Jew gets saved andsettled down when he marries?\"\n In a well-researched article that quotes these sentences in a footnote, \"Joyce, Wagner, and the Wandering Jew,\" Comparative Literature 42.1 (1990): 49-72, Timothy P. Martin observes that Wagner saw himself as a Wandering Jew or Flying Dutchman seeking sexual and artistic homecoming, and that the young Joyce loved Wagner's mythmaking in general and the music of Der fliegende Holländer in particular. Martin notes many echoes of the opera's story in Joyce's works: in \"Eveline\" a sailor woos a domestic woman and a domestic woman waits for him; in A Portrait Stephen Dedalus is an exiled wanderer seeking redemption in the love of a woman; inExiles Robert Hand longs to fall from a high cliff into the sea and die in the arms of the woman he loves; in Proteusand Aeolus Stephen's vampire fantasy involves a deathly lover on a ghost ship coming to kiss a woman; in Eumaeus the long-exiled mariner drinks \"Holland gin\"; and in section II.3 of Finnegans Wake the tailor has a daughter whom the wandering Norwegian captain agrees to marry. Martin advances many other details in support of his claim. \n His wealth of evidence leaves little doubt that Joyce was thinking of Wagner's Flying Dutchman from early in his writing career until the end, but—alas for the search of tidy answers—it seems unlikely that Bloom could be thinking only or even primarily of this opera. Although it was one of only two or three Wagner works performed in Dublin before 1940, according to Martin, it seems unlikely that 19th century Dubliners would have made a \"stupendous success\" of such an avant-garde performance, and even more unlikely that Bloom in particular would get caught up in the enthusiasm. As he walks across Beresford Place discussing music with Stephen at the end of Eumaeus, the narrative makes clear that his tastes are less daring: \"Wagnerian music, though confessedly grand in its way, was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard to follow at the first go-off but the music of Mercadante's Huguenots, Meyerbeer's Seven Last Words on the Cross and Mozart's Twelfth Mass he simply revelled in.\" \n There is another, much more specific reason not to associate Wagner with the 1877 performance at the Gaiety: it apparently involved a captain named Vanderdecken, but Wagner never specifies the identity of his Flying Dutchman. Thornton quotes from an 1896 commemorative history of 25 years of the theater's productions: \"Ludwig was also in the Company, and the season was made memorable by his extraordinary and unsurpassed performance of 'Vanderdecken' in the 'Flying Dutchman,' with which his name has since become so inseparably identified.'\" This can hardly be a reference to Wagner's opera, since the name, which became common in English versions of the myth after Howison's story, does not appear in his libretto. \n Perhaps goaded by awareness that this name is absent from Der fliegende Holländer, Gifford notes that \"the opera with which Ludwig was most intimately identified was a musical version (by G. H. B. Rodwell) of Vanderdecken; or, The Flying Dutchman (1846), a popular play by the English playwright T. P. Taylor.\" His inference is strengthened by the fact that that name has showed up in the previous chapter of Ulysses. As he campaigns for high civic office in Circe, Bloom promises to build a tramline from the cattlemarket to the river, in contrast to certain eponymous capitalists: \"That's the music of the future. That's my programme. Cui bono?But our buccaneering Vanderdeckens in their phantom ship of finance . . . \" Wagner's music was often associated with the phrase \"music of the future\" or \"art of the future.\"Cui bono? means, To whose benefit (would this be)? So Bloom's plans may be Wagnerian in the sense that they will be good for the city. \n But buccaneering Vanderdeckens (who show up again in Finnegans Wake II.3 as \"bugganeering wanderducken\") are another matter. The name sends Bloom off ranting against industrialists in the manner of a Marxist labor organizer: \"These flying Dutchmen or lying Dutchmen as they recline in their upholstered poop, casting dice, what reck they? Machines is their cry, their chimera, their panacea. Laboursaving apparatuses, supplanters, bugbears, manufactured monsters for mutual murder, hideous hobgoblins produced by a horde of capitalistic lusts upon our prostituted labour.\"\n Bloom's strange reworking of the Flying Dutchman myth to include oppressive financiers and their sinister machines derives from a play on names. Gifford infers, and most later commentators concur, that Captain Vanderdecken here has merged with the fabulously wealthy Cornelius Vanderbilt, the 19th century American railroad magnate whose name became a byword for predatory capitalism as well as generous philanthropy. There is an uncanny rightness about the identification. Vanderbilt was descended from Dutch immigrants. He was called \"the Commodore\" for his fiercely competitive nature: his name, Gifford notes, \"together with that of his heirs, became a household word for the 'buccaneering' financier.\" And by an odd coincidence he died in the same year that Taylor's play was performed at the Gaiety, 1877. \n As the epithet suggests, swashbuckling mariners and rampaging captains of industry have something in common. The 1870 cartoon reproduced here depicts the rush to build railroads across the American continent as a thundering horse race, with the dashing Vanderbilt literally riding the rails by straddling two iron beasts. But the machines harnessed by his capitalistic lusts are steam locomotives, not ships. Could these iron horses of the prairie really equate to oceangoing vessels in Bloom's imagination? Well, yes, and for reasons that knowledge of the Tom Taylor play might elucidate. In Eumaeus, after thinking of Ludwig's acclaimed performance, Bloom muses on the unlikelihood of this theatrical production triumphing over its unwieldy setting: \"though ships of any sort, phantom or the reverse, on the stage usually fell a bit flat as also did trains.\"\n The second act of Tom Taylor's Vanderdecken takes place on the deck of a ship, and the first act explains Bloom's association of the Flying Dutchman with machines and captains of industry in a way that Wagner never could. The play opens in a Dutch shipbuilding town where the newly launched, \"entirely black\" Flying Dutchman lies at anchor, waiting on favorable winds to begin its maiden voyage. Several sailors sit drinking the health of Adrian Spiegelhalter, the rich capitalist who built the vessel: he has transformed their miserable little fishing village of Saardam into an industrial powerhouse, and his philanthrophy to the poor and the sick endears him to all. Spiegelhalter enters and sings the praises of the new ship: \"This beautiful vessel, built with every modern appliance, has also a peculiar mode of propulsion, possessing very important advantages, and will, if I am not greatly mistaken, prove herself the swiftest craft afloat. Her reputation is increasing daily in Holland, and even in mighty England, who has till now disputed with us the mastery of the main.\"\n The \"peculiar mode of propulsion\" is not identified, but it can only be steam engines driving screw propellers. Since the 1780s steam power had been successfully harnessed to river boats and canal boats outfitted with paddlewheels, and oceangoing paddlewheel steamships, invariably featuring sail-bearing masts as an alternate source of propulsion, appeared in the 1810s, becoming steadily more efficient in the 20s and 30s. Iron hulls were refined throughout this time, and in the late 1830s screw propellers arrived, with Francis Pettit Smith securing a patent in 1836 and fitting one to the seaworthy ship Archimedes in 1839. Other propeller-driven steamships were built in Britain and America from the mid-1840s onward. The SS Great Britain, pictured here from 1844, used a chain drive to connect a traditional paddlewheel engine to a propeller shaft housed in a stern tube passing through the hull. Taylor's play, written perhaps as early as 1844 and no later than 1846, almost certainly reflects the excitement of these new \"machines,\" whose conquest of the high seas endures today.\n Taylor's ship is \"overladen with sculpture\" and \"gaudy with paint and gold,\" which accords with Bloom's fancy of a luxurious \"ship of finance.\" Its \"high stern and poop elevated on poop,\" reminiscent of early 17th century vessels, may be responsible for his language of rich Dutchmen reclining on \"their upholstered poop.\" But beyond these pointed verbal similarities it becomes hard to imagine how the play's melodramatic story may have inspired Bloom's hostility to the Vanderdeckens of the world. It seems possible, but hardly conclusive, that he responded to the language of devilry that constantly attaches to the captain, Philip Vanderdecken. The man has a reputation for reckless courage that makes men fear him as if he were the devil, and he employs a sinister uncanny double named Schriften who abducts Spiegelhalter's daughter Estelle, breaking the marriage contract that her father has arranged with another man. The ship's sudden, unauthorized departure from Saardam with a drugged Estelle on board perhaps contributes to Bloom's language of \"lusts\" and \"prostituted labour.\" \n The third act redeems Vanderdecken. After he and Estelle survive the wreck of the Flying Dutchman off the Cape, he tells her that he had nothing to do with abducting her, she casts off her arranged engagement, and the two agree to marry. A priest is sent for, but he pulls back his cowl to let the audience see that he is Schriften. In the next scene, a sailor recounts how a mysterious person came to the wedding as if to \"forbid the banns,\" plunged the hall into darkness, and made both bride and bridegroom disappear. In the scene after that, Schriften appears in a dark basaltic cavern with Estelle draped over his shoulder. Left alone by Schriften's servant Pieter, she finds Vanderdecken lying unconscious in a ruined boat and revives him. He attempts to climb out of the cavern by some perilous rock steps, but Schriften intercepts him and throws him to his death. \n The final act begins on a Portugese brig, where the sailors suspect a passenger, Schriften, of being a devil. He answers their threats like one, but urges them to interrogate a woman whom he brought aboard, the widow Estelle Vanderdecken, urging them to cast her adrift as a sorceress. The sailors cast off both passengers. Marooned on a rock and awaiting the tide that will drown them, Schriften offers Estelle a chance to kill the man who abducted her, scuttled the ship, and killed her husband. She refuses to commit evil and forgives him with all her heart. Astonished at encountering \"the highest attribute of heaven,\" this \"arch enemy of mankind\" tells her that her husband did not in fact die, but then he leaves her to drown. Vanderdecken shows up on another ship to rescue her. Finis."

  "020054footandmouth": {
    "note": " The \"foot and mouth disease,\" sometimes called hoof-and-mouth disease, is a highly infectious ailment that afflicts cloven-hoofed livestock: cattle, pigs, sheep, goats. The name comes from dangerous blisters that form in the animal's mouth and on its feet. On 16 June 1904, some Dubliners are alarmed about a possible outbreak in Ireland, which could result in an embargo being imposed on the country's cattle—a serious economic threat, given the fact that at the time fully half of the land in Ireland was used for raising cattle.",
    "expandedNote": " Foot-and-mouth is a serious plague for farmers, and through the years various steps have been taken to combat its spread: quarantine, vaccination (never highly effective, since the virus mutates rapidly), mass slaughter of affected animals, and trade restrictions. This last concern motivates Mr. Deasy in Nestor. He is alarmed about \"our cattle trade,\" a crucial piece of the Irish economy for several centuries. \"You will see at the next outbreak they will put an embargo on Irish cattle,\" he tells Stephen. The letter to the editor that he is asking Stephen to place in two newspapers is thus a patriotic effort to ward off a potential threat to the Irish economy by taking proactive steps to vaccinate animals against the disease. (The cause was shown to be viral in 1897, but no effective vaccine had been developed by 1904.)\n The author of Ulysses shared Deasy's concern. Joyce learned of an outbreak of FMD in Ireland from his friend Henry Blackwood Price in 1912, and incorporated the news when he wrote Nestor five years later. Gifford notes, however, that \"The occasion of Mr. Deasy's letter is somewhat anachronistic, since there was no outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Ireland in 1904, indeed not until 1912.\" It is worth thinking about that Joyce, so scrupulous a realist, cared enough about including this detail in his novel that he was willing to accept the anachronism.\n In Aeolus, we see Stephen shopping Deasy's letter to Myles Crawford, the editor of the Evening Telegraph, and George Russell, the editor of the Irish Homestead. Deasy has also, he tells Stephen, sent a copy of his letter to \"Mr Field, M.P.\" to lay before \"a meeting of the cattletraders' association.\" In Cyclops Joe Hynes reports that he has attended this meeting—he has come to Barney Kiernan's pub to tell the Citizen about the foot-and-mouth threat—and that Joseph Nannetti has gone to London to take up the matter in Parliament.\n The issue excites interest in several other chapters as well. In Eumaeus Bloom comes across Mr. Deasy's letter while reading the Evening Telegraph in the cabman's shelter; he has had his own thoughts about foot-and-mouth disease in Lestrygonians. In Oxen of the Sun the men at the hospital, having heard of the letter published in the Telegraph, talk about \"Kerry cows that are to be butchered along of the plague.\""

  "040051footleaf": {
    "note": " Trying to close the front door most of the way, but not so far as to engage the lock, Bloom eases it toward him \"till the footleaf dropped gently over the threshold, a limp lid,\" and he is satisfied with the appearance: \"Looked shut.\" It is clear enough what is happening here, generally speaking: something at the foot of the door is covering the threshold, making it appear closed. But what exactly is a \"footleaf\"?",
    "expandedNote": " David J. Wilson, who raised the issue with me in a personal communication, writes, \"This is a question which never occurred to me in fifty years of Ulysses-consciousness. But once it is asked, the solution is obvious. First, look the word up in the Oxford English Dictionary. My eyes nearly popped out of my head: No Entry Found. Next, with trembling fingers, I looked in Gifford. Not a peep. Then I googled it. Plenty of hits, but the relevant ones were all to Ulysses itself. The problem is, of course, that footleaf is hiding in plain sight—in context, the meaning is 'obvious.' Next step is to look at The Door Itself.\"\n Wilson accepts, then, that Joyce may have coined the word, but he reasons that it is referring to an actual feature of the door at 7 Eccles Street, and presumably to many other Georgian doors in Dublin. Looking at pre-1967 photographs of the door, he identifies a thick extension at the bottom, covering the threshold. His conclusion: \"The footleaf is, beyond doubt, as solid as any part of the door. It is not added on to the door—it is integral. It may be described as a “limp lid,” but it is made of thick oak. It is not a “sweep” to keep the roaches out. Nor is it a draught-excluder! This footleaf has one, and only one, great function—it keeps out the rain. If you can’t see this perfectly plainly for yourself, then may the devil break the hasp of your back.\"\n The caustic conclusion to his remarks was directed at the writer of this note, who had the temerity to observe that it would be strange to refer to a thick and fixed part of the door as a \"limp lid,\" or to say that it \"dropped gently over the threshold.\" I had wondered whether house doors in the Edwardian era had something comparable to the flexible \"sweep\" that forms part of the weatherstripping of many house doors today.\n The reality may lie somewhere between our opposite hunches. Close inspection of the second photograph accompanying this note will reveal that the lines of shadow from the area railing to the left of the door bend as they cross the lowest part of the door. Clearly it angles outward. Is there a hinged wooden flap at the base of the door? Could a wooden flap be installed in such a way as to swing in both directions over the threshold? Answers to these questions may require a visit to the James Joyce Centre."

  "030135fortunesknave": {
    "note": " In addition to lines from Hamlet,Macbeth, King Lear, and Twelfth Night, Stephen quotes from Antony and Cleopatra in Proteus when he conceives of Mulligan as \"fortune's knave.\" The allusion implies both resentment and contempt for worldly success.",
    "expandedNote": " In act 5 of Shakespeare's play Cleopatra has lost her lover Antony to suicide and must decide whether to follow him into the afterlife or to make her peace with the new sole ruler of the Mediterranean, Octavius Caesar. The decision is made for her when she learns that Octavius intends to remove her from Egypt and lead her in triumph through the streets of Rome. But even before she learns the extent of Caesar's political ruthlessness and his immunity to her charms, she readies herself to renounce life: \n My desolation does begin to make\n A better life. 'Tis paltry to be Caesar;\n Not being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave,\n A minister of her will: and it is great\n To do that thing that ends all other deeds,\n Which shackles accidents and bolts up change,\n Which sleeps, and never palates more the dung, \n The beggar's nurse and Caesar's. (5.2.1-8)\n In Shakespeare's iconography, Fortune is the amoral distributor of worldly goods and evils—arbitrary, inscrutable, and blind to human merit. Power, wealth, and status, Cleopatra reasons, amount to nothing more than \"dung,\" and they do not say anything good about their possessor. He is Fortune's underling, her bitch, and thus \"paltry.\" \n This is, of course, the compensatory logic of someone who has just fallen from the top of Fortune's wheel and did not disdain its gifts when she possessed them. But it contributes to the magnificent rhetoric of transcendence that makes the end of Antony and Cleopatra a sublime experience. Stephen hitches himself to this wagon when he slights Mulligan's wealth, his assured self-possession, and his imminent worldly success as the trappings of mere \"fortune.\" Like the political \"pretenders\" that he will go on to contemplate, he constructs Mulligan as outwardly splendid but inherently paltry."

The water there, though deep, is less than forty feet, so the source of the name is anyone's guess. In Joyce’s time only men swam in its cold waters, and bathing suits were optional. Flann O’Brien’s At Swim-Two-Birds features the same swimming hole.\n Joyce twice refers to the waters in the hole as \"the creek,\" apparently because the ceaseless movement of ocean water into and out of the inlet gave him the impression of a river of water."

  "030069founddrowned": {
    "note": " The phrase \"Found drowned,\" which appears in several chapters of Ulysses, was a stock formulation in Victorian and Edwardian newspapers. Thornton observes that its use derived \"from the fact that 'found drowned' is the official coroner's jury's verdict when a person is so found and no foul play is suspected. Such an instance occurs in theFreeman's Journal for March 29, 1904.\"",
    "expandedNote": " Bloom's thoughts about the dayfather in Aeolus suggest how common the phrase was in contemporary newspapers: \"Queer lot of stuff he must have put through his hands in his time: obituary notices, pubs' ads, speeches, divorce suits, found drowned.\" In Eumaeus the narrator speculates about what the old sailor may be reading in the newspaper: \"Thereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon Lord only knows what, found drowned or the exploits of King Willow, Iremonger having made a hundred and something second wicket not out for Notts.\" Stephen too calls the phrase to mind in Proteus when he thinks of the corpse that is expected to surface soon in Dublin Bay: \"Found drowned. High water at Dublin bar.\" The latter phrase too was a commonplace. As Gifford notes, it was used in the tidetables published in the 1904 issue of Thom's directory. \n It would appear from other literary uses of the expression that Victorians associated it with people presumed to have committed suicide. The allegorical painter George Frederic Watts tried his hand at social realism in several striking oil paintings that included Found Drowned (ca. 1850), a response to Thomas Hood's poem The Bridge of Sighs (1844). The canvas shows a woman who has been pulled from the Thames after committing suicide to escape sexual disgrace. Charles Dickens' Bleak House (1853) acknowledges the frequency of such suicides. When Esther Summerson and Mr. Bucket are searching for Lady Dedlock, Esther sees the detective talking with some policemen and sailors against a slimy wall that holds a bill with the words, \"'FOUND DROWNED;' and this, and an inscription about Drags, possessed me with the awful suspicion shadowed forth in our visit to that place\" (ch. 57)."

In 1904 the monument had not yet been erected, so Bloom sees nothing more than the foundation stone: \"Foundation stone for Parnell. Breakdown. Heart.\"",
    "expandedNote": " The base for the monument to the great man was constructed in 1899, but not until 1911 did it receive the statue made by notable American sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens and the triangular granite column designed by architects Henry Bacon and George P. Sheridan. Unlike O'Connell at the south end of the boulevard, Parnell stands at the bottom of the obelisk, and he looks down the street. Some Irish wits (Dubliners are notoriously irreverent toward their public works of art) have observed that Parnell's raised hand seems to be pointing toward the Rotunda, suggesting that when he says, \"No man has a right to fix the boundary to the march of a nation,\" he is urging his countrymen to outbreed the competition.\n If other monuments to great men along the route of the funeral carriages suggest ghosts living on in the present, Parnell's unfinished stone evokes (in Bloom) simply loss. The \"Breakdown\" happened after Parnell lost control of his party in the wake of the Katharine O'Shea scandal. Struggling desperately to return to the public's good graces, he undertook a grueling schedule of speeches around the nation, and, Gifford notes, \"in so doing he seriously undermined his already precarious health. He finally broke down after being soaked in the rain during a speaking engagement and died of a complex of causes (rheumatism, pneumonia, etc.) simplistically diagnosed as 'heart attack.'\""

As a young man Joyce studied German in order to read Hauptmann's plays (Ellmann 76, 87) and he continued to learn more of it during his years in Europe (including especially some time spent living in Zurich), but he never became as fluent in the language as he was in French and Italian.",

Gifford translates the sense contextually as \"the mild exclamation 'enough!'\"\n Still later in Proteus, Stephen thinks of his fear of the water in comparison to Mulligan's heroism, asking himself, \"Would you do what he did?

  "050021freeman": {
    "note": " The Freeman's Journal, often called simply the \"Freeman\" in Ulysses, was one of Dublin's daily newspapers. This nationalist publication (a designation more deserved at some times than at others) was Ireland's first truly national paper during the 19th century, and in 1904 its circulation was so large that it could claim, in weekly ads, to be \"the leading Irish newspaper.\" Leopold Bloom works for the paper lining up ads—in Lestrygonians Nosey Flynn tells Davy Byrne that \"He does canvassing for the Freeman\"—and from Lotus Eaters to Sirens Bloom carries around a copy of the June 16 issue.",
    "expandedNote": " The Freeman's Journal was founded in 1763 by Charles Lucas as a voice for the ecumenical Protestant nationalism that produced leaders like Henry Grattan and Henry Flood and, later, Wolfe Tone and Robert Emmet. The paper regressed to more pro-British views from 1784 to 1802 under the editorship of Francis Higgins, the \"Sham Squire,\" but it regained its moral footing in the 19th century, especially under the ownership of Sir John Gray from the 1840s to the early 70s, when it advocated for land reform, disestablishment of the Church of Ireland, and Catholic civil rights. Gray's son, Edmund Dwyer Gray, took over management of the paper in 1875 and involved it in the nationalist campaign for Home Rule, which made it hated and feared in England.\n Ambivalent attitudes toward Charles Stewart Parnell that originated with John Gray kept the paper loyal to the great Irish parliamentary leader in the immediate aftermath of the O'Shea divorce scandal that tore apart his party, but finally caused it to renounce him in September 1891. In March 1892 theFreeman merged with a paper called the National Press, resulting in the full name used twice in Ulysses,the \"Freeman's Journal and National Press.\" In 1924 the paper was acquired by the Irish Independent,a paper that had been launched in late 1891 to support the Parnellite cause. For many decades the masthead of the Independent proclaimed that it had swallowed up the Freeman.\n Having thought in Calypso about his paper's logo ofa homerule sun rising up in the northwest, Bloom walks around with a copy of the day's Freeman throughout Lotus Eaters. He carries it in a sidepocket of his jacket, rolls it up lengthwise into a \"baton\" and taps his leg with it, sticks it in his armpit, unfolds it to look at ads, and uses it to shield Martha Clifford's letter from view. Most consequentially, he lends it to Bantam Lyons and takes it back after offering to let Lyons keep it. It is this paper that persuades Lyons to put down money on the horse Throwaway, because Bloom says, \"I was just going to throw it away.\" Ithacalooks back on the decisive impact that Bloom's newspaper had \"when, when Frederick M. (Bantam) Lyons had rapidly and successively requested, perused and restituted the copy of the current issue of the Freeman’s Journal and National Press which he had been about to throw away (subsequently thrown away), he had proceeded towards the oriental edifice of the Turkish and Warm Baths, 11 Leinster street, with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the secret of the race, graven in the language of prediction.\"\n Knowing that Bloom has \"subsequently thrown away\" the paper raises the question of whether the novel has represented this action. No surprise: it has. In Hades Bloom is still holding it as he steps out of the carriage, and in the mortuary chapel he unfolds it to kneel upon. At the end of Lestrygonians he finds it still in his coat pocket as he rummages for his lemon soap: \"Try all pockets. Handker. Freeman. Where did I? Ah, yes. Trousers. Potato. Purse. Where?\" Sirens shows it still to be in his possession in the Ormond dining room, performing the same trick of shielding clandestine correspondence as he composes a reply to Martha: \"Down the edge of his Freeman baton ranged Bloom’s, your other eye, scanning for where did I see that. Callan, Coleman, Dignam Patrick. Heigho! Heigho! Fawcett. Aha! Just I was looking... / Hope he’s not looking, cute as a rat. He held unfurled his Freeman. Can’t see now.\" \n But somewhat later in Sirens, as he thinks about getting out of the Ormond bar before Ben Dollard finishes singing The Croppy Boy, Bloom's thoughts indicate that he will leave the paper lying on the restaurant table: \"Get out before the end. Thanks, that was heavenly. Where's my hat. Pass by her. Can leave that Freeman.\""

John Smith, Sir Walter Scott, Friedrich von Schiller, and Daniel Webster, none of them 'French Celts.'\" In 1773, after the Seven Years War and the concluding Treaty of Paris (1763) added immense new territories to Britain's empire, the colonial administrator George Macartney, an Irishman descended from Scottish forbears who became an earl in England, wrote of \"a vast Empire, on which the sun never sets.\"\n No one has ever identified a source of the sort that Deasy refers to, and his notion is preposterous on its face, considering that no worldwide \"French Celt\" empire ever existed. The schoolmaster continues to pile up egregious misstatements, making his structural analogy to wise old Nestor seem more and more parodic."

    "note": " In the 1790s, when Irish patriots were looking for French assistance in their uprising against the British, a song called The Shan Van Vocht crystallized Irish feelings about the looming conflict. Mulligan's \"when the French were on the sea\" in Telemachus alludes to a line in the song, and in Cyclops Ned Lambert repeats this nugget of Irish cultural memory: \"Since the poor old woman told us that the French were on the sea and landed at Killala.\"",
    "expandedNote": " Once in 1796 and twice in 1798, the French sent fleets to Ireland to aid the enemies of their imperial rival, Great Britain. In December 1796 the large Expédition d'Irlande, commanded by General Lazare Hoche, failed to land at Bantry Bay in very bad weather, dashing the revolutionary hopes that had been raised by Wolfe Tone's embassy to the French government. In August 1798, well into the Rising that had begun in the spring, the French landed ships at Killala, in County Mayo. The troops transported by those ships joined forces with Irish rebels and enjoyed some initial success, but were soon defeated. In October another French force attempted to land in County Donegal, but was defeated at sea by the Royal Navy. Wolfe Tone, on board one of those ships, was captured and sentenced to die. \n Contrary to this bleak historical reality, the ballad, sometimes described as the Marseillaise of Ireland, sings a song of hope. In it, the Shan Van Vocht proclaims that “the French are in the Bay” and predicts that “the Orange will decay.”"

    "note": " Bloom thinks of Queen Victoria's ostentatious mourning for her prematurely deceased husband, Albert, and of the ostentatious mourning that she prescribed for her own passing, as a tad overdone: \"Drawn on a guncarriage. Victoria and Albert. Frogmore memorial mourning.\" On 2 February 1901 the Queen's coffin, bearing her body dressed in a white dress and her wedding veil, was indeed drawn on a gun carriage, in an immense procession of soldiers, sailors, and leaders bedecked in military regalia, serenaded by the booming of naval guns. Two days later, the coffin was placed in a huge sarcophagus in the richly appointed Frogmore mausoleum that she had ordered to house herself and her beloved husband in death.",
    "expandedNote": " Rather than be buried in Westminster Abbey, Victoria and Albert desired a mausoleum of their own, and had long planned to build one. When Albert unexpectedly died in 1861, work had already begun on a mausoleum for the queen's mother on the grounds of the Frogmore Estate that adjoins Windsor Castle, in Berkshire. (The park is so called because many frogs live in the surrounding marshes.) Albert's death accelerated plans for a royal resting place. The building was finished in a year, and the interior decorations, which are opulent and ornate, were completed over the next decade. At the center of all the show, Victoria's coffin lies beside Albert's in a 30-ton sarcophagus carved from a single block of flawless, polished Aberdeen granite. Marble effigies of the Queen and her Prince Consort adorn the top of the sarcophagus. \n Bloom's comment on Victoria's decision, late in her life, to moderate slightly her extravagant personal mourning for Albert—\"But in the end she put a few violets in her bonnet. Vain in her heart of hearts\"—seems to imply also a criticism of her very public funerary arrangements. Dead bodies do not require such attention."

  "030061furiousdean": {
    "note": " Remembering his time in Marsh's Library, in the enclosure of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Stephen thinks of the important Dublin-born writer Jonathan Swift, who was Dean of that cathedral from 1713 to 1745. Stephen thinks of the \"furious dean\" as misanthopic and mentally ill, associating both states with the fictional Gulliver who would (if he could) have deserted his own species for the rational horses he met on a Pacific island: \"A hater of his kind ran from them to the wood of madness, his mane foaming in the moon, his eyeballs stars. Houyhnhnm, horsenostrilled.\"",
    "expandedNote": " In the fourth book of Swift's Gulliver's Travels, the protagonist lands on an island populated by filthy, inarticulate, avaricious, libidinous, and murderous apes called Yahoos and orderly, logical, serene, selfless, kind horses called Houyhnhnms. The apes clearly are intended as a satirical portrait of human beings, as becomes clear when the horses see the rational Gulliver without his clothes on and realize with horror that they have been harboring a Yahoo. The horses strike Gulliver, and many of his readers, as a utopian alternative to human failings similar to those envisioned in Sir Thomas More's Utopia and Plato's Republic. \n But the horses need not be read so idealistically. In their feelings (or lack of feelings) about childrearing and mourning they seem simply inhuman, and their serious consideration of a proposal to exterminate all the Yahoos associates them with one of the worst propensities of humanity. Banished from the island as a lovable but undeniable Yahoo, Gulliver returns to England, in Stephen's words, \"a hater of his kind.\" He stuffs herbs in his nostrils to mask the unbearable smell of his own wife and children, and his only happy moments are spent in the company of the horses in his stable. Confronted with this eccentric behavior, the reader who has sympathetically followed Gulliver's narration cannot help but consider the possibility that he has lost his wits. \n Jonathan Swift was not mad; he suffered from Ménière's disease. Nor was he completely a misanthrope; as Gifford notes, he defined man not as a rational or irrational being but as animal rationis capax, an animal capable of reason. He hated the irrational mob as much as Stephen supposes when he imagines him fleeing \"The hundredheaded rabble of the cathedral close,\" but he harbored deep, romantic affection for virtuous individuals. In judging Swift to be a misanthropic lunatic, Stephen seems to be following some dominant biographical and critical opinions of the 19th and early 20th centuries. \n Swift plays a bigger role in Finnegans Wake than in Ulysses, but Joyce's respect for the great Anglo-Irish writer remained grudging. Ellmann notes that he told Padraic Colum that \"He made a mess of two women's lives.\" And when Colum praised Swift's intensity, Joyce replied, \"There is more intensity in a single passage of Mangan's than in all Swift's writing\" (545n). Nevertheless, by associating Swift with Joachim of Fiore (\"Abbas father, furious dean, what offence laid fire to their brains?\"), Stephen seems to discern high prophetic purpose in his ravings. In Stephen Hero he has read an 1897 story by William Butler Yeats, \"The Tables of the Law,\" that links the two men. The protagonist, Owen Aherne, says that \"Jonathan Swift made a soul for the gentlemen of this city by hating his neighbor as himself.\" It does not seem improbable to connect Swift's uncompromising moral aspirations with Stephen's own ambition, as he goes off to exile at the end of A Portrait, \"to forge in the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race.\""

  "060040gaietytheatre": {
    "note": " Of the large conventional theaters operating in Dublin in 1904, only \"the Gaiety\" still operates today, the Theatre Royal and the Queen's Theatre having both closed their doors in the 1960s. This theater is mentioned more times in Ulysses than the other two combined, partly because Bloom considers attending a performance there on the night of June 16, and partly because, in Dublin's less than highbrow theatrical milieu, the Gaiety staged a greater number of reputable productions than the competition. It hosted many distinguished actors, four of whom surface in Bloom's and Molly's thoughts.",
    "expandedNote": " The Gaiety stands on South King Street, one block west of the corner where Grafton Street runs into St. Stephen's Green. After five short months of feverish construction, the 2,000-seat theater opened its doors on 27 November 1871 to a production of Irish playwright Oliver Goldsmith's She Stoops to Conquer. In his Encyclopedia of Dublin, Douglas Bennett notes that the proprietors, John and Michael Gunn, were given letters patent for a \"well regulated theatre and therein at all times publicly to act, represent or perform any interlude, tragedy, comedy, prelude, opera, burletta, play, farce or pantomime.\" \n Bennett notes that pantomime \"appears to have been staged from the start, and the tradition is still carried on.\" In Ithaca,we learn that Bloom has seen at least one such show at the Gaiety, the \"grand annual Christmas pantomime Sinbad the Sailor\" performed in December 1892. After sitting through the show Bloom dreamed of writing a song, \"commissioned by Michael Gunn, lessee of the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South King street,\" to be included in its \"second edition (30 January 1893).\"\n Operatic performances began as early as 1872, and Eumaeus suggests that Bloom may have attended one of those as a very young man. Sinbad reminds him \"a bit of Ludwig,alias Ledwidge, when he occupied the boards of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with the management in theFlying Dutchman, a stupendous success, and his host of admirers came in large numbers, everyone simply flocking to hear him.\" William Ledwidge, an Irish baritone who took the stage name Ludwig, performed the leading role in this opera with the Carl Rosa Opera Company to huge acclaim in 1877, when Bloom was 11 years old. Commentators disagree about which version of The Flying Dutchman was performed: Wagner's seminal work of 1843 or a later, lesser musical. \n As the funeral carriage passes some advertising posters in Hades, Bloom thinks that he could attend a performance of Leah, the Forsaken at the end of the day, and he contemplates cadging a free ticket: \"Martin Cunningham could work a pass for the Gaiety. Have to stand a drink or two. As broad as it's long.\" At the end of the day he regrets his failure \"to obtain admission (gratuitous or paid) to the performance of Leah by Mrs Bandmann Palmer at the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South King street.\" But when he crawls into bed with Molly, one of several dishonest responses to her \"interrogation\" noted by the narrator of Ithaca is a fabricated visit: \"he included mention of a performance by Mrs Bandmann Palmer of Leah at the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South King street.\"\n It turns out that his thoughts of visiting the Gaiety in the evening began well before the mention of that theater in Hades, and even before the moment in Lotus Eaters when Bloom first learns about the show: \"Hello. Leah tonight. Mrs Bandmann Palmer.\" It traces back to a discussion with Molly that the book never represents, though it must have occurred between Calypso and Lotus Eaters. In Penelope Molly remembers what her husband said just before leaving the house in the morning: \"he said Im dining out and going to the Gaiety.\" Bloom lies, then, to validate a promise that he made to his wife in a conspiratorial effort to let her know that he would not be interrupting her reception of Blazes Boylan. \n The American Millicent Bandmann-Palmer was a respected actress who resisted the demand for musical comedy at the turn of the century, dedicating much of her career to performing Shakespeare and other substantial writers. Among more popular plays, the poster for 13-18 June 1904 reproduced here advertises her performances in Hamlet and an adaptation of Schiller's Maria Stuart.\n Many other distinguished actors appeared on the Gaiety stage in the decades following its founding. Molly thinks of being \"in the pit at the Gaiety for Beerbohm Tree in Trilby,\" referencing English actor and theater manager Herbert Beerbohm Tree, who likewise balanced performance of popular works with a steady diet of Shakespeare and other classic plays. She recalls too a time when Bloom succeeded in \"working a pass for the Gaiety\" by the kind of trading that he imagines in Hades: \"the one and only time we were in a box that Michael Gunn gave him to see Mrs Kendal and her husband at the Gaiety something he did about insurance for him in Drimmies.\" Like Beerbohm Tree, Dame Madge Kendal and her husband William were English actors and theater managers who balanced devotion to Shakespeare with willingness to feed the appetite for popular comedies. \n Bennett observes that in the 1890s the Gaiety \"was completely redesigned by the theatrical architect Frank Matcham, and his layout has survived to the present day.\" Allowing for superficial changes, then, this theater offers Joyceans an opportunity to imagine Dublin as it was in 1904."

  "020017deasy": {
    "note": " Joyce modeled \"Mr Deasy\" on Francis Irwin, the owner and headmaster of the Clifton School in Dalkey, where he worked for several weeks or months in March-June 1904. Altering some details and keeping others, he created a vivid portrait of a blustery old man whose authoritative advice is undermined by frequent errors of fact.",
    "expandedNote": " Deasy is richly characterized by a host of little physical details that make him appear antiquated and decrepit: his \"gaitered feet, the \"angry white moustache\" that is also called a \"rare moustache\" as he blows the wispy threads away from his mouth, \"the honey of his ill-dyed head,\" the \"coughball of laughter [that] leaped from his throat dragging after it a rattling chain of phlegm.\" Preparing to utter wisdom, \"He raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke.\" These unattractive physical attributes cohere with his habit of not listening to what other people are saying, and his curmudgeonly insistence on giving unwanted advice.\n According to Ellmann, Irwin was \"an Ulster Scot, very pro-British\" (153), and this conservative Protestant heritage is strongly pronounced in Deasy. Gifford adds that the fictional name \"may owe something to the Deasy Act (1860), an act ostensibly intended for land reform in Ireland but in practice a ruthless regulation of land tenancy in favor of landlords (i.e., in favor of the pro-English, anti-Catholic Establishment)\" (33). Deasy regards the Catholic, nationalist, freethinking, and wildly prodigal Stephen as an antagonist: \"I like to break a lance with you, old as I am.\" Stephen might well say of him what he says in Circe about the British soldiers: \"I seem to annoy them. Green rag to a bull.\" In addition to his Protestant respect for money, which Stephen might learn something from, he represents many values that cannot benefit his employee: Unionism,anti-Semitism, and misogyny.\n Ellmann observes that Francis Irwin was an alcoholic with a very red nose, and that his malady forced him to close down the school not long after Joyce's departure. Joyce left out this detail, and gave Garrett Deasy (we learn his first name in Aeolus) an estranged wife which the bachelor Irwin did not have. He also incorporated characteristics of Henry Blackwood Price, a man he knew in Trieste: \"preoccupation with a distinguished Ulster ancestry,\" and \"interest in the hoof-and-mouth disease\" (153)."

  "080031gasthensolid": {
    "note": " Feeling discouraged in Lestrygonians by his inability to understand the concept of parallax, Bloom indulges another uneasy astronomical thought: \"Gasballs spinning about, crossing each other, passing. Same old dingdong always. Gas: then solid: then world: then cold: then dead shell drifting around, frozen rock, like that pineapple rock.\" His thought that even planets are born and die indicates awareness of an astronomical theory, controversial in the 19th century, that is largely accepted today, albeit with some modifications. Dubbed the \"nebular hypothesis,\" it holds that solar systems—our own, and potentially many others in the universe—are formed by the gravitational contraction of clouds of gas and dust. Ithaca summarizes the science in the phrase \"the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns,\" and Bloom's dyspeptic thoughts in Lestrygonians sketch one kind of philosophical response to the science.",
    "expandedNote": " Building on ideas advanced earlier in the 18th century by Emanuel Swedenborg and Immanuel Kant, French astrophysicist Pierre-Simon Laplace reasoned from Newtonian principles that gravity could cause the gas in interstellar clouds (\"nebulae\") eventually to collapse into hot spheres, forming young stars and planets. In his Exposition du Système du Monde (1796), Laplace conjectured that our sun was born from a \"fiery mist\" and at one time was surrounded by a vast atmosphere of hot gas and dust that flattened into a disk and produced planets as it rotated, contracted, and cooled. As telescopes revealed nebulae that seemed to be forming stars, just as predicted, 19th century intellectuals wrestled with the theory's implications. By the end of the century its explanatory power was widely acknowledged, though scientists by then knew that high temperature need not be attributed to the original nebula, since gravitational contraction would itself produce great heat. (Understanding of nuclear fusion in stars would come later still.)\n Robert Stawell Ball's The Story of the Heavens (1886), which sits on Bloom's bookshelf, acknowledges that Laplace offered his model only as a conjecture but suggests that it fits the known facts well: \"Such is, in fact, the doctrine of the origin of our system which has been advanced in that celebrated speculation known as the nebular theory of Laplace....It is merely a conjecture, more or less plausible, but perhaps in some degree necessarily true, if our present laws of heat, as we understand them, admit of the extreme application here required\" (526). Ball focuses on Laplace's idea of progressive cooling, noting that it accounts not only for our hot sun but also for the formation of planets and moons: \"Precisely similar reasoning may be extended to the individual planets: the farther we look back, the hotter and the hotter does the whole system become. It has been thought that if we could look far enough back, we should see the earth too hot for life; back further still, we should find the earth and all the planets red-hot; and back further still, to an exceedingly remote epoch, when the planets would be heated just as much as our sun is now. In a still earlier stage the whole solar system is thought to have been one vast mass of glowing gas, from which the present forms of the sun, with the planets and their satellites, have been gradually evolved\" (526).\n As Ball observes, the hypothesis arose in response to three remarkable physical coincidences: the planets in our solar system occupy the same plane, they revolve around the sun in the same direction, and they rotate on their axes in the same direction. \"Suppose that countless ages ago a mighty nebula was slowly rotating and slowly contracting. In the process of contraction, portions of the condensed matter of the nebula would be left behind. These portions would still revolve around the central mass, and each portion would rotate on its axis in the same direction. As the process of contraction proceeded, it would follow from dynamical principles that the velocity of rotation would increase; and thus at length these portions would consolidate into planets, while the central mass would gradually contract to form the sun. By a similar process on a smaller scale the systems of satellites were evolved\" (527).\n Our lifetimes are far too short to observe these processes, which take place over tens or hundreds of millions of years, but the temporal progression can be read in space, as one does with trees of different ages in a forest, or as geologists do with rocks and fossils: \"The nebular origin of the solar system receives considerable countenance from the study of the sidereal heavens. We have already dwelt upon the resemblance between the sun and the stars. If, then, our sun has passed through such changes as the nebular theory requires, may we not anticipate that similar phenomena should be met with in other stars? If this be so, it is reasonable to suppose that the evolution of some of the stars may not have progressed so far as has that of the sun, and thus we may be able actually to witness stars in the earlier phases of their development\" (527). Such an inference was made, Ball observes, by the great astronomer William Herschel (1738-1822), who catalogued thousands of nebulae in 1802 and again in 1820: \"by looking at one nebula after another, the astronomer thinks he is able to detect the various stages which connect the nebula in its original form with the final form. He is thus led to believe that each of the nebulæ passes, in the course of ages, through these stages. And thus Herschel adopted the opinion that stars—some, many, or all—have each originated from what was once a glowing nebula\" (529).\n Herschel's observational support of Laplace's theory stirred passionate responses from intellectuals for decades to come. Social reformists were heartened by the notion that the night sky's awe-inspiring displays might have been produced by humanly intelligible forces operating in real time and space. Proponents of the nebular hypothesis, particularly two Scots—publisher Robert Chambers (1802-71) and astronomer and social reformer John Pringle Nichol (1804-59)—saw it as evidence that dynamism and progressive development lay at the heart of the cosmos. In a series of public lectures and books that did much to popularize the theory, Nichol argued that everything in the universe is driven by vital forces of progressive evolution, making social reform seem irresistible. His romantic interpretation of the science inspired thinkers as diverse as John Stuart Mill, George Eliot, and William Thompson, Baron Kelvin. \n Although Nichol's progressivist cosmos appealed to Herbert Spencer (for reasons that Nichol would not have approved), most social conservatives abhorred it. The nebular hypothesis also rankled many proponents of traditional religious faith, by doing to the heavens what geology was doing to the physical structures of the earth and evolutionary biology to the understanding of life forms. If Laplace's account of star-formation was even partly true, then the cosmos was no longer a divinely perfect, static creation—the heavens had been regarded as changeless since Aristotle—but a maelstrom of cascading physical forces. People of faith felt their conception of the world to be threatened by these new observations and theory, just as it had been in the 17th century when Galileo saw evidence of celestial change in things like sunspots and supernovae and mounted a heliocentric challenge to the dominant Ptolemaic cosmology.\n In the 1840s and 50s two Anglo-Irish astronomers—William Parsons, the 3rd Earl of Rosse (1800-67) and Thomas Romney Robinson (1792-1882), an astrophysicist who was director of the Armagh observatory—joined forces to prove Herschel wrong. Robinson was an ordained Anglican priest who expressed disbelief in \"what has been called the Nebular Hypothesis.\" His friend Lord Rosse built a six-foot reflector telescope (\"the Leviathan of Parsonstown,\" the world's largest by aperture) on his land in King's County (now County Offaly) with the intention of showing that nebulae, rather than being gaseous, were actually composed of countless stars that existing telescopes had failed to resolve. Rosse was partly right: some of the many known \"nebulae\" turned out actually to be galaxies. He and Robinson published many reports and drawings of the observations made through the huge telescope, but they did not succeed in decisively refuting Herschel's claims. Later, the spectroscopic analysis of William Huggins would demonstrate the gaseous nature of true nebulae.\n For people inclined to accept the new model, John Pringle Nichol's exuberant optimism was not the only possible emotional response. Change can be for better or for worse, after all. In life forms it encompasses both growth and decay, and the physics of Laplace's theory implied no less. William Whewell (1794-1866), the Cambridge polymath who coined the phrase \"nebular hypothesis\" (as well as \"scientist,\" \"physicist,\" \"catastrophism,\" \"uniformitarianism,\" and many other neologisms), was a devout Christian who believed in intelligent design, but he also appreciated the importance of bold theoretical claims. Whewell accepted Laplace's account of the formation of solar systems. In chapter 7 of Astronomy and General Physics he summarized the theory and then, in chapter 8, he imagined its end results. The physics led him to conclude that a system so constituted would continue to lose heat and would also very gradually slow down, leading eventually to cold stasis: \"It now appears that the courses of the heavens themselves are not exempt from the universal law of decay; that not only the rocks and the mountains, but the sun and the moon have the sentence 'to end' stamped upon their foreheads. They enjoy no privilege beyond man except a longer respite\" (8th ed., 1847, 202). \n Whewell was foreseeing the ultimate triumph of entropy. Astrophysicists since his time have predicted many such forms of slow, inevitable winding-down: the finite life-cycles of stars, the collapse of energetic and information-rich systems into black holes, the endless expansion and ultimate heat death of the universe itself. Dénouements like these rebuke the human wish for life to mean something, to be going somewhere. In his brief, bleak recapitulation of the nebular theory, Leopold Bloom appears to understand this entropic principle: first there is hot gas, then a solid planet, then an inhabited world, and then the cooling continues, until all vital heat is lost and the earth goes drifting through the cosmos as a \"frozen rock.\" According to the science that Bloom has absorbed from Ball's book, the cosmos will ultimately disappoint our desire for \"happy warmth.\" \n In Joyce and Reality: The Empirical Strikes Back (2004), John Gordon detects various other echoes of the nebular hypothesis in Joyce's fictions, from A Portrait of the Artist through Finnegans Wake."

  "030052gautiersprose": {
    "note": " The sight of the \"the gunwale of a boat, sunk in sand\" makes Stephen think of a zinger of 19th century literary criticism: \"Un coche ensablé, Louis Veuillot called Gautier's prose.\" The French means \"A coach stuck in sand.\"",
    "expandedNote": " Théophile Gautier (1811-82), Gifford notes, was \"a French poet, critic, and novelist famous for a 'flamboyant' romanticism with overtones of frank hedonism and a 'pagan' contempt for traditional morality.\" His contemporary Louis Veuillot (1813-83), a journalist and politician, opposed literary romanticism because, Gifford notes, \"the French romantics were traditionally anti-Church,\" and Veuillot was a defender of the Roman Catholic Church's secular powers in France. In an essay published in 1867, Veuillot attacked the romantics and abominated Gautier's prose in particular as weighted down by \"superlatives.\" His metaphor of a coach trapped in sand implies that prose should be light, agile, and adaptable.\n Veuillot's phrase may pop into Stephen's mind simply because he sees a boat stuck in the sand, but he uses it to meditate briefly on the protean qualities of language: \"These heavy sands are language tide and wind have silted here.\" Like the many other kinds of matter that combine to make up his life (physical elements, past experiences, family upbringing, national identity, and so forth), language too is a kind of prima materia against whose heavy shifting tug the artist must struggle to impose his shape on the world. In Veuillot's estimation, Gautier lost the battle.\n The image of being stuck in the sand will recur later in the novel as a figure evoking the phrase \"stick-in-the-mud,\" i.e. a person trapped in one of life's ruts and unable to act spontaneously. The words that Bloom, at the end of Nausicaa, inscribes in the muck with a stick, \"I. AM. . . . A.,\" combined with the fact that \"his wooden pen\" sticks upright in the sand when he flings it away, suggests that he is a stick in the mud, as well as confirming Stephen's intuition about language: \"Mr Bloom effaced the letters with his slow boot. Hopeless thing sand. Nothing grows in it. All fades.\" In Eumaeus and Penelope both he and his wife will think of the other as a stick-in-the-mud keeping them from realizing happiness."

  "100008generalslocum": {
    "note": " An event of 15 June 1904, reported in newspapers around the world on the following day, gave Joyce an occasion to include a representative horror of modern life. The General Slocum, a triple-decked side-wheel paddle steamboat carrying German-American women, children, and grandparents from lower Manhattan to a picnic spot on Long Island Sound, caught fire on the East River and sank off the Bronx shore. More than 1,000 of the approximately 1,400 people on board drowned, burned to death, died of smoke inhalation, or were crushed by huge paddle-blades, in a catastrophe made far worse by carelessness, ineptitude, and corruption. It was the worst New York disaster before the attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001, and perhaps only the greater death toll on the Titanic in 1912 has kept it from continuing its hold on cultural memory.",
    "expandedNote": " In Lotus Eaters Bloom carries around a copy of the Freeman's Journal, which reported the disaster on the morning of June 16, and in Aeolus he visits the paper's offices. In Lestrygonians, before the novel mentions any newspaper accounts, he thinks of what he has apparently learned from the Freeman: \"All those women and children excursion beanfeast burned and drowned in New York. Holocaust.\" Reports of the disaster surface in Wandering Rocks on newsboards announcing \"a dreadful catastrophe in New York,\" and inEumaeus the \"New York disaster\" is covered in the Evening Telegraph. \n But the fullest account of the horror comes in Wandering Rocks when Tom Kernan, pleased with having booked an order, stops in for a celebratory drink: \"I'll just take a thimbleful of your best gin, Mr Crimmins. A small gin, sir. Yes, sir. Terrible affair that General Slocum explosion. Terrible, terrible! A thousand casualties. And heartrending scenes. Men trampling down women and children. Most brutal thing. What do they say was the cause? Spontaneous combustion. Most scandalous revelation. Not a single lifeboat would float and the firehose all burst.\" \n \"Spontaneous combustion\" refers to the fact that the fire may have started in the ship's Lamp Room, where lamp oil, dirty rags, straw, or trash on the floor could have been ignited by a match or cigarette. When a teenage boy reported the fire to the captain, he was told to shut up and mind his own business. Some minutes later, the captain realized the truth of the boy's report, but instead of heading to the nearby Manhattan shore, where there were stores of oil and lumber, he accelerated toward an island across the river, steering his vessel into a headwind that fanned the flames.\n The \"heartrending scenes\" crowd upon one another in imagination. When the fires grew, sections of deck collapsed, pitching people into the flames below. Desperate passengers found that all the lifeboats on the ship were wired and painted down and could not be lowered into the water. Most of them could not swim, and the women who tried were weighed down by the heavy wool clothing of the time. Mothers placed life preservers on their children and threw them into the water, only to watch them sink like stones. The life preservers, which had been hanging in place for 13 years, their canvas covers rotting, were filled with cheap pulverized cork and seem to have had iron bars stuck in them to bring them up to regulation weight. The 36 crewmen had never trained in a fire drill, and when they tried to put out the fires, the hoses fell apart in their hands. Rather than assist passengers, many of them sought their own safety—among them the captain, who jumped onto a tugboat as soon as the boat settled on the river bottom, leaving his burning passengers behind. \n All of the safety equipment on the boat had passed inspection a few weeks earlier, but clearly nothing was actually inspected. The Knickerbocker Steamship Company had a long history of graft and bribery, uncovered by newspaper investigations after the disaster, and the General Slocum, which had suffered numerous groundings and collisions in its 13-year life, had sadly decayed from the showpiece it once was. Two inspectors were indicted but found not guilty. The Company received only a small fine. Only the captain, William Van Shaick, went to jail. Tom Kernan comments on the influence that big money perennially wields in America: \"What I can't understand is how the inspectors ever allowed a boat like that... Now, you're talking straight, Mr Crimmins. You know why? Palm oil. Is that a fact? Without a doubt. Well now, look at that. And America they say is the land of the free. I thought we were bad here.\"\n The people who had chartered the General Slocum for a highly festive outing to Locust Grove, Long Island, hailed from the working- and middle-class neighborhood of Kleindeutchland [sic] or Little Germany on the lower east side of Manhattan. The excursion was organized by the pastor of St. Mark's Evangelical Lutheran Church, George Haas. It was intended to celebrate the end of the church school year, and to give church members a respite from crowded, grimy Manhattan. People showed up for the long-anticipated trip in their best clothes and passed up the river in high spirits until the fire broke out.\n The Protestant faith of the victims figures in Wandering Rocks when Father Conmee, reading about the disaster, thinks complacently that \"In America those things were continually happening. Unfortunate people to die like that, unprepared. Still, an act of perfect contrition.\" \"Perfect contrition\" is a safety valve that compassionate Catholic theologians have dreamed up to save the souls of people who face death without access to the rite of extreme unction (normally required): lacking the church's intervention with God, the sinner's sincere repentance may in certain exceptional cases be enough. But this kindly indulgence can hardly be expected to apply to believers who lack the true faith."

    "note": " \"For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul and blood and ouns\": Mulligan's words imitate the Catholic priest’s action of presenting the consecrated host to the congregation, an action which itself recapitulates Jesus’ words at the Last Supper (“This is my body...This is my blood”). The mocking substitution of Christine for Christ briefly makes Mulligan’s ceremony a Satanic black mass, since this inverted mass is traditionally celebrated over a woman’s naked body.",
    "expandedNote": " On his website of the occult (www.donaldtyson.com), Donald Tyson describes the supposed practice: \"The notorious black mass was supposedly a blasphemous parody of the Catholic mass celebrated by witches or sorcerers for the purpose of defiling the most holy beliefs and practices of the Church, and thereby pleasing the Devil, who would as a reward grant to them the power to do evil. Some of its infamous features include a defrocked priest who celebrated the mass on the belly of a naked woman, and the substitution of semen for the holy chrism oil, urine for the wine, and blackened turnip or excrement for the host. During the course of the mass, the defrocked priest was said to copulate with the woman serving as the altar. Sometimes the priest inserted holy wafers into the vagina of the woman before copulation. Sometimes the copulation was anal. The words of the ritual were read backwards or distorted by replacing 'God' with 'Devil' or 'Satan.' The sign of the cross was made backwards.\"\n Tyson notes that such events were “a fantasy created by the priests of the Inquisition as the worst thing they could possibly accuse supposed witches of doing.” Various 18th and 19th century decadents, however, read literary accounts of these supposed perversities and were inspired to stage their own enactments. For further reading, see H. T. F. Rhodes’ The Satanic Mass (1954).\n Sam Slote connects \"body and soul and blood and ouns\" to Lesson 26 of the Maynooth Catechism: \"Q. What is the Blessed Eucharist? A. The Blessed Eucharist is the sacrament of the body and blood, soul and divinity of Jesus Christ, under the appearances of bread and wine.\" But \"ouns\" takes the echo of church teachings in a sacrilegious direction by recalling the expression \"God's blood and wounds,\" which Gifford identifies as \"a blasphemous oath from the late Middle Ages.\" (A shortened equivalent, \"Zounds,\" stayed in circulation in Britain throughout the 19th century.) Mulligan's pronunciation, \"blood and ouns,\" suggests that his \"preacher's tone\" may be veering into the Cockney accent which is part of his verbal repertoire. (Later in Telemachus he launches into the tune Coronation Day, \"singing out of tune with a Cockney accent.\") \n In Circe, the black mass so glancingly evoked by Mulligan’s words receives elaborate stage direction: \"On an eminence, the centre of the earth, rises the field altar of Saint Barbara. Black candles rise from its gospel and epistle horns. From the high barbicans of the tower two shafts of light fall on the smokepalled altarstone. On the altarstone Mrs Mina Purefoy, goddess of unreason, lies naked, fettered, a chalice resting on her swollen belly. Father Malachi O’Flynn, in a long petticoat and reversed chasuble, his two left feet back to the front, celebrates camp mass. The Reverend Mr Hugh C. Haines Love M.A. in a plain cassock and mortar board, his head and collar back to the front, holds over the celebrant’s head an open umbrella.\"\n This scene recycles many details of the Martello tower scene: eminence (top of the tower), center of the earth (omphalos), barbicans, shafts of light, smokepalled altarstone (hearth), chalice (shaving bowl), petticoat (dressinggown), celebrant (Malachi Mulligan),server (Haines). After the scene is set, Father Malachi chants a demonic inversion of Mulligan’s earlier “Introibo ad altare Dei”: “Introibo ad altare diaboli.” The Reverend Mr Haines Love (i.e., Hate-Love) then perverts the responsory line “To God who gladdens my youth” by chanting “To the devil which hath made glad my young days.”"

  "010122germanjews": {
    "note": " \"I don't want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either. That's our national problem, I'm afraid, just now\": Haines justifies his name in Telemachus by spouting the theory of an international Jewish conspiracy. Near the end of Nestor, the proudly Unionist Mr. Deasy subjects Stephen to more of the same: \"England is in the hands of the jews. In all the highest places: her finance, her press. And they are the signs of a nation's decay. Wherever they gather they eat up the nation's vital strength.\" Anti-Semitism was powerful not only in England but also in Germany, France, and other nations. In Proteus it surfaces briefly in Kevin Egan's mention of \"M. Drumont, famous journalist.\" These three passages alluding to European nations being undermined or overtaken by treacherous Jews set the stage for Joyce's introduction of a Jewish protagonist in the fourth chapter, and for the prejudice exhibited by various Dubliners later in the book.",
    "expandedNote": " Although distrust of Jews reaches far back into the medieval origins of Christian Europe, it took new, virulently ideological forms in the late 19th century, starting in Germany and spreading to Russia, France, and the Austro-Hungarian and British empires. The term \"anti-Semite\" was coined in 1879 by Wilhelm Marr (1819-1904), in a pamphlet titled Der Weg zum Siege des Germanenthums über das Judenthum (The Way to Victory of Germanism over Judaism). Marr's work became what Jacob Katz, in From Prejudice to Destruction: Anti-Semitism, 1700-1933 (Harvard UP, 1980), has called the \"first anti-Semitic best-seller.\" \n Marr was a student of German cultural identity whose ideas grew out of the romantic 19th century struggle to create a nation out of the disparate lands occupied by Germanic peoples. The essence of his argument, Gifford observes, was that \"Jews in Germany had already taken over the press, they had become 'dictators of the financial system,' and they were on the verge of taking over the legislature and the judiciary.\" Marr did not invent these charges: they were already current in his culture. And he was not a racial bigot in any simple sense: three of his four marriages were to women who were at least partly Jewish, and he renounced anti-Semitism and German nationalism toward the end of his life. But by depicting two races (one native, the other a foreign invader) locked in an irreconcilable struggle, and by describing a massive conspiracy to infiltrate and take over the vital systems of his society, he did more than any other individual of his time to create an ideological justification for this species of hatred.\n French society was polarized two decades later by the case of Captain Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish soldier convicted in 1894 on exceedingly flimsy grounds of giving secret military documents to the Germans. Again the assumption was that Jews would prove more loyal to their own international ethnic cabal than to the nation that had given them citizenship. When new evidence emerged in 1896 implicating a different officer, the military command suppressed the evidence, effected a hasty acquittal of the non-Jewish officer, and brought new charges against Dreyfus based on fabricated documents. \n Émile Zola published a fiery letter titled J'accuse in a prominent newspaper, stirring public pressure for Dreyfus to be acquitted in a new trial. When the trial was held in 1899, a battle for public opinion raged, led on the anti-Dreyfus side by Édouard Drumont, publisher of an anti-Semitic newspaper called La Libre Parole that had been slandering Jews since 1892. Kevin Egan does not mention Drumont's views in Proteus, but his insistence on dropping his name into his conversation with Stephen imports a French context for European anti-Semitism into the novel. Haines, who has voiced suspicion of \"German Jews\" in the previous chapter and whose name means \"hate\" in French, probably represents another indirect evocation of the Dreyfus affair, in which French bigots defended their nation from a traitor who was ostensibly working for the Germans. (Dreyfus was again convicted in the 1899 trial, but subsequently pardoned. In 1906, after years of tireless labor by his brother and his wife, the falsity of the charges against him was at last proved. He was reinstated in the French army at the rank of major, and after serving throughout World War I retired as a lieutenant colonel.)\n When Haines voices anti-Semitic views in the first chapter, it may seem that Joyce is characterizing them as a new import from England, a parasite clinging to a \"stranger.\" Deasy's more detailed exposition of the ideology in the second chapter puts an end to that slight comfort. Anti-Semitism is already well established in Ireland, and will surface many more times in the book. The men in the funeral carriage in Hades, Nosey Flynn in Lestrygonians, Buck Mulligan in Scylla and Charybdis, Lenehan in Wandering Rocks, the Citizen in Cyclops, and Bloom himself in Ithaca will all indulge invidious stereotypes about Jews. The novel's outstanding anti-Semite, the Citizen, specifically articulates the view that Jews are internationalist provocateurs who feel no loyalty to their European homes: \"What is your nation, if I may ask?\" Bloom, of course, answers that his nation is Ireland: \"I was born here. Ireland.\"\n Marr’s was not the only pamphlet fanning the flames of anti-Semitic hatred in early twentieth-century Europe. Circe alludes to the notorious Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a 1905 document forged by Russian secret police to justify pogroms by making it appear that Jews were planning a takeover of the entire civilized world. Gifford notes that the Protocols “did not turn up in western Europe until 1918-19,” but Joyce made sure that they appeared in his book, even at the price of anachronism. In a personal communication, Vincent Van Wyk notes that in Catholic countries like France and Ireland Jews were also sometimes associated with the international Protestant order of Freemasons, whose highly secret rites invited suspicions of the sort that Nosey Flynn articulates. Joyce acknowledges this association by making his Jewish protagonist a Freemason, and when Flynn says that Bloom will never sign his name (\"Nothing in black and white\"), he may be a trotting out a stereotype about Jews, Freemasons, or both groups."

  "020009ghoststory": {
    "note": " In Nestor Stephen replies to his students' clamoring for \"a story, sir,\" \"A ghoststory,\" by saying \"After\"—i.e., when the lesson is completed. He never gives them the story, but the riddle that he tells them instead does release a bit of the terrible emotional energy that he connects with ghosts, by imagining himself as a fox (he is, after all, a dogsbody) that has buried its grandmother.",
    "expandedNote": " In Telemachus Stephen recalls (twice) that he was visited \"in a dream\" by the ghost of his dead mother, and her specter will return to terrify him at a climactic moment in Circe. He gives the boys a miniscule window onto his terror by posing an unanswerable riddle and then, \"his throat itching,\" supplying the answer: \"The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush.\" \n Thornton notes (citing Joseph Prescott in MLQ 13) that the model for his riddle can be found in P. W. Joyce's English as We Speak It in Ireland, where the answer to a very similar unanswerable riddle is \"The fox burying his mother under a holly tree.\" The riddle clearly functions as an expression of the guilt that Stephen feels about having \"killed\" his mother, though he masks it slightly by changing her into a grandmother. Later in Nestor he thinks guiltily of himself as a killer: \"A poor soul gone to heaven: and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox, red reek of rapine in his fur, with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth, listened, scraped up the earth, listened, scraped and scraped.\" In Proteus he sees a dog furiously scraping in the sand and thinks, \"Something he buried there, his grandmother.\" \n For sources of the image of a fox scraping at a grave, Thornton cites a number of passages, including two from John Webster: The White Devil (\"But keep the wolf far thence, that's foe to men, / For with his nails he'll dig them up again\") and The Duchess of Malfi (\"The wolf shall find her grave, and scrape it up, / Not to devour the corpse, but to discover / The horrid murder\"). \n Eventually, Stephen will tell \"A ghoststory,\" but not to the boys. In Scylla and Charybdis his talk on Shakespeare centers on the figure of Hamlet's father's ghost: \"He will have it that Hamlet is a ghoststory . . . Like the fat boy in Pickwick he wants to make our flesh creep.\""

  "010062ghoul": {
    "note": " A \"Ghoul\" is precisely what Stephen says it is in Telemachus, a \"Chewer of corpses.\" In the alchemy of his imagination, his mother has changed from a dead body to a monster that feeds on dead bodies. She returns under this guise in Circe, and thoughts of corpses being consumed as food connect with many other reflections on human mortality in the novel.",
    "expandedNote": " In ancient Bedouin folklore, the ghul was a wily demonic creature that lived in desolate places, tricking human beings who passed by and eating their flesh. It seems that ghouls also sometimes ate bodies from graves, but this did not become their central role until they entered western culture through 18th century translations of One Thousand and One Nights, a.k.a. Arabian Nights. (Joyce owned an Italian translation of Le Mille e Una Notte when he lived in Trieste.) One French translation in particular, that of Antoine Galland (1704-1717), made ghouls into grave robbers. Galland introduced into one of Sheherazade's stories a character named Amina, who tricks a man named Sidi Nouman into marrying her. When he notices that his bride eats nothing but single grains of rice, he follows her out of the house one night and sees her feasting with other ghouls in a cemetery.\n Ghouls were shapeshifters in Arabic folklore, assuming the form either of animals (often hyenas) or the human beings that they had most recently eaten. Circe shows that Joyce is aware of the tradition of animal-like ghouls eating the dead and assuming their features: \"The beagle lifts his snout, showing the grey scorbutic face of Paddy Dignam. He has gnawed all. He exhales a putrid carcasefed breath. He grows to human size and shape. His dachshund coat becomes a brown mortuary habit. His green eye flashes bloodshot. Half of one ear, all the nose and both thumbs are ghouleaten.\"\n Reading retrospectively from this canine corpse-chewer, one may wonder whether Bloom has glimpsed a ghoul in the \"obese grey rat\" he sees crawling under a tombstone in Hades. Bloom may not know the Arabic mythology that has captured Stephen's imagination, but he certainly thinks of this \"old stager\" as straddling the border between animal and human: \"One of those chaps would make short work of a fellow. Pick the bones clean no matter who it was. Ordinary meat for them. A corpse is meat gone bad. . . . Wonder does the news go about whenever a fresh one is let down. Underground communication. We learned that from them. Wouldn't be surprised. Regular square feed for them.\"\n Stephen has no doubt that his mother has entered a world of corpse-chewing, animal-like specters. When she appears in Circe, \"her face worn and noseless,\" and urges him to repent his loss of faith, he screams, \"The ghoul! Hyena!\" Whether he thinks that his mother has become a monster, or merely that one has eaten her flesh and assumed her shape, hardly seems to matter. The lines between human and animal, living and dead, nurturing and putrescing, have been erased, in a vivid instance of what Julia Kristeva calls \"the abject.\"\n This Arabian thread in the book's manycolored tapestry clearly ties into other reflections on mankind's mortal condition: the continuity between human and animal lives implied by \"dogsbody,\" the cannibalistic possibilities raised by seeing dead flesh as \"potted meat,\" the conception of God as a carnivore, the transformations named by \"metempsychosis.\""

Nelson's Pillar rose high above all the buildings around it, affording a panoramic view of Dublin comparable to the one enjoyed today from the Gravity Bar atop the Guinness Storehouse museum, which stands 144 ft. high. The pillar's viewing platform was exposed to the elements, however, and only simple iron \"railings\" kept the people who climbed the 166 steps to the top from returning to the ground more quickly. The view from those railings was no doubt sufficiently precipitous to induce vertigo and clinched sphincters. Stephen evokes the physical discomfort experienced by his two protagonists: \"they are afraid the pillar will fall. . . . it makes them giddy to look so they pull up their skirts.\"",

Although fragments of the song lyrics appear in the text, they are supplied from someone's memory (the narrator's? Bloom's?), because the song is paradoxically \"voiceless\": \"A voiceless song sang from within.\" It quickly becomes clear that someone is playing the song on the bar's piano, and after the last strains sound the identity of that person becomes clear.",
    "expandedNote": "John Liptrot Hatton composed the song in the early 1860s, with words written by Jane Williams. Seven phrases are reproduced in order in the text of Sirens, flagged by purple links in my online edition of the chapter: \"The bright stars fade . . . the morn is breaking . . . The dewdrops pearl . . . And I from thee . . . to Flora's lips did hie . . . I could not leave thee . . . Sweetheart, goodbye!\" These appear at intervals corresponding fairly realistically to the time it takes for the notes to sound in the piano (there is a large gap of time between the lines from the beginning of the first stanza and those from the end of the second), though one phrase, \"Flora's lips,\" is inexactly remembered:\n The bright stars fade, the morn is breaking,\n The dew-drops pearl each bud and leaf,\n And I from thee my leave am taking,\n With bliss too brief, with bliss, with bliss too brief.\n How sinks my heart with fond alarms,\n The tear is hiding in mine eye, \n For time doth thrust me from thine arms.\n Goodbye, sweetheart, goodbye!\n For time doth thrust me from thine arms.\n Goodbye, sweetheart, goodbye!\n The sun is up, the lark is soaring,\n Loud swells the song of Chanticleer,\n The leveret bounds o'er earth's soft flow'ring,\n Yet I am here, yet I, yet I am here.\n For since night's gems from heaven do fade,\n And morn to floral lips doth hie,\n I could not leave thee though I said\n Goodbye, sweetheart, goodbye!\n I could not leave thee though I said\n Goodbye, sweetheart, goodbye!\n After the words of the first line are heard, the text describes the medium of the performance, a piano accompaniment calling for a singer: \"A duodene of birdnotes chirruped bright treble answer under sensitive hands. Brightly the keys, all twinkling, linked, all harpsichording, called to a voice to sing the strain of dewy morn, of youth, of love's leavetaking, life's, love's morn.\" No singer answers this call, apparently, but after the final words, Simon Dedalus walks through the bar and is invited to sing: \"Sighing, Mr Dedalus came through the saloon, a finger soothing an eyelid. / — Hoho, we will, Ben Dollard yodled jollily. Come on, Simon. Give us a ditty. We heard the piano.\" Simon resists the invitation—\"I was only vamping, man\"—but he is soon persuaded to sing another song, \"M'appari.\" \n It appears, then, that the person playing the tune was Simon Dedalus. At the end of the novel Molly thinks of his \"delicious glorious voice\" and how naturally he used to sing the title words of Goodbye, Sweetheart, Goodbye, as opposed to the ludicrous artificiality of Bartell Darcy: \"goodbye sweetheartsweetheart he always sang it not like Bartell Darcy sweet tart goodbye.\"\n Zack Bowen observes that the opening strains of the song are heard as Blazes Boylan approaches the Ormond, and that he leaves at the song's conclusion:\n — ... Sweetheart, goodbye! \n — I'm off, said Boylan with impatience. \n Despite whatever the song may mean to Bloom, then (he is present in the dining room for part of it), it is associated much more strongly with his antagonist, and the association is ironic: a Casanova saying his goodbyes to a flirtatious barmaid in order to hurry off to an adulterous conquest is serenaded by a tender song about a lover having to part from his sweetheart. \n The chapter's overture plays four of the seven phrases. Here too, the phrases appear in order, with a brief interval between the two taken from the first stanza and the two taken from the second."

  "120008gorse": {
    "note": " The paleolithic \"hero\" described near the beginning of Cyclops is covered \"with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse (Ulex Europeus).\" This plant, evoked again several times in later chapters, is an evergreen shrub covered with long green photosynthetic thorns and with shorter leaves that, rather than unfurling, form additional spines. Its \"prickly\" quality and \"toughness\" are extreme. The bush is also called \"furze,\" and makes some appearances in the novel under that name.",
    "expandedNote": " The Ulex genus comprises 20 species scattered across northwest Africa, the Iberian peninsula, and other parts of Europe. The most common one in Europe, Ulex europaeus, grows to 2 or 3 meters in height (7-10 feet). Like all members of the genus it sports beautiful yellow flowers, but its resistance to drought, fire, and animals makes it an invasive pest in many settings. Because of its thorny toughness it has often been planted in hedgerows, where it forms impenetrable thickets. It also grows wild in many parts of Ireland, and once was important for thatching roofs and burning in fireplaces. \n Gorse is adapted to recurrent fire: it ignites readily but grows back from its roots, and scorching prompts its seeds to germinate.In Nausicaa Bloom thinks of fires starting in the hills: \"Howth a while ago amethyst. Glass flashing. That’s how that wise man what’s his name with the burning glass. Then the heather goes on fire. It can’t be tourists’ matches. What? Perhaps the sticks dry rub together in the wind and light. Or broken bottles in the furze act as a burning glass in the sun.\"\n The toughness of the plant figures repeatedly in Circe. A verse of The Wren Song tells of the little bird \"caught in the furze.\" Bello uses it to convey the fearsome virility of Boylan: \"A shock of red hair he has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush!\" And Bloom's schoolday memories of the forest at Poulaphouca give way to images of him walking on Howth Head with Molly, \"Hatless, flushed, covered with burrs of thistledown and gorsespine.\"\n§ This last word did not appear in any printed text until Hans Walter Gabler's 1984 edition. The \"gorsepine\" of the first edition, although it was not corrected in any of the Odyssey Press editions of the 1930s and stayed unchanged in the Bodley Head and Modern Library editions of the early 1960s, can hardly be supposed to represent Joyce's intention. The Rosenbach manuscript clearly contains an \"s\" between \"gorse\" and \"pine\" on page 55 of Circe, and no pine trees anywhere in the world are called gorse-pines, to my knowledge. Even if such trees existed it is hard to imagine how Bloom would get burrs from them in his clothes from tramping around the Howth headland. Gorse-spines, on the other hand, can easily mess with hikers' clothes."

    "note": " The beginning of Lestrygonians finds Bloom one block north of the Liffey on O'Connell Street, gazing in the windows of a candy shop that the narrative refers to as \"Graham Lemon's\" but that most people knew as Lemon & Co. A royal license in the shop window prompts Bloom, in an act of comic subversion, to picture the British monarch as a grotesquely overgrown child.",
    "expandedNote": "Looking in the window, Bloom sees \"A sugarsticky girl shovelling scoopfuls of creams for a christian brother\" and thinks that the teacher must be buying them as a \"school treat\" for his students. Then he reads the sign announcing that the British crown has officially sanctioned the business: \"Lozenge and comfit manufacturer to His Majesty the King.\" Such licenses were, and still are, liberally granted to makers of high-quality products as marketing boons. Bloom takes this one in a comically literal spirit and imagines His Majesty (\"God. Save. Our.\" noble king, he imagines in his mind's ear) \"Sitting on his throne sucking red jujubes white.\" In Circe King Edward VII shows up doing exactly that. The fantasy is goofy but also fitting, considering Edward's insatiable appetites and copious supply of baby fat.\n Some candies, similar to gummy bears, are still sold under the name \"jujubes.\" The name goes back at least to the beginning of the 18th century, having been applied then to candies made from gum arabic, sugar, and fruits from the Ziziphus jujuba tree, called red dates, Chinese dates, or jujubes. I have not run across any records suggesting what exact sort of jujube candies might have been sold in 1904.\n Lemon's confectionery opened in 1842 and lasted well into the era of mass-produced sweets, finally going out of business in 1984. The candies were produced by its factory on Millmount Avenue in Drumcondra. Bloom thinks of \"Pineapple rock, lemon platt, butter scotch,\" the first and last of which need no explanation. Lemon platt, also mentioned in the fourth sentence of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, is glossed by Gifford as a \"Candy made of plaited sticks of lemon-flavored barley sugar,\" while Slote cites the definition in the OED: \"A flat sugar-stick, flavoured with lemon.\" \n Today, new businesses occupy all the buildings on the first block of O'Connell Street, but above the ground-floor signage for the Foot Locker at number 49 one can still see remnants of the Lemon's shopfront. A sign with several letters missing proclaims \"The Confectioners Hall,\" and a colored shield records the street number and the date of establishment. In 1988 Irish sculptor Robin Buick honored the shop with the first of 14 bronze sidewalk plaques that let pedestrians follow in Bloom's footsteps."

    "note": " Several pages into Hades, the funeral carriages cross \"The grand canal\" at Victoria Bridge. Later in the chapter, they pass over the \"Crossguns bridge: the royal canal.\" These two canals connect Dublin to the west of Ireland by way of the interior lakelands and the Rivers Shannon and Barrow.",
    "expandedNote": " The Grand Canal and its northern twin the Royal Canal were constructed in the second half of the 18th century and the first two decades of the 19th. Their long curving arms encircle central Dublin, ending near the Liffey on the eastern edge of the city. Each canal is 80-90 miles long (130-150 kilometers), with many locks. As he crosses the Crossguns bridge, Bloom thinks of \"Dropping down lock by lock to Dublin. With turf from the midland bogs.\"\n The Crossguns bridge—officially named Westmoreland Bridge when it was built, but the name didn't stick—carries \"Phibsborough Road\" over the Royal Canal, leaving metropolitan Dublin for the northern suburbs in an area long known as Crossguns. Underneath the bridge is a lock allowing canal barges to be lowered from the landward (western) level to the lower level that is maintained to the east. As the funeral carriages pass over the bridge, their occupants can see that the lock is currently in use: \"Water rushed roaring through the sluices. A man stood on his dropping barge, between clamps of turf. On the towpath by the lock a slacktethered horse.\" Several hours later, in Wandering Rocks, Father Conmee sees the same barge \"Moored under the trees of Charleville Mall,\" about a mile farther east on the Royal Canal near the crossing of the North Strand Road.\n Bloom thinks that the Royal Canal goes through Mullingar, and he could visit his daughter by walking or cycling along it. He thinks also of the foul condition of the water in the canals: \"slime, mudchoked bottles, carrion dogs.\" InIthaca he thinks of the dire \"possibility of recourse being had to the impotable water of the Grand and Royal canals as in 1893,\" Dublin currently being in the grip of a drought.\n Near the end of Wandering Rocks the viceregal cavalcade proceeds down Lower Mount Street, and then the narrative mentions an advertisement posted near \"the Royal Canal bridge.\" This must have been a slip on Joyce's part, because Mount Street Lower heads southeast from Merrion Square and crosses the Grand Canal before becoming Northumberland Road. In Hades, as the funeral carriage passes over the Royal Canal, Bloom thinks of \"James M'Cann's hobby to row me o'er the ferry.\" Here too there is a kind of conflation of the two canals, since McCann ran a fleet of boats on the Grand Canal, but in this case Joyce probably knew what he was doing, since McCann had recently died and could be supposed to live in the Glasnevin cemetery.\n Molly mentions canals several times in Penelope, without naming them. She remembers that in 1893 \"the canal was frozen.\" This must have been the Grand Canal: the canals did freeze over in February 1893, and in Hades Bloom remembers Rudy having been conceived in March or April of that year \"in Raymond Terrace,\" which lies only a few blocks away. Molly also remembers having kissed Lieutenant Stanley Gardner goodbye \"at the canal lock\" as he was about to leave for South Africa."

We know that the Clifton School where Francis Irwin briefly employed Joyce in 1904 was housed in Summerfield House, a handsome old building in rich suburban Dalkey, largely hidden from Dalkey Avenue by a high wall and shaded by mature trees. The house still stands, and the details of its exterior mentioned in the narrative correspond closely to what is there today. There are no lions, however.",
    "expandedNote": " After accepting the two copies of Mr. Deasy's letter, Stephen goes out \"by the open porch\"—a reference, apparently, to the small vestibule that juts out from the front of the house, providing some shelter from the elements for the main front door, rather than a space for sitting. Turning right, he goes \"down the gravel path under the trees\" to Dalkey Avenue. The downward-sloping path accommodates automobiles now, but it is still paved with gravel, so Stephen's short shaded walk to the gate is easy to visualize.\n As he walks, he hears \"the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield.\" This site for the boys' hockey game lies in front of the house, at the end of another short gravel path leading slightly downhill from the front door. When William York Tindall photographed it in the 1950s, it still had some of the appearance of an athletic field, with a heavy iron roller of the kind seen on grass tennis courts parked to the side in the rough. Today, this rectangle is maintained as a parklike lawn. While far short of the dimensions required for adult players, it would suffice for a boys' game. \n Passing out through the gate in the wall onto Dalkey Avenue, Stephen goes by \"The lions couchant on the pillars.\"Couchant (Old French for \"lying down\") is a term from heraldry that describes a predatory animal lying on its chest with its head raised, like those at the entrance to the New York Public Library. The two pillars of the gate remain, but the lions, which must have been considerably smaller than the NYPL's, no longer couch (or crouch) atop them.\n These many visual details can enrich a reader's impression of the closing scene of Nestor: Stephen \"turning back at the gate\" and listening to his employer's final tirade, Mr. Deasy stamping \"on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path\" as he marches back up to the house, and the sun flinging bright coins on his back \"through the checkerwork of leaves.\""

    "note": " Mulligan's \"great searching eyes\" are the first of many eyes that one becomes aware of in reading this book. Our chief physical access to most of the characters in Ulysses is through descriptions either of their clothes or of their eyes, and the eyes have it in terms of conveying information about their minds.",
    "expandedNote": " In Telemachus, Mulligan has \"great searching eyes,\" \"mobile eyes.\" Stephen's decision to disclose his grievance against Mulligan stirs \"silver points of anxiety in his eyes.\" When he is clowning, his eyes blink \"pleasantly\"; they lose all evidence of \"shrewd sense,\" \"blinking with mad gaiety.\" But Stephen sees the shrewd sense, and he discerns Mulligan's intention to claim the key: \"He will ask for it. That was in his eyes.\" He sees things in Haines' eyes as well: their \"wondering unsteady\" quality when he begins declaiming Irish to the old milkwoman; the \"firm and prudent\" quality they display as the Englishman looks out on the sea, his nation's dominion; the fact that, despite Stephen's wish to dislike the stranger, \"the cold gaze which had measured him was not all unkind.\" (In Nestor, Stephen recalls that Haines' eyes were \"unhating.\")\n Some textual controversy attends the first of these glimpses of a character's eyes. Gabler’s edition replaces “great searching eyes” with “grey searching eyes.” It is hard to prefer this change on aesthetic grounds. Losing the suggestion of intellectual spaciousness, Gabler's version gains in return only a possible symbolic suggestion that (as Gifford notes) Buck Mulligan may be similar to Athena, because she is called the “grey-eyed goddess” throughout the Odyssey. Such a correspondence appears shaky on several different grounds. The word sometimes translated as “grey-eyed” in English versions of the Odyssey, glaukopis, more properly means “with gleaming eyes.” Mulligan's eyes are described later in Telemachus as \"smokeblue\"—greyish, perhaps, but hardly grey. And even if both his and Athena's eyes are imagined to be grey, it is hard to think of Mulligan as both Stephen’s beneficent protector and his Antinous-like antagonist."

  "010032sweetmother": {
    "note": " \"Algy\" is Algernon Charles Swinburne, the ostentatiously decadent late Victorian poet from Northumberland. When Mulligan calls the sea “a great sweet mother” in Telemachus he is quoting a phrase from Swinburne’s early poem The Triumph of Time,published in 1866, which treated death at sea as a consummation devoutly to be wished.",
    "expandedNote": " The poem is a long (49 stanzas of ottava rima) lament for unrequited love. It returns again and again to the ocean as an image of the self-loss that the speaker desires, now that his hopes of romantic completion have been shipwrecked. Addressing the sea as mother and lover, killer and fulfiller, graveyard and paradise, he seeks a consummation somewhere between eroticism and mysticism:\n I will go back to the great sweet mother,\n Mother and lover of men, the sea.\n I will go down to her, I and none other, \n Close with her, kiss her and mix her with me;\n Cling to her, strive with her, hold her fast:\n O fair white mother, in days long past \n Born without sister, born without brother, \n Set free my soul as thy soul is free. \n O fair green-girdled mother of mine,\n Sea, that art clothed with the sun and the rain, \n Thy sweet hard kisses are strong like wine, \n Thy large embraces are keen like pain. \n Save me and hide me with all thy waves, \n Find me one grave of thy thousand graves, \n Those pure cold populous graves of thine\n Wrought without hand in a world without stain. . . .\n Fair mother, fed with the lives of men,\n Thou art subtle and cruel of heart, men say. \n Thou hast taken, and shalt not render again; \n Thou art full of thy dead, and cold as they. \n But death is the worst that comes of thee; \n Thou art fed with our dead, O mother, O sea,\n But when hast thou fed on our hearts? or when, \n Having given us love, hast thou taken away? \n O tender-hearted, O perfect lover, \n Thy lips are bitter, and sweet thine heart.\n The hopes that hurt and the dreams that hover, \n Shall they not vanish away and apart? \n But thou, thou art sure, thou art older than earth; \n Thou art strong for death and fruitful of birth; \n Thy depths conceal and thy gulfs discover; \n From the first thou wert; in the end thou art. (sts. 34-35, 37-38)\n With their pervasive pessimism, their extravagant longing for dissolution, their pagan ecstasies, their immersion in paradox, and their overtones of incest and necrophilia, these late Romantic stanzas speak to the avant-garde, anti-bourgeois sensibilities of men like Mulligan. Although Stephen is about as much a part of the bohemian scene as Mulligan, his hydrophobic thoughts about the sea tend more to hard-headed contemplation of rotting bodies than to dreams of watery ecstasy. But the strains of a comparable song by Shakespeare do occupy his thoughts.\n Swinburne was a friend of Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Christina Rossetti, and seen by many of his contemporaries as the late Victorian successor to Tennyson and Browning. Gifford observes that “In 1904 Swinburne was, in Yeats’ phrase, the ‘King of the Cats,’ the grand old man of the preceding century’s avant-garde.” Later in Telemachus, Mulligan recites lines from Swinburne's The Oblation, and Stephen thinks of \"Algy\" again in both Proteus and Scylla and Charybdis."

  "010142greenstone": {
    "note": " The \"smooth silver case\" in which Haines carries his cigarettes befits a man who “comes from Oxford,” and the \"green stone\" that sparkles amid the grey metal, like Ireland in the sea, symbolically suits the Englishman's status as \"the seas’ ruler.\" Haines graciously offers Stephen a cigarette from the case, his noblesse obliging him to share his wealth with the impoverished Irishman next to him, even as he apologizes for the injustices of history.",
    "expandedNote": " Joyce's choice of this image as a symbol for British imperial domination of Ireland was probably inspired by a notorious gift that King Henry II of England received in 1155 from Pope Adrian IV, a.k.a. Nicholas Breakspear, the only English cleric ever elevated to the papacy. In the work called Metalogicus, the English cleric and scholar John of Salisbury writes that he delivered to Henry the infamous bull that begins Laudabiliter, giving him temporal rule over Ireland, along with a gold ring containing an emerald stone to signify the overlordship. The history of this exchange (as well as the authenticity of Laudabiliter) is murky and contested, but Oxen of the Sun shows that Joyce knew of the bull, and also of the story of the ring: \"It is that same bull that was sent to our island by farmer Nicholas, the bravest cattle breeder of them all, with an emerald ring in his nose.\"\n In an essay titled Fenianism: The Last Fenian (1907) Joyce wrote sardonically, \"But the Pope meant nothing discourteous by this. Anyhow the Irish are so accommodatingly affable that they would hardly even grumble if tomorrow, owing to some unforeseen complication in Europe, the Pope having already given it to an Englishman, were to hand their island over to some temporarily unemployed hidalgo from the court of Alphonso.\"\n The green stone from Stephen's first chapter makes an interesting return in Bloom's first chapter, reappearing in the face of Bloom's cat: \"He watched the dark eyeslits narrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones.\" Perhaps the most important word here is \"greed\": the cat's hunger seems to draw the English lust for conquest and colonial exploitation back into the narrative."

  "080027greenhouses": {
    "note": " In Lestrygonians, thinking that \"All kinds of places are good for ads,\" Bloom approves of the cleverness of placing gonorrhea treatment posters in a place where men experience the effects of the disease: \"That quack doctor for the clap used to be stuck up in all the greenhouses.\" Greenhouses were public urinals sited at heavily trafficked spots on Dublin's streets. The name, now long forgotten, derived from the fact that these structures were painted green. Although intended only for men (letters above the entrance, visible in the second photograph shown here, said \"GENTLEMEN ONLY\"), Molly once used one in an emergency. Another shows up in Wandering Rocks, possibly as an occasion for anti-imperial mockery only two sentences after a similar insult involving sewers.",
    "expandedNote": " Richard Wall documented this sense of \"greenhouse\" in An Anglo-Irish Dialect Glossary for Joyce's Works (1987), A Dictionary and Glossary for the Irish Literary Revival (1995), and An Irish Literary Dictionary and Glossary (2001). In his Dictionary of Hiberno-English (2004), Terence Dolan quotes from the last of these, which says that the name referred to \"the hexagonal, green, cast-iron public urinals, which were once part of Dublin's street furniture.\" Wall is almost certainly wrong about the hexagonal shape—photographs show that the structures were octagonal—but he is almost certainly correct about the color. Present-day confirmation of that can be found on Horfield Common in Bristol, England. There, just off Gloucester Road at the end of a concrete path, stands an ornately decorated, Victorian-era iron urinal, this one round, that is painted a bright shade of green. While new paint was no doubt applied recently, it presumably may have been chosen to match what came before. A photograph of one of the Dublin urinals on Ormond Quay, taken in the days of color film, shows that it too was painted green. \n In Penelope, Molly's thoughts about penises lead her to male exhibitionism and thence to greenhouses: \"that disgusting Cameron highlander behind the meat market or that other wretch with the red head behind the tree where the statue of the fish used to be when I was passing pretending he was pissing standing out for me to see it with his babyclothes up to one side the Queens own they were a nice lot its well the Surreys relieved them theyre always trying to show it to you every time nearly I passed outside the mens greenhouse near the Harcourt street station just to try some fellow or other trying to catch my eye as if it was 1 of the 7 wonders of the world O and the stink of those rotten places the night coming home with Poldy after the Comerfords party oranges and lemonade to make you feel nice and watery I went into 1 of them it was so biting cold I couldnt keep it when was that 93 the canal was frozen yes it was a few months after a pity a couple of the Camerons werent there to see me squatting in the mens place meadero.\" (\"Meadero\" is a Spanish word for urinal. The \"Camerons,\" or \"The Queens own,\" were the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders, an infantry regiment.)\n Molly seems to have experienced some curiosity about what the greenhouse experience was like. (Does \"just to try,\" at the end of the first boldfaced passage above, refer to her desire to peek inside, or is it somehow syntactically connected to men \"trying to catch my eye\"?) But her strongest response is to \"the stink of those rotten places,\" which she associates with men's \"disgusting\" desire to display their sexual organs to total strangers. It would appear that, in the strongly homosocial environment of 1904 Dublin, men often did not bother to completely button up before leaving the confines of the convenience. \n Perhaps some connection is implied to the strange moment in Wandering Rocks when Stephen's father confronts the viceregal cavalcade passing by him on Ormond Quay: \"On Ormond quay Mr Simon Dedalus, steering his way from the greenhouse for the subsheriff's office, stood still in midstreet and brought his hat low. His Excellency graciously returned Mr Dedalus' greeting.\" The phrase \"brought his hat low\" could describe Simon extravagantly doffing his hat, or perhaps making a deep bow. But would this passionate nationalist ever make such a gesture of obeisance? \n It could perhaps be claimed that Simon salutes the viceroy in a spirit of sarcastic mockery (your LORDship) or of resigned cynicism (when in Rome...), but in James Joyce's Ireland, David Pierce suggests a different way of understanding the gesture. He notes that \"The plebeian Joyce took delight in associating the British Establishment with the urinal,\" notably in the bizarre detail of Edward VII's bucket in Circe. Simon is coming \"from the greenhouse,\" a structure which did in fact stand on the river's edge of Ormond Quay as one of the photographs here shows. Pierce's comical take is that Simon \"has forgotten to button his trousers\" and bends over to remedy the problem, but the Lord Lieutenant \"assumes that one of his subjects is showing respect and returns the greeting. Across the colonial divide, even basic signs get misread\" (105). \n The practice of giving urban men places to relieve their bladders, at a time when people moved about by foot and indoor toilets were rare, apparently started in Paris. According to a page on the Old Dublin Town website (www.olddublintown.com), they were informally called pissoirs but the \"official name was vespasiennes, named after the first century Roman emperor Vespasianus, who put a tax on urine collected from public toilets and used for tanning leather.\" Introduced in 1841 by Claude-Philibert Barthelot, comte de Rambuteau, the Prefet of the former Départment of the Seine, the first pissoirs had a simple cylindrical shape and were often called colonnes Rambuteau. \"In 1877 they were replaced by multi-compartmented structures, referred to as vespasiennes. At the peak of their spread in the 1930s there were 1,230 pissoirs in Paris,\" but then came a steady decline until in 2006 only one remained. \n From Paris the practice spread to Berlin, which held architectural competitions in 1847, 1865 and 1877 to choose designs different from the Parisian pissoirs. The Old Dublin Town site notes that \"One of the most successful types was an octagonal structure with seven stalls, first built in 1879. Their number increased to 142 by 1920.\" Something like this design must have been adopted in Oslo as well, judging by a Norwegian witticism that Ole Martin Halck has mentioned to me in a personal communication. One of the circus companies that regularly visited Oslo after the city constructed a permanent building in 1890 was called Cirkus Schumann, after its German/Danish founding family. There was a urinal in Oslo's central square, Stortorget, that was vaguely round and had a capacity of seven men (\"sju mann\"), so this structure too came to be called the Cirkus Sjumann.\n Precise dates are harder to come by for cities in the UK, and in Dublin the available historical record seems to be almost entirely photographic. The Old Dublin Town page says that French-style urinals arrived \"prior to the 1932 Eucharistic Congress, as part of a 'clean up Dublin' campaign,\" and in The Encyclopaedia of Dublin Bennett notes that \"In 1932, several ornamental cast-iron pissoirs were imported from France and erected on the Quays\" for that occasion (95). But Joyce's novel makes clear that they were present much earlier. Vincent Altman O'Connor suggests that pissoirs may also have been erected for the same purpose (cleaning up a dirty old town) before one of the visits of King Edward VII, who came to Dublin in 1868, 1885, and 1903.\n Numerous photos document the presence of greenhouses in Dublin. At least five images of the pissoir on Ormond Quay survive, including the color photograph displayed here. As the poster for The Eagles on its river side suggests, this fixture lasted into the 1970s, when the Dublin Corporation sold it to a student for £10. It ended up converted into a gazebo in someone's back yard in Sandymount."

    "note": " A second character from Dubliners appears in Calypso when Molly asks her husband, \"What had Gretta Conroy on?\" Gabriel and Gretta Conroy are the principal characters of \"The Dead,\" the novella-length story that concludes Dubliners. Later, Bloom thinks briefly of Gabriel and of his Aunt Julia, one of two maiden aunts who figure prominently in the story. Stephen remembers the other aunt, who was his godmother. The novel also frequently mentions a \"Father Conroy\" who may or may not be Gabriel's brother Constantine.",
    "expandedNote": " \"The Dead\" (written in 1907) was Joyce's first fictional attempt to represent a man's anxiety about the fidelity of his spouse, followed by the play Exiles (finished in 1915) and then Ulysses (published in 1922). Given the adultery plot set in motion in Calypso, it is interesting that one of the first resurrections of a character from Dubliners takes the form of Molly thinking of Gretta. Gretta's spouse enters the novel not too long afterward, when Bloom thinks in Aeolus of J. J. O'Molloy doing \"some literary work for the Expresswith Gabriel Conroy.\" The Daily Express was a unionist Irish newspaper, and in \"The Dead\" Gabriel had endured some uncomfortable taunting from a Miss Molly Ivors, who called him a \"West Briton\" for associating himself with that conservative \"rag.\"\n We know that some time has passed between the events represented in \"The Dead\" and those of Ulysses because Gabriel's Aunt Julia has died. In the novella she performed at the holiday gathering, singing Arrayed for the Bridal. Although the song's subject matter clashed grotesquely with her frail appearance, her technique was excellent, and \"To follow the voice, without looking at the singer’s face, was to feel and share the excitement of swift and secure flight.\" In Lestrygonians Bloom remembers Julia performing a different song: \"There is not in this wide world a vallee. Great song of Julia Morkan's. Kept her voice up to the very last. Pupil of Michael Balfe's, wasn't she?\" \n Stephen, it turns out, has a very close connection to the household represented in the novella: in Ithaca he thinks of \"his godmother Miss Kate Morkan in the house of her dying sister Miss Julia Morkan at 15 Usher's Island.\" \n Gerty MacDowell thinks repeatedly in Nausicaa of a \"Father Conroy\" who is the curate in charge of the \"Mary, star of the sea\" church in Sandymount. This was also Paddy Dignam's parish church, as evidenced by his son's thought of the same priest in Wandering Rocks: \"That was Mr Dignam, my father. I hope he's in purgatory now because he went to confession to Father Conroy on Saturday night.\" It is tempting to ask whether Father Conroy may be Gabriel's brother, since \"The Dead\" mentions that \"Constantine was now senior curate in Balbriggan,\" a town just 20 miles north of central Dublin, and some time has passed. \n Gifford's research would seem to quash that speculation: he notes that the actual curate of Star of the Sea in 1904 was Father Bernard Conroy, who lived at 5 Leahy's Terrace. But in Nausicaa, after all of Gerty's thoughts of the good Father, Bloom observes, \"Yes, there's the light in the priest's house. Their frugal meal. . . . Gabriel Conroy's brother is curate.\" Joyce appears to have deliberately blurred the lines between fact and fiction. Did he seize upon the coincidence of the curates' names to evict the real Conroy and install his own? Or is Bloom confusing his Conroys, as other Dubliners confuse him with Bloom the dentist? \n An observation of Ellmann's suggests still another, bizarre possibility: \"Joyce deliberately confuses Joseph Bloom the dentist with Leopold in one chapter, and in another he lists as one of Leopold's old addresses 38 Lombard Street, which was actually Joseph Bloom's address.\""

  "010048greypants": {
    "note": " Rejecting the offer of some new pants, Stephen tells Mulligan, \"I can't wear them if they are grey.\" He is rigidly upholding an outdated Victorian convention, no doubt because of the terrible guilt that he feels about his mother's death. And he is becoming Hamlet, in a symbolic costume display that will ally him with Bloom.",
    "expandedNote": " Gifford notes that “In the mid-Victorian world, the period of a son’s deep mourning for his mother (black suit, shoes, socks, and tie and a sharply limited social life) would have been a year and a day. By 1904 the rules had been considerably relaxed, but Stephen is adhering to the letter of the old law.” We learn in Ithaca that Stephen's mother was buried on 26 June 1903, so only a few more days remain before the old custom will allow Stephen to “go into ‘second mourning’ (gray would be acceptable).”\n To this realistic explanation Joyce adds a symbolic parallel. Stephen’s insistence on dressing in formal mourning attire when others in his world recommend moving on with life likens him to Hamlet. The contrast, later in Telemachus, between his mourning clothes and the “gay attires” of Mulligan and Haines furthers this resemblance, since Hamlet first appears in a scene of high court ceremony where everyone else is dressed festively to celebrate marriage and dynastic stability, and his mother urges him to \"cast thy nighted colour off.\" Mulligan's mocking rebuke—\"Etiquette is etiquette. He kills his mother but he can't wear grey trousers\"—further allies him with Gertrude and Claudius.\n As Bloom walks down the sunny side of the street in Calypso he thinks, \"Be a warm day I fancy. Specially in these black clothes feel it more. . . . But I couldn't go in that light suit. Make a picnic of it.\" His scrupulous adherence to the customs of mourning (he will be attending Paddy Dignam's funeral later in the morning) associates him with Stephen, and throughout the day the two men will be dressed alike. The implicit allusion to Hamlet invests the physical resemblance with a symbolic suggestion that both men are outsiders, skeptical and alienated. It also contributes to the idea that they may somehow play the roles of father and son."

The ocean currents lapping at its shores and the rain constantly threatening to pour from its skies mean that the island is indeed \"washed by the gulfstream.\"",

    "note": " Episode 6, \"Hades,\" takes place as Proteus does from 11 AM to noon. (Here, the Gilbert schema is clearly preferable to the Linati.) Bloom gets into a funeral carriage with three other men in the near southeastern suburb of Sandymount, rides through the city center to the near northwestern suburb of Glasnevin, enters Prospect Cemetery, and attends the Catholic rites for Paddy Dignam, a man he knew only slightly. His fixation on death and disintegration in this chapter recalls Stephen's similar thoughts in Proteus, as does his distinctly non-Christian slant on the subject. Allusions to ancient epic accounts of the underworld are woven throughout, echoing Bloom's pagan thoughts.",
    "expandedNote": " In his detailed Linati schema, Joyce listed more Homeric \"Persons\" for Hades than for any other chapter of Ulysses, suggesting (even if one does not assume significant modern correspondences for all of them) an intense engagement with the Odyssey. The story runs as follows: In book 10 Circe advises Odysseus to sail his ship far north to a shore where four rivers (Pyriphlegethon, Cocytus, Styx, and Acheron) flow. There he is to dig a small square pit and fill it with the blood of two sheep, which will attract the shades of Hades. The Homeric dead are pale shadows of living people eager for the life-giving force of hot blood, as Bloom thinks in Lestrygonians: \"Hot fresh blood they prescribe for decline. Blood always needed. Insidious. Lick it up smokinghot, thick sugary. Famished ghosts.\" Odysseus gathers his men to carry out the fearsome task, but before they can leave Circe's palace one of them, Elpenor, slips from the roof of the palace, where he fell asleep after drinking too much wine, and breaks his neck. In book 11, after Circe's directions are fulfilled, Elpenor's shade comes forward, tells Odysseus his story, and receives the promise of a decent burial. The hero then encounters many other shades that come crowding around the bloody pit. \n Hades echoes many visual details of Book 11, as well as some from Virgil's imitative Aeneid and Dante's classically oriented Inferno. As the funeral procession moves through Dublin it crosses four bodies of water (\"Dodder bridge,\" \"The Grand Canal,\" \"the Liffey,\" \"the royal canal\") that recall the four Homeric rivers, as well as similar waters in Virgil and Dante. The marble shapes in the stone-cutter's yard next to the cemetery evoke the shades crowding around Odysseus at the pit, appealing to be heard: \"Crowded on the spit of land silent shapes appeared, white, sorrowful, holding out calm hands, knelt in grief, pointing. Fragments of shapes, hewn. In white silence: appealing.\" Inside the cemetery, Bloom's \"How many! All these here once walked round Dublin\" vividly recalls Dante's \"I could not believe / death had undone so many\" (Inferno 3.56-57). (In The Waste Land T. S. Eliot imitated Joyce's imitation of Dante, seeing the multitudes of the medieval underworld in the crowds walking around a modern city: \"A crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many, / I had not thought death had undone so many.\") \n The \"Gloomy gardens\" and \"dismal fields\" in Joyce's text recall the Lugentes campi (fields of mourning) of Virgil's unhappy lovers (Aeneid 6.440). As the chapter ends, Bloom sees that \"The gates glimmered in front: still open. Back to the world again,\" echoing the \"two gates of Sleep\" which confront Aeneas at the end of book 6, through one of which he goes back to the world again. Still another Virgilian echo occurs when Simon Dedalus describes Mulligan as his son's \"fidus Achates.\" The phrase \"faithful Achates\" used at Aeneid 1.118 names a loyal friend of Aeneas, and Simon intends merely a scornful contrast to Mulligan. But at 6.47-52, Achates and Deiphobe appear as the advance party that has prepared the way for Aeneas to descend into the underworld. \n Many of Joyce's characters are plainly linked with Homeric models. Paddy Dignam's alcoholic death (\"Blazing face: redhot. Too much John Barleycorn\") recalls Elpenor's. Simon Dedalus' pride in Stephen (\"Full of his son. He is right. Something to hand on\") recalls the joy of Achilles when Odysseus tells him how well Neoptolemus spoke and fought in the Trojan campaign. The married caretaker John O'Connell prompts Bloom to wonder how any woman could ever have been persuaded to live in a cemetery: \"Fancy being his wife. Wonder how he had the gumption to propose to any girl. Come out and live in the graveyard. Dangle that before her.\" In the Odyssey no persuasion was involved: Hades raped Persephone, tearing her away from the sunshine and carrying her down into his gloomy world. \n The echoes go on and on. Bloom's thoughts about his dead father correspond to Odysseus' conversation with his dead mother. The silent snubbing that Bloom receives from John Henry Menton resembles the moment when Ajax silently snubs Odysseus. The Gilbert schema also suggests correspondences between Parnell and Agamemnon (great leaders of nations) and between Daniel O'Connell and Hercules (great heroes). Many readers have detected other equivalences, with varying degrees of plausibility. \n Several mythological figures from ancient epic underworlds also figure in Joyce's chapter. Martin Cunningham's marital situation presents a modern version of the stone-rolling Sisyphus: \"And that awful drunkard of a wife of his. Setting up house for her time after time and then pawning the furniture on him every Saturday almost. Leading him the life of the damned. Wear the heart out of a stone, that. Monday morning. Start afresh. Shoulder to the wheel.\" Another figure of eternal punishment, Tantalus, who is tortured by fruit that he can never eat and water that he can never drink, comes up when Bloom thinks that seeing lovers nearby would be \"Tantalising for the poor dead. Smell of grilled beefsteaks to the starving,\" and again when he thinks of \"Tantalus glasses.\" The three-headed dog Cerberus, who guards the entrance to the underworld, takes the modern form of the priest Father Coffey. \"Bully about the muzzle he looks,\" thinks Bloom, \"with a belly on him like a poisoned pup.\"\n These many precise echoes weave a fabric of pagan antiquity around the Christian cemetery and its rites, paralleling Bloom's skepticism about a heavenly home. One strong influence from the ancient epics is the sense of ghostly insubstantiality that they attach to the dead. Circe calls the people that Odysseus will meet \"the faint dead,\" and Book 11 describes Erebus as a place where the \"dimwitted dead are camped forever, / the after-images of used-up men.\" Odysseus learns that at death \"dreamlike the soul flies, insubstantial,\" and Tiresias tells him that the dead crave the blood in the pit because it will give them a brief substantiality: \"Any dead man / whom you allow to enter where the blood is / will speak to you, and speak the truth; but those / deprived will grow remote again and fade.\" The desperate enervation of this place receives supremely dramatic expression when the great conqueror of men, Achilles, tells Odysseus that he would rather \"break sod as a farm hand / for some poor country man, on iron rations, / than lord it over all the exhausted dead.\" \n Virgil retained the outlines of Homer's underworld while adding features that Greek eschatology had only dimly forecast: rewards for well-led lives, torments for wickedness, a fully fleshed theory of reincarnation. In Dante's afterlife, where punishment and reward swell to govern the entire conception, reincarnation is anathema and there can be no thought of the mundane world being more real than heaven and hell. Still, his damned souls do have some of the desperate insubstantiality of Homer's dead. Even those who endure no physical torments suffer from awareness that they eternally lack the presence of God, and Farinata explains that the damned possess \"the mighty Ruler's light\" only in being able to see the future; they are blind to the present, so when time ends and only the present moment exists, \"all our knowledge will perish\" (10.100-8). \n Readers can form their own judgements about the relevance of these various afterlives to Bloom's mortuary reveries. But it is unquestionable that, like Achilles, Bloom prizes life in the flesh over the shadowy, uncertain, decaying facsimiles of life beyond the grave. \"There is another world after death named hell,\" he thinks. \"I do not like that other world she wrote. No more do I. Plenty to see and hear and feel yet. Feel live warm beings near you. Let them sleep in their maggoty beds. They are not going to get me this innings. Warm beds: warm fullblooded life.\" The priest's \"In paradisum\" means nothing to Bloom: \"Tiresome kind of a job. But he has to say something.\" Reincarnation makes somewhat more sense: \"If we were all suddenly somebody else.\" But what makes most sense is that the heart stops beating, the body falls apart, the person vanishes, and loved ones start forgetting you.\n The oblivion is not total, however. Like the insubstantial shades of former human beings that populate Homer's underworld, the dead in Hades live on in ghostly simulacra, poignant recollections, proud memorials, and loving wishes. Monuments to great men line the route of the procession from just below O'Connell Street to its very end. The palliative fiction of people lying at rest in the graveyard generates Thornton Wilder-like fancies about their ongoing life: \"The dead themselves the men anyhow would like to hear an odd joke or the women to know what's in fashion.\" Photographs and voice recordings can perpetuate memories of lost loved ones: \"After dinner on a Sunday. Put on poor old greatgrandfather. Kraahraark! Hellohellohello amawfullyglad kraark awfullygladaseeagain hellohello amawf krpthsth. Remind you of the voice like the photograph reminds you of the face. Otherwise you couldn't remember the face after fifteen years, say.\" Perhaps there are even actual ghosts walking among us, as the mysterious man in the macintosh does in the Glasnevin cemetery.\n The most enduring effect of Hades, remarkably similar to the one created by the ending of The Dead, is a suggestion that the dead are never completely erased from the world of the living, and the living never completely escape the dead's capacity for diminishment, loss, and ghostly insubstantiality. The sixth chapter of Ulysses abounds with language of life-in-death and death-in-life, limning a border that Joyce would explore again in Finnegans Wake. Another pervasive linguistic feature is the repetition (totaling 23 times) of the word \"heart,\" which both schemas identify as the \"organ\" of Hades. The cessation of this organ's beating signifies the end of life. Its yearnings create the human condition defined in Yeats' Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen: \"Man is in love, and loves what vanishes, / What more is there to say?\""

    "note": " Just as Joyce modeled Mulligan on his friend Gogarty, he modeled \"Haines\" on Gogarty’s other guest in the tower, a well-off young Hiberno-English scholar named Richard Samuel Chenevix Trench who was born in 1881, one year before Joyce. Gogarty met Trench during a term at Oxford in early 1904, a fact which accounts for Mulligan's referring to \"the oxy chap downstairs.\" In 1909, following an unhappy love affair, Trench killed himself with a handgun—perhaps the same one that terrorized Joyce in the middle of the night.",
    "expandedNote": " Haine is French for “hate.” Haines’ Englishness provides one possible basis for hearing his name as an indictment, but late in Telemachus Stephen sees that as Haines looks at him his gaze is \"not all unkind,\" and in Nestor he thinks again that Haines' eyes were \"unhating.\" So if we are to hear Haines' name as an indication that he is a hater, it appears to have more to do with the revelation, a few moments after Stephen's realization that Haines does not hate him, that the Englishman is anti-Semitic. In Scylla and Charybdis, Joyce will show thatMulligan too is anti-Semitic, though perhaps he has only flippantly picked up the affectation from Haines.\n The friendship of Gogarty and Trench represented a kind of cross-Irish Sea chiasmus. Though settled in England, Trench’s family was Anglo-Irish, and Gogarty’s Catholic family moved in Dublin’s Anglo-Irish elite. Gogarty met Trench through the Oxford Gaelic Society, where both of them were learning Irish. After Gogarty returned to complete his degree at Trinity College Dublin, Trench reciprocated by visiting Ireland in September 1904. Into this insular harmony, Joyce interjected the continental dissonance of naming him Haines. In Circe, Mulligan celebrates a Black Mass assisted by \"The Reverend Mr Hugh C Haines Love M. A.\" Haines here has become conflated with the Reverend Hugh C. Love, an entirely different (but similarly Protestant, upper-crusty, well-meaning, and insensitive) personage in the novel. The juxtaposition of their two names produces the meaning Hate Love. \n Trench was an enthusiast proponent of the Gaelic League cause of reviving Irish language and native Irish culture. Although English friends called him Samuel, he asked to be called Dermot (Diarmuid) in Ireland, and in 1905 he legally added Dermot to his string of names. Under this name he wrote a short work called What is the Use of Reviving Irish?, published in 1907 by a Dublin printer. A copy of the pamphlet, seen in the image accompanying this note, is held in the Joyce Museum housed in the Martello tower at Sandycove. Trench’s third cousin once removed, an Irishman named C. E. F. (Chalmers) Trench, wrote an article titled “Dermot Chenevix Trench and Haines of Ulysses,” published in JJQ 13 (1975): 39-48, which makes clear how deeply passionate was Trench’s commitment to the cause of resuscitating the Irish language.\n Another Trench, Richard Chenevix (1807-86), whose relation to Richard Samuel Chenevix I do not know, was a poet and philologist who became the Archbishop of Dublin in 1864. His four published works on linguistic topics—On the Study of Words (1851), On the Lessons in Proverbs (1853), English Past and Present (1855), and A Select Glossary (1860)—were evidently important to Joyce when he was writing Oxen of the Sun. In \"Richard Chenevix Trench and Joyce's Historical Study of Words,\" Joyce Studies Annual 9 (1998), Gregory Downing argues that the elder Trench gave Joyce his notion that language develops organically. Sarah Davison cites Downing's work in \"Joyce's Incorporation of Literary Sources in Oxen of the Sun,\"Genetic Joyce Studies 9 (2009), asserting \"with confidence\" that The Study of Words influenced the composittion of Oxen."

    "expandedNote": " If he aided the tourist by contributing to his literary work (call it, say, Collected Utterances of an Authentic Irishman), Stephen would be doing so primarily with the aggressive intent of breaking through Haines' smug insensibility (\"Tonight deftly amid wild drink and talk, to pierce the polished mail of his mind\"), but the effect would be only to prostitute his artistic gifts to the English people's appropriating acceptance (\"A jester at the court of his master, indulged and disesteemed, winning a clement master's praise\"). Stephen reflects that many Irish writers have been willing to adopt the role of entertaining eccentric: \"Why had they chosen all that part? Not wholly for the smooth caress. For them too history was a tale like any other too often heard, their land a pawnshop.\"\n Declan Kiberd writes perceptively about this \"general tradition of Anglo-Irish comedy in England from Congreve to Shaw (who described himself jokingly as 'a faithful servant of the English people'). Joyce cast Wilde as 'court jester to the English,' who had a fatal propensity to turn any Irish artist into a mere entertainer. Haines's notebook represents a worrying reimportation of that tradition back into the colony, the 'pawn-shop' where everything is owned by someone living elsewhere and where all ideas come second-hand. Joyce sees the Irish reputation for wit and eloquence as an attempt to compensate for colonial oppression and material failure.\"\n In Proteus, Stephen will return once more to this question, comparing his literary co-optation to the schemes of various noble \"pretenders\" to occupy the throne of England: \"For that are you pining, the bark of their applause? Pretenders: live their lives.\""

As he puts it in the preceding sentences of Lotus Eaters, \"Chemists rarely move. Their green and gold beaconjars too heavy to stir.\" Hamilton Long's may not have been around since the landing on Mount Ararat, but they have certainly stayed put, doing business at multiple locations in the Dublin area to the present day."

  "080014hanched": {
    "note": " As Bloom takes a bite of his gorgonzola sandwich, the \"yellow blobs\" of mustard under the cheese declare their potency: \"A warm shock of air heat of mustard hanched on Mr Bloom's heart.\" \"Hanch\" is a rare verb from the British Isles (Gifford calls it \"Scots dialect\") that means to snap at noisily and greedily. The OED's definition is vivid: \"To snatch, snap at, or bite with violent or noisy action of the jaws; said of large dogs, wild beasts, cannibals, or greedy men.\"",
    "expandedNote": " It perfectly suits the omnivoracious imagery of Lestrygonians to make a sandwich snap at the person eating it. And the conceit is not really all that fantastic: since plants cannot move to escape the creatures trying to eat them, they have evolved the defense mechanism of toxic chemicals that bite back when an animal takes a bite, causing it acute pain or discomfort. In mustards, the chemical is allyl isothiocyanate, a volatile organosulfuric compound produced when a herbivore chews on the plant and breaks its seeds. This oil is harmful to the plant itself, so it is produced only when the grinding of a seed makes an enzyme combine with another chemical. \n One could argue that \"hanched on Mr Bloom's heart\" also does a decent job of evoking human physiological responses to hot mustard seeds. The aerosolized AITC chiefly assaults tiny pores in cells of the nose, eyes, and sinuses, but its gripping pains are also felt in the throat and bronchial passages, which might metaphorically be expressed as something snapping at the heart. \n § All texts of the novel before Gabler's, beginning with the first edition in 1922, had \"hauched.\" There is no such verb in the English lexicon. If this error of a typist or printer were amended to \"haunched,\" very different bodily metaphorics would result: a warm shock of air sat down heavily on Mr. Bloom's heart, like thighs and buttocks pressing on him. But no published text contains this word, and Joyce's handwriting in the Rosenbach manuscript can only be read as \"u\" or \"n,\" not \"un.\" Readers should almost certainly go with Gabler's team and hear mustard hanching at Bloom's heart."

  "030144handmaid": {
    "note": " Having associated the gypsy woman with the sun and with the biblical figure of Eve, Stephen begins to link her with the moon and with Mary, the mother of Jesus. Walking \"to the west,\" she joins with the moon in pulling after her the incoming, westward-flowing tide: \"A tide westering, moondrawn, in her wake. Tides, myriadislanded, within her, blood not mine.\" This makes the dark woman the moon's helper, in parody of a Catholic prayer to the Virgin Mary: \"Behold the handmaid of the moon.\"",
    "expandedNote": " The Angelus prayer celebrates the Annunciation, when the archangel Gabriel told Mary that she would bear the son of God. It begins Angelus Domini nuntiavit Mariae, \"The angel of the Lord announced to Mary,\" and contains the verse Ecce ancilla Domini, \"Behold the handmaid of the Lord.\" Mary speaks these words to the angel in Luke 1:38, signifying her submission to the will of God. The prayer has traditionally been recited at 6 AM, 12 noon, and 6 PM, not only in monasteries, convents, and churches but also by ordinary people during their workdays (as in Millet's painting of French peasants), so it seems natural that it comes into Stephen's thoughts at the hour of noon.\n It is less clear why he should be calling a gypsy woman the handmaid of the moon—if I am correct in thinking that he is. Gifford asserts that \"The sea (the 'mighty mother') is, of course, the 'handmaid of the moon'.\" But although this accords with scientific reality (the waters of the sea follow the tugging pull of the moon), it makes no sense in the context of the paragraph. For several sentences, \"she\" has trudged across the sands of the world, dragging her load, with a tide \"in her wake,\" and she has tides \"within her,\" identified as \"blood.\" How could a tide pull a tide in its wake? How could it have tides within it? Why should they be thought of as blood? The much more reasonable interpretation is that the woman who is walking west across the sands, dragging her load, also fancifully pulls the tide behind her, and contains tides of pulsing blood within her.\n Should Stephen's noontide devotion to the dark-skinned traveler be read sarcastically? His fantasy of her nighttime activities in Fumbally's Lane shows that he thinks her anything but a blessed virgin. Or might some real sense of reverence inhere in his parody? His thoughts of the \"blood not mine\" do not betray misogynist or racist contempt. She is \"myriadislanded,\" an unknown universe passing parallel to his own."

  "010041killergod": {
    "note": " To Mulligan's charge in Telemachus that Stephen killed his mother, Stephen replies, “Someone killed her.” This exchange initiates a thread that runs throughout the novel. If God is to be understood as a creator who brings life into the world, he should also be understood as a butcher who takes it away.",
    "expandedNote": " Stephen is, it seems, capable of scientific thinking. In Circe he responds directly and reasonably to Mulligan's cruel remark: “They say I killed you, mother. He offended your memory. Cancer did it, not I. Destiny.” But as a metaphysician he cannot accept the shallow Christian view of God's unalloyed goodness. In Scylla and Charybdis he refers to a deity “whom the most Roman of catholics call dio boia, hangman god,” which Gifford notes is \"a common Roman expression for the force that frustrates human hopes and destinies.\" This god is quite literally a \"butcher.\" \n Bloom too thinks, in Lestrygonians, that “God wants blood victim.” That is, after all, the whole logic of the Incarnation, the crucifixion, the Last Supper. The YMCA throwaway that he is reading asks, \"Are you saved?\" and it describes the immersion by which we can be saved: \"All are washed in the blood of the lamb.\" \n In Oxen of the Sun a narrative voice modeled on the scientific writing of Thomas Henry Huxley proclaims that Stephen's view \"that an omnivorous being which can masticate, deglute, digest and apparently pass through the ordinary channel with pluterperfect imperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous females emaciated by parturition, corpulent professional gentlemen, not to speak of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns, might possibly find gastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob, reveals as nought else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above alluded to.\" The tendency alluded to earlier in the paragraph was Mr. Dedalus' \"perverted transcendentalism.\" \n In other words God, in Stephen's highly \"unsavoury\" view, is an omnivore who chews through every variety of human meat, pausing occasionally to cleanse his palate with the delicate juices of \"staggering bob.\" The narrator pauses to gloss this last dish: \"For the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately acquainted with the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this morbidminded esthete and embryo philosopher who for all his overweening bumptiousness in things scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid from an alkali prides himself on being, it should perhaps be stated that staggering bob in the vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed victuallers signifies the cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly dropped from its mother.\" YHWH here transcends his familiar aspect of murderous senile delinquent and becomes a ravening, gluttonous, red-toothed carnivore.\n All of this can be dismissed as the ravings of a tortured apostate, but Stephen's fanciful metaphysics complement the scientific vision that pervades Ulysses: human life is lived in bodies, bodies are perishable meat, and no one knows what survives the grave. Bloom thinks along these lines throughout Hades, ignoring all the pious cant about the afterlife and focusing on the facts of life (worth holding onto) and death (not worth thinking about for very long). \n Mulligan seconds his opinions in Telemachus: \"You saw only your mother die. I see them pop off every day in theMater and Richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom. It's a beastly thing and nothing else. It simply doesn't matter.\"\n [2014] A less materialist inspiration for Stephen's view of the deity may perhaps be found in the works of William Blake. Thornton cites a passage from A Vision of the Last Judgment: \"Thinking as I do that the Creator of this World is a very Cruel Being, & being a Worshipper of Christ, I cannot help saying: 'the Son O how unlike the Father!' First God Almighty comes with a Thump on the Head. Then Jesus Christ comes with a balm to heal it'\" (28)."

  "030104hannigan": {
    "note": " The thought of Mulligan's disapproving aunt turns Stephen's mind to a popular song about another guardian aunt in the similar-sounding Hannigan family. By playing the tune in his head, he subverts Mulligan's elitist family snobbism with a low-life, rowdy ballad, just as he subverted Garrett Deasy's upper-crust family mythology with a rousing ballad of the Catholic peasantry.",
    "expandedNote": " The song was written by Percy French (1854-1920), a well-born Anglo-Irishman who took up song-writing after graduating from Trinity College, Dublin with a degree in engineering. Several of French's compositions, including Phil the Fluther's Ball and The Mountains of Mourne, have become fixtures in Ireland's folk-song tradition. \n Here is the text of \"Mat Hannigan's Aunt,\" from The Songs of Percy French (Ossian, 1986). The sardonic last stanza insinuates the speaker's true feelings about the domineering old woman.\n Oh! Mat Hannigan had an Aunt,\n An Uncle too, likewise; \n But in this chant, 'tis Hannigan's Aunt\n I wish to eulogize.\n For when young lovers came\n And axed her to be theirs,\nMat Hannigan's Aunt took each gallant, \nAnd fir'd him down the stairs.\n (Chorus)\n So here's a health to Hannigan's Aunt!\n I'll tell you the reason why, \n She always had things dacent\n In the Hannigan family; \n A platther an' can for ev'ry man,\n \"What more did the quality want?\n You've yer bite an' yer sup, what's cockin' yees up!' \n Says Mathew Hannigan’s Aunt.\n Oh! she never would raise her voice,\n She never was known to scold,\n But when Hannigan’s Aunt sed, “No, you can’t,”\n You did what you were told;\n And if anyone answered back,\n Oh, then his hair she'd comb,\n “For all I want,” sez Hannigan’s aunt,\n “Is peace in our happy home.” \n (Chorus)\n Oh, when she went to Court,\n The A-de-congs in vain\n Would fume and rant, for Hannigan’s Aunt\n Said, “Boy, let go me thrain!”\n And when the Lard Leftinant\n A kiss on her brow would imprint!\n “Oh no, you can’t,” said Hannigan’s Aunt\n “Widout me pa’s consint.”\n (Chorus)\n Oh, ‘tis often we’d praise her up,\n We’d laud her to the sky,\n We’d all descant on Hannigan’s Aunt\n And hope she never would die.\n But still I’d like to add—\n If Hannigan isn’t about—\n That whin we plant Mat Hannigan’s Aunt,\n We won’t be too put out.\n (Chorus) \n The allusion was first identified in Matthew Hodgart and Mabel Worthington's Song in the Works of James Joyce (Columbia UP, 1959). In Musical Allusions in the Works of James Joyce: Early Poetry through Ulysses (SUNY Press, 1974), Zach Bowen notes the similarity to Stephen's use of song to rebut Deasy (76)."

    "note": " One of the many ways that Ulysses defines Bloom as a fleshly being is his awareness of temperature. From the opening paragraphs of Calypso to his final minutes in Ithaca he registers wellbeing, and particularly sexual wellbeing, as \"happy warmth.\" Although he sometimes appreciates coolness on the hot day of June 16, cold figures in his imagination as a condition of lifelessness. These primal sensations of the reptilian brain color even some of Bloom's more metaphysical thoughts.",
    "expandedNote": " As the day begins, \"Gelid light and air were in the kitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere. Made him feel a bit peckish.\" The iciness of \"gelid\" night yields rhymingly to the \"gentle\" warmth of a summer day and Bloom's juices begin to flow: \"peckish\" is British idiom for hungry. As he walks the streets in happy warmth, seeking a kidney, thoughts of food and sex cluster around the sensation: \"To smell the gentle smoke of tea, fume of the pan, sizzling butter. Be near her ample bedwarmed flesh. Yes, yes.\" When he enters the bedroom, \"The warmth of her couched body rose on the air, mingling with the fragrance of the tea she poured.\" \n The association of warmth and sexual happiness continues throughout the novel. In Lestrygonians Bloom remembers the warmth of the marital bed at a time, years earlier, when he was \"Happy. Happy.\" The shops on Grafton Street send him into similar reveries: \"Sunwarm silk. . . . A warm human plumpness settled down on his brain. His brain yielded. . . . Perfumed bodies, warm, full.\" Still later in the chapter, he remembers the sexual rapture of lying with Molly on Howth Hill, and her passing a \"seedcake warm and chewed\" into his mouth: \"Joy: I ate it: joy. Young life, her lips that gave me pouting. Soft warm sticky gumjelly lips. . . . Screened under ferns she laughed warmfolded.\" \n There are similar images in Wandering Rocks (\"Warmth showered gently over him, cowing his flesh. Flesh yielded amply amid rumpled clothes\"), Sirens (\"She set free sudden in rebound her nipped elastic garter smackwarm against her smackable a woman's warmhosed thigh,\" \"Flood of warm jamjam lickitup secretness,\" \"Fill me. I'm warm, dark, open\"), Circe (\"The warm impress of her warm form. Even to sit where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to grant the last favours\"), and Ithaca: \"the anticipation of warmth (human) tempered with coolness (linen),\" \"adipose anterior and posterior female hemispheres, redolent of milk and honey and of excretory sanguine and seminal warmth\"). Even the darkness of Molly's complexion makes Bloom think of the warmth of her Mediterranean home. In Oxen of the Sun he remembers how she wore some earrings in the shape of cherries, \"bringing out the foreign warmth of the skin so daintily against the cool ardent fruit.\" \n Coldness beckons to Bloom from time to time. In Lotus Eaters, \"The cold smell of sacred stone\" calls him into the church. In Lestrygonians he seeks out the \"Cold statues\" and quiet of the museum. In Ithaca he relishes \"fresh cold neverchanging everchanging water.\" But he ultimately rejects what Circe calls the \"stonecold and pure\" demeanor of Greek goddesses, and he registers the coldness of churches as a foretaste of death. In Hades he thinks of the mortuary chapel, \"Chilly place this.\" The grave is similar. The spouse who dies must go \"alone, under the ground: and lie no more in her warm bed.\" It is better to \"Feel live warm beings near you. Let them sleep in their maggoty beds. They are not going to get me this innings. Warm beds: warm fullblooded life.\"\n In the astronomical perspective that the book adopts as a cosmographic paradigm of modern scientific thinking, life-producing heat is rare and tenuous. Bloom thinks in Lestrygonians of \"Gasballs spinning about, crossing each other, passing. Same old dingdong always. Gas: then solid: then world: then cold: then dead shell drifting around, frozen rock.\"Oxen of the Sun broods on \"the cold interstellar wind,\" and Ithaca on \"The cold of interstellar space, thousands of degrees below freezing point or the absolute zero of Fahrenheit, Centigrade or Réaumur.\" Bloom gets a taste of this life-snuffing deep freeze when Stephen refuses his invitation to stay the night, leaving his host with \"bellchime and handtouch and footstep and lonechill.\"\n The revery that Bloom calls up at the end of Lotus Eaters, a vision of tranquility, eternity, and fertility charged with echoes of spiritual fulfillment from both Christianity and Buddhism, centers on \"a womb of warmth,\" with the bath figuring as a kind of inhabiting of the fecund female body. At the contrary extreme, the dark vision of old age and death that afflicts him when the sun disappears in Calypso registers as a loss of vital corporeal heat: \"Dead: an old woman's: the grey sunken cunt of the world. / Desolation. / Grey horror seared his flesh. Folding the page into his pocket he turned into Eccles street, hurrying homeward. Cold oils slid along his veins, chilling his blood: age crusting him with a salt cloak.\""

  "050012cabstands": {
    "note": " In Lotus Eaters Bloom rounds the corner of Westland Row and Great Brunswick Street and passes by \"the drooping nags of the hazard\" on the big thoroughfare. In Hades, coming up Great Brunswick in the funeral carriage, he sees \"The hazard\" once more and thinks, \"Only two there now. Nodding. Full as a tick. Too much bone in their skulls. The other trotting round with a fare. An hour ago I was passing there.\" Hazard was the Dublin term for a cabstand or cab rank, and the horses hitched to these vehicles prompt Bloom's sympathetic reveries.",
    "expandedNote": " § Although there is no doubt about the word's denotation in this context, its origins and connotations are mysterious. The OED defines hazard as \"A cab-stand (in Ireland),\" citing no example before 1882. It seems possible that the usage arose from the threats posed by cabs constantly pulling out of street traffic and into it, attracting passengers from all directions, and disgorging passengers from both sides. The sense of peril carried by normal uses of the word appears to be picked up inHades, where Joyce contrives to associate it with Fenian violence by placing it just after \"Meade's yard.\" In a section of town where Fenians seem to be lurking everywhere, simply using the sidewalks may feel hazardous.\n Another, more etymological explanation has to do with chance. The word came into English from the Spanish azar, an unlucky throw of the dice, which itself came from Arabic words for dice games. This root meaning appears to have had some currency in Ireland, perhaps because of its geographical and historical closeness to Spain. In Ithaca, Bloom thinks of children playing \"games of hazard.\" Might this meaning have been adapted to the crapshoot chances of finding an unengaged cab? The other use cited in the OED, in the 5 December 1884 issue of the Freeman's Journal, lends some support: \"What about providing a hazard at each arrival platform? . . . the public would then know that it was beyond the power of a cab or cabman to refuse the first call.\" In hisDictionary of Hiberno-English, Terence Dolan opts for this explanation, albeit with the difference that he sees the uncertainty lying with the cabmen eager for employment: the usage, he writes, \"owes its name, doubtless, to the element of luck in the prospects of obtaining a fare.\" \n The polyglot nature of Hiberno-English may suggest still other possibilities. In a personal communication, Senan Molony wonders whether the Irish word for donkey—asal, pronounced \"azzal\" and aspirated in the plural to na hasail—might have slipped over into English at a time when many cabs were still being pulled by donkeys. Searching for the nearest English sound, might Irish speakers accustomed to carrying on their business in the dominant colonial language have taken \"hazard\" as an acceptable substitute for \"hazzal,\" the place where the donkeys meet?"

    "note": " It is a tricky business, using quotations from works you have not read to justify generalizations about life—especially when the works in question are dramatic masterpieces in which dozens of characters speak but the author does not. That does not stop Mr. Deasy from enlisting the Greatest English Writer in his cause of correcting Irish Catholic Ignorance. But if the old blowhard is wrong to find moral authority in Iago, he is right that Shakespeare was a capitalist entrepreneur.",
    "expandedNote": " First recalling an old proverb, Deasy then invokes no less a figure than the Bard to justify his love of money: \"If youth but knew. But what does Shakespeare say? Put but money in thy purse.\" Thornton cites the old proverb, \"If youth but knew what age would crave, it would both get and save.\" The italicized phrase comes from act 1 scene 3 of Othello, where Iago repeatedly urges Roderigo to sell his lands, claiming that with the money's help he can persuade Desdemona to love Roderigo. This is hardly an instance of thriftily saving up for old age, and in any case Iago is a sociopathic liar who is cheating Roderigo of his wealth. (He confides to the audience that the money will end up in his purse: \"Thus do I ever make my fool my purse.\") \n Ancient Greeks often approached the Homeric epics as if they were owners' manuals for human life, and many modern Christians oddly persist in viewing the Bible this way. In Joyce's time there was a widespread cultural conviction that life wisdom could be found in Shakespeare, and he implanted that mindset in both Deasy and Bloom. Ithaca notes that Bloom has often \"reflected on the pleasures derived from literature of instruction rather than of amusement as he himself had applied to the works of William Shakespeare more than once for the solution of difficult problems in imaginary or real life.\" \"Had he found their solution?\" the catechism asks. \"In spite of careful and repeated reading of certain classical passages, aided by a glossary, he had derived imperfect conviction from the text, the answers not bearing in all points.\"\n The narrative's mockery of Bloom here echoes Stephen's earlier contempt for Deasy, which he expresses so politely that Deasy does not notice the rebuttal: \n — Iago, Stephen murmured. \n He lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man's stare. \n — He knew what money was, Mr Deasy said. He made money. A poet, yes, but an Englishman too.\n Shakespeare did make money, and not accidentally. He was one of a handful of \"sharers\" (i.e., shareholders) in the Lord Chamberlain's (later the King's) Men, in the Theatre (later the Globe), and in the plays that the acting company produced in those theaters. The partners split obligations and profits according to their stake in the whole. Shakespeare's share was originally one eighth, 12.5%, but at the time of his retirement he held about 7%. His shares must have produced a sizeable income, because as he aged he purchased a lot of real estate in and around his home town, Stratford. He did exactly what the proverb recommends, saving up for a time when money would be important, and in much the same way as Bloom has done by purchasing Canadian railway stock paying a 4% dividend.\n Stephen's utter lack of thrift means that he could learn something from both Deasy and Bloom, but the odds that he will do so anytime soon are vanishingly small. Accepting Deasy's point about Shakespeare's love of money, he makes this \"English\" quality an object of derision rather than admiration in Scylla and Charybdis: \"He drew Shylock out of his own long pocket. The son of a maltjobber and moneylender he was himself a cornjobber and moneylender, with ten tods of corn hoarded in the famine riots. His borrowers are no doubt those divers of worship mentioned by Chettle Falstaff who reported his uprightness of dealing. He sued a fellowplayer for the price of a few bags of malt and exacted his pound of flesh in interest for every money lent.\""

And he came fifth and lost the job.” \n Earlier in the same chapter, Ned Lambert tells Simon Dedalus that he has been down in Cork recently and seen a man that Simon knew there long ago. \"And how is Dick, the solid man?\" asks Simon jovially. \"—Nothing between himself and heaven, Ned Lambert answered.\" Particularly since the men are standing in a cemetery, the reader may assume that Dick has died and gone to meet his Maker. But Simon knows the joke: \"—By the holy Paul! Mr Dedalus said in subdued wonder. Dick Tivy bald?\"\n The best joke of this sort is told by the caretaker of the cemetery, John O'Connell, who asks the members of the funeral party if they have heard the one about the two drunks looking for the grave of a friend named Mulcahy: they find it and one reads out his name while the other is looking up at a statue of the Savior erected over the grave. “Not a bloody bit like the man, says he. That's not Mulcahy, says he, whoever done it.”"

    "note": " Is Leopold Bloom Jewish? Ulysses makes this question surprisingly difficult to answer, toying with the reader by throwing out seemingly contradictory evidence. The effect is to raise questions about the essential nature of Jewishness, and about human cultural identities in general.",
    "expandedNote": " Jewish identity can be defined in many different ways, crossing boundaries of race, religion, nationality, family, and culture. The most emotionally compelling of those categories is the first. Seen by some as a constitutive biological condition imparting important physical and psychological characteristics to individuals, race is dismissed by others as an invidious abstraction. Certainly the ability of all human beings to procreate with others of their species, and the rapidly dilutive effects of intermarriage, suggest that races (i.e., distinct subspecies of Homo sapiens) are at most temporary states in an evolutionary continuum, maintained only by physical isolation or by ideals and taboos promoting cultural exclusivity. But some racial differences can hardly be denied.\n Joyce's thoughts reflect these ambiguities. Although he was well aware of the many successive waves of invasion and intermarriage that had produced his own people, and thus skeptical of all claims of ethnic purity, he did not hesitate to use the word \"race\" to name the Irish—as for example at the end of A Portrait of the Artist, when Stephen famously declares his intention to \"forge in the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race.\" In Aeolus Professor MacHugh uses the same terminology to demean the English: \"I speak the tongue of a race the acme of whose mentality is the maxim: time is money.\" And Ithaca describes the Jews as \"a selected or rejected race,\" pairing their divine nomination and their diasporic suffering. Joyce uses such language loosely—Ulysses frequently refers to the entire human \"race\"—but he seems to have placed some credence in racial characteristics. Turn-of-the-century theories about Jewish capacities and proclivities do show up in the novel.\n Bloom himself does not hesitate to invoke race in identifying himself as Jewish. In Cyclops he compares the Irish and the Jews: \"And I belong to a race too . . . that is hated and persecuted.\" But his family tree offers contradictory evidence for whether or not he in fact belongs to that race, and raises questions (familiar to Americans from discourses about blacks and Indians) about how great a blood quantum may be necessary to warrant a label. On his father's side he is descended from three generations (and probably many more) of central European Jews, but the hypothesis offered in Ithaca for Milly's blond hair raises questions of intermarriage all the way down the line: \"blond, born of two dark, she had blond ancestry, remote, a violation, Herr Hauptmann Hainau, Austrian army.\" And, more importantly, Bloom is at most half Jewish, because his mother, Ellen Higgins, was a Roman Catholic Irishwoman.\n Indeed, by one traditional definition he is not Jewish at all. That definition is matriarchal: the son or daughter of a Jewish woman is a Jew. This is doubtless what Bloom has in mind when Ithaca asks, \"What, reduced to their simplest reciprocal form, were Bloom's thoughts about Stephen's thoughts about Bloom and about Stephen's thoughts about Bloom's thoughts about Stephen?\" Answer: \"He thought that he thought that he was a jew whereas he knew that he knew that he knew that he was not.\" Bloom's thoughts about Stephen's thoughts about Bloom? He assumes that Stephen thinks of him as a Jew. Bloom's thoughts about Stephen's thoughts about Bloom's thoughts about Stephen? He knows that Stephen knows that Bloom knows that Stephen knows that he is not a Jew. How does Bloom know this? Because he told Stephen so in Eumaeus, recounting how the Citizen \"called me a jew, and in a heated fashion, offensively. So I, without deviating from plain facts in the least, told him his God, I mean Christ, was a jew too, and all his family, like me, though in reality I'm not.\" \n Bloom is \"in reality\" not a Jew because Ellen was a Gentile. But the contradictory way in which he asserts this categorization (Christ was a jew, like me) indicates that he nevertheless thinks of himself as Jewish. Why should he do so? One obvious answer is that the Gentile culture of Dublin, which carries strong strains of anti-Semitism, tells him every day that he is a Jew. Nor does this acculturation depend solely on overt and hostile messages like those of the Citizen. For every aggressive bigot there are more than a few Dubliners who quietly accept Bloom into their society, allowing him to pass as one of them, while indicating in subtle but unmistakable ways that he is racially Other. Reuben J. Dodd comes in for verbal abuse in Hades while Bloom does not, but everyone in the carriage, Bloom included, knows what links the two men. Lenehan's ellipsis in Wandering Rocks, refusing to attach the ugly name of Jew to Bloom, says it all: \"He's not one of your common or garden... you know...\" \n But Bloom has also been acculturated to think of himself as Jewish in a more loving way, by the father whom he thinks about far more often than he thinks of his mother. Rudolph himself sought to pass in Irish society, legally changing his name from Virag to Bloom and converting to Catholicism when he married Ellen. He had his son Leopold baptized in the Christian faith, and Nausicaa reveals that he did not have him circumcised: \"This wet is very unpleasant. Stuck. Well the foreskin is not back. Better detach.\" But at home Rudolph instructed his son in Jewish religious traditions, taught him some Hebrew, and clearly raised him to think of himself as a Jew. When Bloom reached young manhood he rebelled against his father's religious teachings, dismissing them as irrational and backward. But in middle age he regrets the uncompromising zeal of that rebellion, and is eager to teach Stephen some of the wealth of his cultural inheritance. \n Calypso wastes no time in demonstrating Bloom's lack of interest in orthodox observance. Deciding against a mutton kidney, he thinks, \"Better a pork kidney at Dlugacz's.\" His thoughts about his cat later in the chapter confirm that he is perfectly well aware of his transgression: \"Give her too much meat she won't mouse. Say they won't eat pork. Kosher.\" But the secularist implications of eating non-kosher food, bought from a Jewish butcher no less, are somewhat muted when Bloom leaves the house several paragraphs later and assures himself \"On the doorstep\" that he has his potato with him—practicing an improvised version of the talismanic touching of a mezuzah that he learned from his grandfather. He rejects the Citizen's simpleminded conflation of ethnic and national identity (he sees no contradiction between being Jewish and being Irish), but he energetically defends international Jewry and shows some interest in the Zionist program of building a Jewish proto-state in Palestine. \n Perhaps the lesson to draw from such antitheses is that all of us are mongrels, defined by a host of biological and cultural conditions that do not cohere in an essential Jewishness, Irishness, or any other Whatness. Dublin's provincial and xenophobic culture clings to such anti-cosmopolitan essentialism. By making his protagonist ambiguously \"Jewish\" Joyce did not simply offer resistance to the ideology of anti-Semitism that was gaining strength in the early 20th century. He created someone who is simultaneously inside Dublin and outside it. Bloom's exotic provenance and his experiences of prejudice help him to see through the myths of belonging that are a poor substitute for true individuality."

    "expandedNote": " Stephen's talk constitutes nearly the whole of Scylla and Charybdis.

He has an opportunity to be present in the National Library when Stephen speaks, but chooses to go instead to a bookshop to buy a copy of Douglas Hyde's Lovesongs of Connaught. In the following chapter, Wandering Rocks, Mulligan says to him, \"O, but you missed Dedalus on Hamlet.\" Opening \"his newbought book,\" Haines apologizes perfunctorily, observing that \"Shakespeare is the happy huntingground of minds that have lost their balance.\""

  "010022hellenise": {
    "note": " When Mulligan says in Telemachus that he and Stephen working together \"might do something for the island. Hellenise it,\" he is voicing a tenet of late Victorian counterculture advanced by the English poet and man of letters \"Matthew Arnold\" (1822-1888). Arnold's theory informs statements elsewhere in Ulysses about Greekness and Jewishness.",
    "expandedNote": " In the essays collected as Culture and Anarchy (1869), Arnold attacked the smug, backward \"provinciality\" of English culture, which was dominated by well-mannered aristocratic \"Barbarians\" and even more by morally earnest middle-class \"Philistines.\" In the fourth essay he distinguished the Philistines' impulse of Hebraism (letting the revealed truth of religion guide one's actions) from the intellectual and aesthetic impulse of Hellenism (seeking truth disinterestedly, using human rather than divine guides). Arnold felt that English culture was excessively Hebraic and needed rebalancing. He was agnostic himself, but he admired religious contemporaries like John Henry Newman.\n By the end of the century, however, Arnold’s language had been subsumed into a black-and-white cultural war between repressive middle-class \"philistines\" and freedom-loving, artistic \"bohemians\" (a term that had emerged in Paris in the early 19th century to describe artists). “Greek,” Gifford observes, now connoted bohemian freedom, sensual pleasure, and aesthetic beauty, while “Jew” connoted social repression, “straightlaced Victorian morality,” and hostility to art. \n Mulligan embodies the decadence of this fin-de-sièclescene, and he shows none of Arnold’s interest in restoring cultural balance. His Hellenism consists of Swinburnean values: flashy style over intellectual substance, hedonism over conventional morality, and atheistic blasphemy over religious piety. In Scylla and Charybdis he praises \"The Greek mouth that has never been twisted in prayer.\"\n Ulysses also drops a hint or two that Mulligan may entertain the ancient Greek openness to choice of genders in sexual pursuits. In the same part of Scylla and Charybdis, having seen Bloom looking between the nether cheeks of the statue of a Greek goddess, he not only infers that the Jew is interested in a forbidden kind of intercourse: “O, I fear me, he is Greeker than the Greeks. His pale Galilean eyes were upon her mesial groove.” He also infers that such interest implies sexual ambidexterity: “The wandering jew . . . Did you see his eye? He looked upon you to lust after you. I fear thee, ancient mariner. O, Kinch, thou art in peril. Get thee a breechpad.” A certain amount of projection seems to be going on. Mulligan sounds distinctly queeny in recounting what Dowden said about Shakespeare: “Lovely! Buck Mulligan suspired amorously. I asked him what he thought of the charge of pederasty brought against the bard. He lifted his hands and said: All we can say is that life ran very high in those days. Lovely!” To which someone in the following line (almost certainly Stephen) thinks, “Catamite.” \n Mulligan’s joking about Bloom being simultaneously a Jew and Greek points comically and obliquely (a way in which this book typically makes meaning) toward the Arnoldian idea that (contra Mulligan’s own practice) these two cultural impulses might coexist, combine, and even coincide. In Circe a cap exclaims, “Jewgreek is greekjew. Extremes meet. Death is the highest form of life. Bah!” \n This coincidence of contraries is manifested most obviously in the coming together of the book’s two principal characters. The first chapter identifies Stephen with Hellenism in ways ranging from his \"Paris fads\" and his “ancient Greek\" names to his principled refusal to compromise his intellect for the sake of his mother’s piety. Bloom dresses and acts like a conventional middle-class wage-earner, he becomes identified with the ancient, archetypal figure of the wandering Jew, and his relentlessly practical and moral sensibility contrasts starkly with Stephen’s high intellectual and aesthetic disregard for such things (even though he has, like Stephen, rejected religion). To the extent that some uncanny Father-Son unity is realized between these very different men, jewgreek is indeed greekjew.\n Despite Arnold's importance in theorizing the union of Hellenic intellectual freedom with Hebraic moral rectitude, Ulysses subjects him to some mockery as a stuffy English gentleman of the previous generation, using the same imagery with which it trivializes \"Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet.\" When Stephen imagines a scene at Magdalen College, Oxford in Telemachus, he places Arnold there, tending to the prim propriety of the place: \"A deaf gardener, aproned, masked with Matthew Arnold's face, pushes his mower on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms.\" In Circe \"The Siamese twins, Philip Drunk and Philip Sober, two Oxford dons with lawnmowers, appear in the window embrasure. Both are masked with Matthew Arnold's face.\"\n Of these passages Gifford observes that \"Arnold's emphasis on restraint, poise, and taste, and on what contemporaries called the 'ethical element' in literature, was regarded as Philistinism incarnate by turn-of-the-century aesthetes, even though many of their terms were derived from Arnold and Arnold's influence was (from an academic point of view) still paramount in English criticism.\""

    "note": " Deasy's letter mentions a \"Mr Henry Blackwood Price\" in connection with foot-and-mouth disease. Soon after Stephen reads this detail in the letter, Deasy explains its significance to him: \"My cousin, Blackwood Price, writes to me it is regularly treated and cured in Austria by cattledoctors there. They offer to come over here.\" Joyce got Deasy's interest in the health of cattle not from Francis Irwin, but from an Irishman whom he met in Italy, and apparently liked—a man named Henry Blackwood Price. Moreover, when Deasy, acting on behalf of his cousin HBP, writes a letter about the disease to Irish newspapers he is playing a role that Joyce, acting on behalf of his friend HBP, himself performed. The novel also includes an M.P. named \"William Field\" whom the real Blackwood Price, with Joyce's help, contacted for assistance in the matter.",
    "expandedNote": " In 1912, when he was in Trieste, Joyce met Henry Nicholas Blackwood Price. Blackwood Price was proud of his Ulster ancestry (hence Deasy's boast about being \"descended from Sir John Blackwood who voted for the union\"), and he was concerned about the spread of foot-and-mouth disease, which at that time was wasting cattle herds in the Austro-Hungarian empire. He asked Joyce to find the address of an Irish M.P., William Field, who feared that the disease might spread to Ireland, because he wanted to tell Field of a cure that Austrian scientists had developed. Joyce got the address, Blackwood Price sent a letter to Field, and Field saw that the letter was published in the Evening Telegraph on 19 August 1912 (CW 238). \n In Ulysses the action develops slightly differently. Blackwood Price is now the cousin of Mr. Deasy, and interests him in the problem. Deasy asks Stephen for help getting his letter in the papers, and turns to William Field for another kind of assistance. \"I wrote last night to Mr Field, M.P. There is a meeting of the cattletraders' association today at the City Arms hotel. I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting.\" In Cyclops Joe Hynes mentions that he has just seen a local politician, Joseph Patrick Nannetti, in the company of Field: \"I saw him up at that meeting now with William Field, M. P., the cattle traders.\" Apparently some position on foot-and-mouth was decided at the meeting, because Hynes adds that \"Field and Nannetti are going over tonight to London to ask about it on the floor of the house of commons.\" Despite his weak grasp of the science involved, then, Deasy's proposal appears to be making some progress toward political enactment.\n Joyce's assistance to Blackwood Price did not end with finding an address for Mr. Field. A letter from his brother Charles to his brother Stanislaus dated 6 September 1912 indicates that Joyce wrote his own editorial letter for the Freeman's Journal, which appeared unsigned in the paper on 10 September 1912. That short article, included in Joyce's Critical Writings under the title \"Politics and Cattle Disease,\" argues for active and transparent monitoring of Irish herds to fight against a destructive English embargo on Irish cattle.\n It is interesting, to say the least, that Joyce modeled the pompous and prejudiced old man who makes life difficult for his proud young persona partly on a man whom he liked, and partly on himself. At the end of Nestor, as Stephen trudges off with Deasy's letter in his pocket (he will place the letter in the Evening Telegraph, the same newspaper that published Blackwood Price's letter, and sister publication of the Freeman's Journal in which Joyce published his), he thinks, \"Still I will help him in his fight. Mulligan will dub me a new name: the bullockbefriending bard.\" The same could be said of Joyce. It might also be supposed that, by including a tiny sliver of himself in Deasy, he sympathized with the old man's wish to give paternal advice to the wayward young poet."

  "050026henryflower": {
    "note": " Bloom's surname is an English-language approximation of the Hungarian \"Virag\" that his father changed after he moved to Ireland. To conduct clandestine erotic correspondence, Bloom has devised yet another such name, \"Henry Flower.\" Countless details in the novel suggest that he cherishes his name's association with flowers, most often in the context of romantic longing—fittingly, since flowers are a plant's sexual organs.",
    "expandedNote": " Virág, which means flower, is a common Hungarian surname used also as a female given name. It first comes up inCyclops, when the list of foreign dignitaries attending the execution includes a Hungarian aristocrat with a flowery middle name: \"Countess Marha Virága Kisászony Putrápesthi.\" Later in the same chapter, when Jack Power asks whether Bloom is related to \"Bloom the dentist,\" Martin Cunningham replies, \"Not at all. . . . His name was Virag, the father’s name that poisoned himself. He changed it by deedpoll, the father did.\" Ithaca reveals that Bloom's desk drawer contains a newspaper cutting announcing this legal change: \"I, Rudolph Virag, now resident at no 52 Clanbrassil street, Dublin, formerly of Szombathely in the kingdom of Hungary, hereby give notice that I have assumed and intend henceforth upon all occasions and at all times to be known by the name of Rudolph Bloom.\"\n The cosmopolitan Rudolph must have known people with names derived from the German and Yiddish words for flower—the Austro-Hungarian empire had many Blumes, Blums, Rosenblums, and Weissblums—and he would have found these names much easier to Anglicize than Virag. When he named his son Leopold, he performed a corresponding transliteration of the given name of his father Lipóti. The Hungarian does not evoke any close English-language equivalents, so Rudolph resorted again to German. The ancient Germanic name Luitbald (meaning \"brave people\"), modernized over the centuries as Leopold, had become quite common in Austria.\n Bloom has perpetuated the family tradition of naming sons after grandfathers, making a four-generation chain: Lipoti (the proto-Leopold), then Rudolph, then Leopold (Poldy), then Rudolph (Rudy). His grandfather \"Lipoti Virag, basilicogrammate\" (Gifford and Slote translate the Greek title as \"royal secretary,\" Slote noting that it \"is attested in papyri\") appears in Circe and holds forth at great length, justifying his name by being an expert on human sexuality and author of \"Sexology or the Love Passion which Doctor L. B. says is the book sensation of the year.\" His introduces himself: \"My name is Virag Lipoti, of Szombathely. [Hungarians use the Eastern name order.] (He coughs thoughtfully, drily.) Promiscuous nakedness is much in evidence hereabouts, eh?\" For a short time in this chapter, Virag shares the stage with a fifth male Bloom, the fictive Henry Flower. \n \"Henry Flower, Esq,\" the name that Bloom reads on Martha's \"typed envelope\" in Lotus Eaters, no doubt appears also on the printed calling card that he has just handed to the postmistress behind the window. In choosing this pseudonym, he has indulged an affection for the resonances of his family name, and perhaps also a wish to integrate himself more deeply into Anglophone Christian society. \"Bloom\" still carries echoes of German and Jewish surnames. \"Flower,\" by contrast, goes far back in the family records of medieval England, and some Irish people too have borne the name. \n Similarly, although the name Henry came originally from Germany it was naturalized in medieval England and Ireland and sounds far less exotic than Leopold. Heinrich means \"home ruler\"—a signification consonant with the \"brave people\" meaning of Luitbald. If there is one thing that Bloom is not, however, it is the ruler of his home. The first part of his pseudonym carries an ironic weight that is pointed up by his erotic correspondent: \"Are you not happy in your home you poor little naughty boy?\"\n Some readers, including Vivien Igoe, see \"Henry Flower\" as having been inspired by a real person of that name who worked for the Dublin Metropolitan Police from 1887 to 1900. Constable Flower was a burly working-class man from the countryside who would seem to fit Bloom's stereotype of policemen in Lestrygonians: \"Foodheated faces, sweating helmets, patting their truncheons. After their feed with a good load of fat soup under their belts. . . . Let out to graze. Best moment to attack one in pudding time. A punch in his dinner.\" Bloom could hardly identify with such men or aspire to become like them in the fantasy realm of his erotic correspondence. His abhorrence of gluttony, his physical tenderness, his pacifism, his subversive politics, his memory (likewise recorded in Lestrygonians)of almost being viciously beaten by constables while attending a political protest—all these things make it unlikely that he is modeling himself on a policeman. \n However, Bloom's creator may well have intended to identify him with Constable Flower. If so, it must have been because this policeman was accused of a sexual crime. Igoe summarizes the story of how a young domestic servant named Brigid Gannon was found drowned in the River Dodder and strong suspicion fell on Henry Flower. A grand jury declined to indict him, but he resigned from the force in disgrace and left Dublin in 1900. (Long after the publication ofUlysses, a dying old woman confessed that she had taken Gannon's money, pushed her into the river, and framed Flower.) There may be a connection to the Bloom who is accused of unspeakable things in Circe. Joyce did not place Henry Flower, who does appear in that chapter, in any of these accusatory scenes, but he did include one detail that links Bloom's amatory persona with sexual criminality. In the moment when Henry Flower and Lipoti Virag appear together, Henry the lover briefly becomes Henry the murderer: \"HENRY: (Caressing on his breast a severed female head, murmurs.) Thine heart, mine love. (He plucks his lutestrings.) When first I saw...\"\n Bloom's thoughts about his persona evoke something closer to Flower Power poet Henry Gibson and the Make Love Not War generation of late 1960s America. The lute, harp, dulcimer, and guitar that Henry Flower variously carries in Circe make him a comical troubadour: \"(In a low dulcet voice, touching the strings of his guitar.) There is a flower that bloometh.\" The flower blooms with erotic longing. When Bloom was courting Molly, the romantic gestures that impressed her included the birthday \"when he sent me the 8 big poppies because mine was the 8th,\" and the picnic on Howth Head when he called her \"my mountain flower.\" In Nausicaa he thinks that women \"Open like flowers, know their hours, sunflowers, Jerusalem artichokes, in ballrooms, chandeliers, avenues under the lamps.\" At the end of Lotus Eaters he sees his own sexual organ as \"a languid floating flower.\" Molly is entirely in sync with this way of thinking: \"yes he said I was a flower of the mountain yes so we are flowers all a womans body yes that was one true thing he said in his life and the sun shines for you today yes that was why I liked him because I saw he understood or felt what a woman is.\"\n Martha Clifford loves the sensitivity implied by Henry's \"beautiful name,\" and she attempts to communicate with him in the language of flowers, a tongue that Bloom seems to speak at least a little. When he replies to her letter in Sirens he continues the play, as shown in the list of themes at the beginning of the chapter: \"I feel so sad. P. S. So lonely blooming.\" Henry's flowery sadness is informed by the grief Bloom feels at Boylan's departure for Eccles Street. The posy on his table in the Ormond dining room tells him that the flower of his wife's body is opening to another man: \"Light sob of breath Bloom sighed on the silent bluehued flowers.\""

The image of \"a naked woman shining in her courts\" appears to echo a passage about prostitutes in John Dryden'sMac Flecknoe (1682), which parodies a couplet by Abraham Cowley.",
    "expandedNote": " Gifford notes the original fancy of the sea as a place of female \"courts\" in Cowley's biblical epic Davideis (1656): \"Where their vast Courts the Mother-Waters keep, / And undisturb'd by Moon in Silence sleep.\" In the mock-heroic spirit for which he is known, Dryden transposed the image from the solemn splendor of the vast ocean to the countless brothels in London's Barbican district: \"Scenes of lewd loves, and of polluted joys / Where their vast courts the mother-strumpets keep, / And, undisturbed by watch, in silence sleep\" (71-73) Mac Flecknoe crowns its anti-hero Shadwell the king of dullness in the Barbican area, which serves as a kind of microcosm for the dirt and decadence of the English capital. The \"watch\" which does not disturb the strumpets' sleep is probably the constabulary. \n Stephen's image of \"courts\" contains none of the Barbican's seediness, but the fact that he places a \"naked woman\" in them—and the fact that she is \"shining\"— suggest that he has been reading Dryden rather than Cowley. His thoughts about naked women here, far from indulging the Catholic hatred of sexuality that he expresses elsewhere, incline toward sympathy."

  "070007hibernianmetropolis": {
    "note": " After six relatively placid chapters (Nestor has shouting schoolboys, Hades some clattering horsedrawn carriages), Aeolus plunges the reader into the \"THE HEART OF THE HIBERNIAN METROPOLIS\": lower Sackville Street and adjoining thoroughfares, where dozens of \"clanging\" trams are noisily converging and departing, clanking presses are churning out miles of newsprint, mail cars are lining up before the General Post Office to receive flung sacks of mail, barrels of porter are \"dullthudding\" out of a warehouse and rolling onto a barge, a conductor is shouting out directions, and bootblacks are drumming up business. In this cacophonous bustle, two impressions compete: Ireland does have a city to rival other great European capitals; but far from being purely \"Hibernian,\" this is a conspicuously imperial capital.",
    "expandedNote": " Joyce begins his cameo portrait of the metropolis with the urban tram system that in 1904 was a source of great civic pride. Over the preceding three decades tramlines had been laid throughout greater Dublin, and by 1901 all the lines were electrified and sported a fleet of mostly double-decker electric trams. Bloom's repeated musings about the benefits of running \"a tramline from the parkgate to the quays\" with cattle \"trucks\" to avoid having to drive the animals through the streets, and running a \"line out to the cemetery gates\" with \"municipal funeral trams like they have in Milan\" (Hades) reflects the spirit of civic improvement with which Dubliners greeted an urban transportation system that in 1904 was perhaps the best in Europe. \n In Dublin in Bloomtime, Cyril Pearl quotes Tom Kettle, \"the brilliant young writer who was killed in World War I,\" to the effect that \"The tramcar is the social confessional of Dublin. Sixpence prudently spent on fares will provide you with a liberal education\" (17-18). That sense of expansive cosmopolitan communication appears in Joyce's next vignette, the activity surrounding \"the general post office.\" The letters, cards, and parcels in the flung sacks are bound \"for local, provincial, British and overseas delivery,\" and delivery to Britain, at least, was quite swift. Twice a day mailboats promptly left the enclosed harbor at Kingstown bound for Holyhead in Wales, after receiving mail delivered by express trains from Dublin. Other trains quickly shuttled the mail from Holyhead to London. \n But as the title of that second section, \"THE WEARER OF THE CROWN,\" proclaims, the \"mailcars\" were the property of \"His Majesty,\" \"E.R.,\"Rex Edward VII, and every part of the efficient system from \"North Prince's street\" to Kingstown harbor existed to facilitate communication between the two imperial capitals of Dublin and London. \"Nelson's pillar,\" an immense granite Doric column topped with a heroic statue of Britain's most brilliantly successfulnaval leader, was erected in Dublin in 1808, 35 years before the British got around to building a similar one in Trafalgar Square in London. Dublin has always been an imperial city (it was founded by Vikings), and in the paragraphs that begin Aeolus one can hear Joyce's recognition of the tension between aspiring to be one of the great cities of Europe and knowing that it is one of the key cities in the British empire."

Thoughts, dialogue, and narrative are studded with fragments, abbreviations, acronyms, and single letters plucked from the beginnings and ends of words. Joyce's aim may be, in part, simply to mimic the ways in which human beings use language, but he also deploys these devices to comic effect and explores their linguistic, epistemological, and hermeneutic implications. The pattern of shortening words is established when Bloom picks up his \"Plasto's high grade ha.\"",
    "expandedNote": " These four words appear in a \"sweated legend in the crown\" of the hat, suggesting that the final letter may have been worn away by repeated use, or obscured by \"hairoil,\" or sewn out of sight in a seam. Things like that happen to printed letters all the time, and a lesser novel would supply the missing one on the premise that that's what such a fragment isreally saying. Joyce had a finer and quirkier sense of reality. He presents the mutilated morphology as is and goes out of his way to suggest that it has been perpetuated in Bloom's consciousness, becoming a new word that he recalls whenever he looks in his hat. When the object is featured again at the beginning of Lotus Eaters, the narrative's free indirect style shows how he thinks of it: \"Under their dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow of the leather headband inside his high grade ha.\"\n Many interpretive responses to this shortened word are possible. One writer of a weblog (www.spectacle.org) infers that the entire novel is a high grade (allusive, intellectual, pretentious) ha (a big joke, sending up the overly serious reader). Alternatively, one might note that, in the moment before Bloom's eyes spot the hat's \"legend\" in Lotus Eaters, he has been reading other \"legends\" on packets of tea in a shop window: \"In Westland row he halted before the window of the Belfast and Oriental Tea Company and read the legends of leadpapered packets: choice blend, finest quality, family tea. Rather warm. Tea. Must get some from Tom Kernan.\" Has one company's legend poached a letter from another's, conscripting it to serve in making a new kind of meaning? In Lestrygonians, Bloom is still repeating the T in memory and dwelling on its sound: \"Tea.Tea. Tea. I forgot to tapTom Kernan.\" \n Whatever one may make of this verbal odd duck, it certainly is not flying solo. Lestrygonians features many such single letters. Some are familiar and unremarkable: Jack Power's father, Bloom thinks, was \"a G man\"—a plainclothes officer in Dublin Castle employed by the G division of the D. M. P. , which surveilledFenian activity. But the novel has itself produced Y and S men a few pages earlier, when a sandwichboard display passes by Bloom on Westmoreland Street: \"A procession of whitesmocked men marched slowly towards him along the gutter, scarlet sashes across their boards. . . . He read the scarlet letters on their five tall white hats: H. E. L. Y. S. Wisdom Hely's. Y lagging behind drew a chunk of bread from under his foreboard, crammed it into his mouth and munched as he walked.\" Bloom crosses the street when \"apostrophe S had plodded by.\" Just as T becomes estranged from signifying Plasto's hats and advertises a different product, so Hely's personified letters stray away from their word, become separate entities, and threaten to signify something on their own. \n Perhaps Y and S mean nothing at all, but the whole string of men with letters on their chests makes Bloom think of acronyms, in which each individual letter initiates a word: \"Like that priest they are this morning: we have sinned: we have suffered.\" The priest in Lotus Eaters had IHS emblazoned on his surplice, prompting Bloom to grasp at the significance: \"I have sinned: or no: I have suffered, it is.\" He returns now to this mistaken interpretation, just as earlier in Lestrygonians he returned to a second acronym he thought of in the church, INRI: \"Iron nails ran in.\" Such abbreviations usually have clear meaning to an in-crowd: every Latin-trained priest knows that INRI signifiesIesus Nazarenus, Rex Iudaeorum, Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews. But even churchmen differ on the significance of IHS: do the letters mean In Hoc Signo or Iesus Hominum Salvator? In fact the foreign-language estrangement goes one level deeper: both constructions falsify an original Greek signification. \n Isolated letters, whether traveling alone or strung together in acronyms and similar abbreviations, invite readers to complete the communicative circuit by supplying other letters necessary to make some word or words. They invite inference, but at the same time they conceal the thing signified from those who do not already know the words. Anyone not in the know may wallow in ignorance for years, which is what has happened to readers of Ulysses from two more letters in Lestrygonians. Someone has scrawled \"U.P.: Up\" on a postcard and sent it to Dennis Breen, who goes half mad with paranoid inference. Breen feels certain that he knows what the letters mean, and perhaps the jokester who mailed the card does too. Intrepid annotators can join them by identifying some highly plausible referents, but it is always possible that Jim is having a high grade ha at their expense, and that the prankster is doing the same with Breen.\n The novel contains some less interesting abbreviations drawn from common speech which nevertheless twist readers' minds in similar knots as they try to supply the missing letters. In CalypsoBloom thinks of \"M'Auley's down there: n. g. as position,\" almost certainly shorthand for \"no good.\" (The \"first principle of real estate\" is location, location, location!) In Lestrygonians he imagines that ads for gonorrhea treatments have been posted in greenhouses \"on the q. t.,\" which Slote, citing Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, says means \"quiet.\" (By subtracting the three letters between the initial letter and the last one, perhaps?) In Eumaeus Bloom thinks that hiring a cab to ride home with Stephen might be a good idea \"in their then condition, both of them being e.d.ed.\" Gifford and Slote both gloss the abbreviation as slang for \"exhausted,\" but the provenance is unclear, and the chapter's narrator makes matters worse by tacking a second \"ed\" onto the first one to form a spectacularly inept past participle. \n Other not-quite-acronymic abbreviations sprout up in institutions like the aristocracy and the clergy that heap multiple titles on their distinguished members, finding it helpful to coin shorthand versions that can be hung on a name like medals on a chest. Joyce clearly enjoyed the absurdity of this. At the beginning of Wandering Rocks \"Father Conmee S.J.\" (Society of Jesus) chats with the wife of \"Mr David Sheehy M.P.\" (Member of Parliament), walks on, sees a sign announcing that \"The reverend T. R. Greene B.A.\" (Bachelor of Arts) \"will (D.V.)\" (Deo volente, God willing) \"speak,\" steps onto a tram from which \"Nicholas Dudley C. C.\" (Curate in Charge) has just stepped off, and ponders the mission of \"saint Peter Claver S.J.\" to the many Africans \"to whom the faith had not (D.V.) been brought.\" Cyclops supplies a long list of clergymen adorned with 17 such tags. They name real titles and orders, but the prevalence of a handful of favored capitals (especially C, O, P, S, and D) gives the impression that the letters are somehow copulating and multiplying. \n Cyclops also heaps a smothering truckload of 19 honorific abbreviations on \"H. R. H.\" (His Royal Highness) George, Prince of Wales: \"K. G., K. P., K. T., P. C., K. C. B., M. P, J. P., M. B., D. S. O., S. O. D., M. F. H., M. R. I. A., B. L., Mus. Doc., P. L. G., F. T. C. D., F. R. U. I., F. R. C. P. I. and F. R. C. S. I.\" Some of the titles are genuine, some are real but weirdly inapplicable, and some are simply mocking. The game of discerning just what kind of honor might be signified by such abbreviations spins off, in other parts of Ulysses, into sheer inventive play, as when Aeolus headlines turn the crude taunts \"kiss my arse\" and \"kiss my royal Irish arse\" into the respectable-sounding \"K. M. A.\" and \"K. M. R. I. A.\" In Scylla and Charybdis a meaningless mnemonic turns out to carry a message when Stephen ponders his debt to George Russell: \"A. E. I. O. U.\" \n Distinct from these many initial-letter abbreviations are the times when a single letter is subtracted from a word, as in the case of Bloom's ha. Other such words occur to him quite naturally as reflections of idiomatic speech. In Lotus Eaters he thinks of a poor street urchin \"Waiting outside pubs to bring da home. Come home to ma, da.\" In Aeolus he uses a staple of hurried newsroom discourse when he asks Nannetti to insert a short paragraph about Alexander Keyes' business into the paper: \"Well, you can do that and just a little par calling attention. You know the usual. Highclass licensed premises. Longfelt want. So on.\" Later in the chapter another newspaperman uses the same shorthand: \"— Of course, if he wants a par, Red Murray said earnestly, a pen behind his ear, we can do him one.\"\n Readers may infer that every such fragment is mere slang, as insignificant as ma or da. If they do, they will miss the rich suggestiveness of \"ba\" in Nausicaa. A sleepy Bloom notices a bat flitting about in the evening sky: \"Ba. What is that flying about? Swallow? Bat probably.\" Is Bloom somehow tiredly laboring to articulate the word \"bat\"? Not likely, because he first wonders if the flying animal is a bird, and then decides it is a bat, with no difficulty of recall. Is he merely expelling air from his lips to express his frustration at not knowing what the animal is, in a low-energy form of \"Bah!\"? Possibly, but why then does he repeat the tiny sentence (\"Ba.\") three more times over the course of the next paragraph and a half? \n A glimpse of what Joyce may be doing here comes into somewhat clearer focus if one realizes that Bâ is an English transliteration of the Egyptian hieroglyphic for a part of the human soul that survives death and flies away like a bird. In many of the sentences after Bloom's four uses of the word, he thinks about \"Metempsychosis\" and metamorphosis and fancies that the bat is \"Like a little man in a cloak.\" But it seems unlikely that Bloom would know much about ancient Egyptian metaphysics, so perhaps Joyce is layering his own learned symbolism on his protagonist's relatively unsophisticated thoughts—as happens often in the novel. Still, the reader is challenged to construe Bloom's thought process each time he articulates the syllable. One thing is clear: the fragment does not signify \"bat\" in any simple, one-to-one way, but it does link the flying mammal with the flying soul-principle.\n At other times, the novel shows Bloom hearing or seeing part of a word and struggling to identify the complete unit. Hades registers his hearing \"Oot: a dullgarbed old man from the curbstone tendered his wares, his mouth opening: oot\" just before revealing what the old man is selling: \"Four bootlaces for a penny.\" In Lestrygonians, he spots four letters on a YMCA pamphlet and for a second wildly supposes that his own name may be on it: \"Bloo... Me? No.\" The word is \"blood.\" This brief adventure of sense-making, enlivened by a witty elaboration of M into \"Me,\" illustrates the pervasive human habit of seizing on some bit of information plucked from the welter of sensory experience and guessing at the larger pattern it may represent. Daniel Kahneman's 2011 book Thinking, Fast and Slow argues that the human brain is constantly leaping to conclusions by such heuristic shortcuts. \n Having seen himself on a piece of paper by adding a letter that is not there, Bloom later finds himself removed from a piece of paper by the subtraction of a letter that should be there. In Eumaeus he is \"Nettled not a little\" to see that the Evening Telegraph has listed an \"L. Boom\" among the mourners at Dignam's funeral. At the graveside, the reporter Joe Hynes, who knows Bloom well enough to borrow money from him but not well enough to remember his \"christian name,\" has gotten him to say that it is \"L . . . Leopold.\" This initial letter finds its way into the paper but then disappears from the surname—almost as if a typesetter robbed the L from an adjoining word to complete the line. (The same article contains a line of badly \"bitched type,\" which Bloom attributes to a typesetter's distraction.) \n As with the migratory T, the sliding L raises interpretive questions for readers: should it be regarded merely as an instance of the proofreading problems to which daily newspapers are susceptible, or does it evoke something distinctive about Bloom? Critics have noted more than once its affinity for the \"contransmagnificandjewbangtantiality\" in Proteus, where Jesus the Jew makes a big boom. For Bloom himself, the change becomes just another amusing quirk to incorporate into his self-image: \"L. Boom pointed it out to his companion B. A.\" (Stephen Dedalus, Bachelor of Arts).\n In addition to any other kinds of sense that one may make of Joyce's verbal truncations, it seems fair to say that his novel captures the bewilderment and epistemological pluck of human beings plunged into the maelstrom of linguistic mutability. Botched type, obscured print, fragmentary sight, imperfect hearing, advertising gimmicks, highbrow titles, insider patois, idiomatic slang, foreign words, beguiling coincidences: all these things throw chaff at the mind's radar, muddying the waters of communication and making language something more than a logically arranged sequence of clearly articulated concepts."

  "050020highschool": {
    "note": " The \"high school,\" \"High school,\" or \"High School\" that Bloom attended as a teenager was the Erasmus Smith High School, a fee-paying Protestant institution sponsored by the Church of Ireland, known then and now simply as The High School. Today it is co-educational and located in Rathgar, but in 1904 it was a boys' school on Harcourt Street in south central Dublin, not very far from the Bloom family's house.",
    "expandedNote": " Oxen of the Sun recalls the teenage Bloom, \"precociously manly, walking on a nipping morning from the old house in Clanbrassil street to the high school, his booksatchel on him bandolierwise, and in it a goodly hunk of wheaten loaf, a mother’s thought.\" The walk from Clanbrassil Street to the school was less than a mile, perhaps about one kilometer. \n Founded in 1870 by the Erasmus Smith Trust (Smith was a 17th century English merchant who practiced educational philanthropy), The High School originally sought to prepare boys for careers in business. In Lotus Eaters, though, Bloom thinks of the science he studied with Mr. Vance as part of \"The college curriculum.\" Gifford observes that \"High schools in the national school system were primarily vocational in their emphasis, but the possibility of a 'college curriculum' (i.e., college preparatory course) was enhanced in 1878 (when Bloom was twelve) by the establishment of a Board of Intermediate Education, which held annual examinations and distributed subsidies to secondary schools according to the results.\" \n Bloom did not go on to college, however. The same passage inOxen remembers him \"a year or so gone over, in his first hard hat (ah, that was a day!), already on the road, a fullfledged traveller for the family firm, equipped with an orderbook.\" Bloom was born in the spring of 1866, and Ithacarefers to \"his ultimate year at High School (1880).\" If young Bloom went into the family business immediately after graduating, this would make him only 14 years old. But the novel seems conflicted on this point. In Circe, as Bloom celebrates the \"Halcyon days\" with five classmates, he exclaims, \"Again! I feel sixteen! What a lark! Let’s ring all the bells in Montague street. (He cheers feebly.) Hurray for the High School!\" \n The novel memorializes several defining experiences in Bloom's years at The High School. Circe makes infamous a class \"excursion\" or field trip to the Poulaphouca waterfall, when Bloom may have wandered off from his classmates and masturbated in the woods. It also suggests that his affinity for imagining himself a woman dates to his performance as a \"female impersonator\" in a school production of the play Vice Versa.\n With a wonderful feeling for the mixture of adult intellectual growth and childish physical simplicity that characterizes the secondary school years, Ithaca notes Bloom's superlative \"execution of the half lever movement on the parallel bars in consequence of his abnormally developed abdominal muscles,\" his ability to project the highest stream of urine \"against the whole concurrent strength of the institution, 210 scholars,\" and his declaration to Percy Apjohn of \"his disbelief in the tenets of the Irish (protestant) church (to which his father Rudolf Virag (later Rudolph Bloom) had been converted from the Israelitic faith and communion in 1865 by the Society for promoting Christianity among the jews).\" This was of course the very church that ran the school, though The High School has a tradition of tolerating many faiths and even lack of faith.\n The school also figures in Nausicaa, when Gerty thinks that Reggie Wylie \"was going to go to Trinity college to study for a doctor when he left the high school like his brother W. E. Wylie who was racing in the bicycle races in Trinity college university.\" In the lives of the Protestant, upwardly mobile Wylies we glimpse a very different trajectory from that of Bloom."

  "010125hightide": {
    "note": " In Telemachus the \"boatman\" who is looking out over the water where a man drowned nine days earlier comments that the body \"will be swept up that way when the tide comes in about one\"—an expectation repeated in Lotus Eaters when M'Coy begs off of attending Paddy Dignam's 11:00-12:00 funeral because \"There's a drowning case at Sandycove may turn up and then the coroner and myself would have to go down if the body is found.\" Joyce had consulted his tide tables: on June 16 the high tide occurred at 12:42 PM. The slow rolling in of the tide also figures in Proteus and Nausicaa.",
    "expandedNote": " As the noon hour approaches in Proteus, Stephen is on Sandymount Strand, not far from the Pigeon House. At the beginning of the chapter he can see \"the nearing tide,\" and later he watches “the tide flowing quickly in on all sides, sheeting the lows of sand.” At the end of the chapter, as water starts to pool near him, he thinks \"At one, he said\" and imagines the \"corpse rising saltwhite from the undertow, bobbing landward.\"\n The novel returns to the same scene on Sandymount Strand in Nausicaa, and again the tide is rising, but now the water is much farther from shore. On any coast, high tides occur every 12 hours and 25 minutes. On 17 June 1904 this would have been a little after 1:00 AM. Nausicaa takes place between 8 and 9 in the evening, so more than four hours remain until high tide. In this context, the babysitters' alarm is greatly exaggerated when \"Jacky threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it. . . . And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because they were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned.\" The spot where the women are sitting will eventually be under water (later in the chapter Bloom thinks, \"Tide comes here. Saw a pool near her foot\"), but at the moment the waves are very far away."

  "040042backwardeye": {
    "note": " As Bloom raises the window blind in the bedroom he keeps his peripheral vision trained on Molly's perusal of the mail: \"his backward eye saw her glance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow.\" Although the verbal connection is slight, Gifford is almost certainly correct to hear in this sentence an echo of Edmund Spenser's cuckold Malbecco, who cannot escape the awareness of his wife's infidelity: \"Still fled he forward, looking backward still.\"",
    "expandedNote": " In book 3, canto 10 of Spenser's The Faerie Queene (1590), Malbecco is a miserly and jealous man who perpetually suspects his wife Hellenore of infidelity. She responds by running off with a flashy knight named Paridell, who abandons her after having his sexual fill, \"For having filcht her bels, her up he cast / To the wide world, and let her fly alone, / He nould be clogd. So had he servèd many one\" (stanza 35). Hellenore, left to her own devices, enacts an adult version of Snow White by moving in with a band of satyrs, \"With them as housewife ever to abide, / To milk their gotes, and make them cheese and bred, / And every one as commune good her handelèd\" (36). \n Looking for his wife, Malbecco runs into Paridell and, \"almost dead with feare,\" greets him fairly; Paridell tells him that he no longer cares for Hellenore and that she is living somewhere in the forest (37-38). Concerned for his wife's safety, Malbecco plunges into the forest and finds \"Faire Hellenore, with girlonds all bespred, / Whom their May-lady they had newly made\" (44). When night comes, all the satyrs kiss Hellenore. Malbecco creeps closer, his sprouting cuckold's horns making him indistinguishable among the goats, and watches her current partner perform:\n At night, when all they went to sleepe, he vewd,\n Whereas his lovely wife emongst them lay,\n Embracèd of a Satyre rough and rude,\n Who all the night did minde his joyous play:\n Nine times he heard him come aloft ere day,\n That all his hart with gealosie did swell;\n But yet that nights ensample did bewray,\n That not for nought his wife them loved so well,\n When one so oft a night did ring his matins bell. (48)\n Malbecco wakes his wife in the morning and tries to persuade her to return with him, all her trespasses forgiven. She refuses and he ignominiously retreats, at first on hands and knees with the goats, and then rapidly on foot: \"Still fled he forward, looking backward still\" (56). At last he throws himself off a cliff to die, but jealousy has wasted his substance to nothing and he becomes a purely allegorical monster named Gealosie. \n Bloom is neither a miser nor pathologically jealous, but other details of Malbecco's story fit his situation all too well. The satyr's sexual prowess, which shows clearly \"That not for nought his wife them loved so well,\" has obvious relevance to Boylan's ability to satisfy Molly repeatedly in a way that Bloom can no longer manage even once. And Malbecco's timidity before Paridell makes a reader think of Bloom's inability or unwillingness to confront Boylan. Bloom's complicity in the adultery, and Molly's evident desire to have him know what she is doing, are captured in the moment when she very ineffectively conceals Boylan's letter while he simultaneously looks away and gives her \"his backward eye,\" in a kind of sorry inversion of the wish-fulfillment principle."

    "note": " Early in Proteus, Stephen thinks of his feet as being \"in his boots\" at \"the ends of his legs.\" Near the end of the episode, he looks down at \"a buck's castoffs\" and thinks of \"hismy sandal shoon.\" His lower body is covered in Mulligan's hand-me-down pants and shoes: Mulligan has asked Stephen in Telemachus, \"How are the secondhand breeks?\" (Scots dialect for trousers), and in Nestor Stephen has recalled that he also owes Mulligan \"one pair brogues.\" His body is not entirely his own. It is a protean assemblage of parts connected to other people, and this fact bespeaks trust in human connection as much as alienation.",
    "expandedNote": " The fact that Stephen can see nothing of his lower moiety but someone else's belongings, together with his chronic alienation from his own body, may explain the strangely distancing way in which Proteus repeatedly focuses on \"his legs,\" \"his feet,\" \"his boots,\" \"his treading soles\"—as if \"he\" and \"his\" are not quite on speaking terms. This intimate non-dialogue between brain and feet becomes entertainingly visible when Stephen realizes thathe has decided not to visit his aunt and uncle-in-law: \"He halted. I have passed the way to aunt Sara's. Am I not going there? Seems not.\" In this ready acquiescence to what his legs have done, one can perhaps hear some nascent trust in the unconscious body, some reassuring indication of Stephen's ability to journey out of his own mind into the mysterious world of the flesh.\n [2015] Despite his hyper-intellectual distance from his body, the novel often shows Stephen sanely aware of his physical connectedness to other people—as when his blood rises in response to Mulligan's cavalier remark about his mother, or when he wishes for a woman to \"Touch me.\" In Proteus, having recalled his experiences with Kevin Egan in Paris, he lies back against the rocks to take a nap, tips his hat down over his eyes, and realizes that he has unconsciously adopted one of Egan's physical habits: \"That is Kevin Egan's movement I made, nodding for his nap, sabbath sleep.\" Whatever Egan has or has not meant to him as an exile, or a believer, or a sexual being, or a bohemian drinker, Stephen has incorporated part of him into his own physical nature. His recollection of Egan's friendly greeting and his realization that he has taken some of Egan into himself join with other details at the end of Proteus—his yearning for a woman's touch, his expectation that \"Evening will find itself\" in his day's wanderings—to suggest that Stephen's mood is arcing toward trust."

  "020063nightmare": {
    "note": " Feeling that some \"wisdom\" is being expected of him in Nestor (and not just sardonic replies), Stephen weighs an answer to the triumphalist version of history that he has been hearing from Deasy: benighted Jews eternally cursed by enlightened Christians, anarchic fenians held at bay by resoluteTories, spendthrift Catholics bested at the bank by thrifty Protestants. His counter-vision is a simple statement of despair: \"History . . . is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.\" The metaphor implies that human history is no place to look for enlightenment or justice.",
    "expandedNote": " Citing a note by J. Prescott, Thornton finds an analogue to Stephen's statement in a letter of the French poet Jules Laforgue (1860-87): \"Life is too sad, too coarse. History is a gaudy old nightmare who does not suspect that the best jokes are the shortest.\" (I.e., get them over with as quickly as possible, because there is not very much to relish in the telling?) Robert Spoo quotes several early 20th century writers who used the same image in relation to World War I: D. H. Lawrence made it the title of a chapter on the war in Kangaroo (1923); Yeats wrote in Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen, \"Now days are dragon-ridden, the nightmare / Rides upon sleep\"; and, remarkably like Stephen's sentence, Henry James wrote in a letter to Edith Wharton in 1914 that \"Life goes on after a fashion, but I find it a nightmare from which there is no waking save by sleep.\" (The letter was not published until 1920, so Joyce could not have been thinking of it as he wroteNestor, any more than the other two. But all these uses of the same image suggest that it was widely current in the culture of the time.)\n In addition to the war, one can identify many reasons Stephen might have for thinking of life as nightmarish, including British colonialism, the long and depressing saga of Irish resistance and acquiescence, and many other kinds of national, ethnic, and religious hatred, one of which he has just been thinking about in connection with the Jews. The word \"history\" is often attached to such struggles in Ulysses. Haines has said in Telemachus, and Stephen thinks again in Nestor, that \"history is to blame\" for England's brutal subjugation of the Irish. Stephen has thought at the beginning of Nestor that for Irish leaders \"history was a tale like any other too often heard, their land a pawnshop.\" In Aeolus Myles Crawford refers to the story of the Phoenix Park murders as \"the whole bloody history,\" and Stephen thinks, \"Nightmare from which you will never awake.\" In Cyclops Bloom inveighs against \"Persecution\" and says that \"all the history of the world is full of it. Perpetuating national hatred among nations.\" \" Force, hatred, history,\" he says, \"all that. That's not life for men and women, insult and hatred.\" And in Eumaeus Stephen asks Bloom to remove a knife from his sight because \"It reminds me of Roman history.\" \n Nightmares also play an ongoing role in the book, from Haines' black panther to Dennis Breen's ace of spades to Bloom's fears about sleep. Circe can be described as (among other things) a long nightmare, during the course of which both Bloom and Stephen valiantly struggle to \"awake.\""

  "010141blamehistory": {
    "note": " Haines' guilt about the Irish history that Stephen experiences as a nightmare, and that his own nightmare perhaps has something to do with, comes out of his mouth reeking of British imperial euphemism (“We feel in England that we have treated you rather unfairly”) and evasion of responsibility (“It seems history is to blame”). But at least he does feel guilt.",
    "expandedNote": " It is easy to scorn Haines' manner, and Joyce doubtless intends for his reader to do so. In Scylla and Charybdis Stephen thinks of him as a \"Penitent thief.\" But Stephen’s prickly resentment does not necessarily appear to much better advantage than Haines’ suave unconsciousness, and as he smokes Haines' tobacco he reflects \"that the cold gaze which had measured him was not all unkind.\"\n If Haines is like Trench, his English family is descended from members of the Anglo-Irish Ascendancy, and he is returning to the land of his ancestors not simply as a tourist (though he certainly is that), but as an expatriate motivated by nostalgia and admiration for Irish traditions. His admission that England has treated Ireland unfairly aligns him with the Liberal politicians who worked to atone for past injustices in various 19th century British Parliaments. In the last few decades of the century this liberal guilt produced some incremental land reform in Ireland, and it very nearly produced Home Rule under the leadership of Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone, who makes an appearance in Circe as \"Grave Gladstone.\""

  "020016hockey": {
    "note": " It is probably significant that the boys at Mr. Deasy's school play \"Hockey,\" rather than the Irish game of hurling. The two sports are similar, but hockey is English. Its place in the curriculum marks one more way in which the school is inculcating Unionist values.",
    "expandedNote": " Although its origins are ancient, field hockey assumed its modern form in the 19th century in English public schools. The more rugged and dangerous sport of hurling has been a part of Irish life for thousands of years, sharing many features (field, goals, number of players, some terminology) with Gaelic football. The Gaelic Athletic Association sought to revive it as part of the broader Celtic Revival, and its efforts proved hugely successful over the course of the 20th century. \n Nationalist political implications aside, hockey will do just as well as hurling, slightly later in the chapter, for conveying Joyce's view that field sports are \"mimic warfare\" preparing boys for battle."

The shop now lives on Dawson Street.",

  "050047hokypoky": {
    "note": " In Lotus Eaters Bloom thinks of \"Hokypoky penny a lump,\" and later chapters show this mysterious substance being sold on the streets by Italian vendors. It was a form of cheap frozen ice that, like other ices and ice creams of its day, had been implicated in many outbreaks of disease in Europe and America.",
    "expandedNote": " Wandering Rocks shows the onelegged sailor near Eccles Street \"skirting Rabaiotti's icecream car,\" which is probably setting off for the day from nearby Madras Place where Antoni Rabaiotti, Gifford notes, \"had a fleet of pushcarts that sold ices and ice cream in the Dublin streets.\"Circe begins with people on the edge of the Monto district, considerably south and east, grouped around this cart or a similar one: \"Round Rabaiotti's halted ice gondola stunted men and women squabble. They grab wafers between which are wedged lumps of coral and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly.\" In Eumaeus Bloom and Stephen pass the same small cart: \"Adjacent to the men's public urinal they perceived an icecream car round which a group of presumably Italians in heated altercation were getting rid of voluble expressions.\" The novel's association of this cart with uncleanliness and ill health—Circemoves on to glance at St. Vitus' dance, often caused by streptococcal infections, and at a \"scrofulous child,\" suffering from tuberculosis—can hardly be accidental. \n The last three decades of the 19th century saw a fad for cheap flavored ices called \"hokey pokey.\" In a note on JJON, Harald Beck quotes from several newspaper articles around the year 1880 referring to this newly popular product. The 21 July 1878 issue of Era referred to a music hall song featuring language identical to Bloom's: \"Mr Wilfred Roxby [...] sang a funny strain of an amatory kind with a chorus about a street vendor who sold 'Hokey-pokey, a penny a lump.'\" An 1881 issue of Tinsley's Magazine defined the term for those unfamiliar with it: \"Hokey-pokey was the vulgar name for 'ice-cream sold on the street,' she explained, and she had tasted some at an open-air hokey-pokey stall near the Liverpool 'depot' for one penny.\" The 3 December 1881Manchester Times listed the ingredients: \"The genuine article is said to be composed of milk, cornflour, sugar, and eggs, all boiled together, and afterwards frozen into small lumps.\" \n Rich, whipped concoctions of the kind that bear the name ice cream today did exist in the 19th century, but they were too expensive for poor people. The \"ice cream\" sold on the streets typically contained no cream at all and would have been more like today's ice pops or ice lollies. In the early years, people consumed these ices from small \"penny lick\" glasses whose conical shape and thick walls made the amounts appear greater than they were and whose regular re-use (they were simply wiped out and refilled) made countless people sick. By the turn of the century cities had begun banning the unsanitary glasses, and vendors started serving ices between \"wafers,\" as noted at the beginning of Circe. (Joyce's fanciful adjectives—\"lumps of coral and copper snow\"—refer to the colors that were added to identify particular flavors.) An Italian vendor in New York City introduced paper cups in 1896, and there are reports of British ices being rolled up in brown paper cones, but edible waffle cones did not appear until the St. Louis World's Fair in 1904. \n By the time Ulysses was published, hokey-pokey carts were a thing of the past. The 4 November 1919 London Times described them as unsavory memories of a vanished Dublin: \"Time flies and Dublin can no longer be looked at by the nose.A main drainage system has exorcised the Liffey, and the red-herring basket is as scarce as that of the cockle seller of old, a legend now, or the more distant hokey-pokey-a-penny-a-lump man, who is not even believed in by children.\" It may seem odd to link ice cream with the open sewer that was the Liffey, or with the rank smells of unrefrigerated seafood, but the connection was entirely justified. Throughout the second half of the 19th century ice cream consumption was repeatedly implicated in outbreaks of severe illness, and street ices were among the worst offenders. \n In an article titled \"When Ice Cream Was Poisonous: Adulteration, Ptomaines, and Bacteriology in the United States, 1850-1910,\" Bulletin of the History of Medicine 86.3 (2012): 333-60, Edward Geist summarizes some of the appalling reports, which started with the invention of the hand-cranked ice cream freezer in 1843 but became much worse in the 1880s: \"During the 1880s ice cream poisoning grew from an isolated phenomenon to reach epidemic proportions. . . . By the middle of the decade, ice cream poisoning had become the subject of popular jokes\" (343-44). The many cases, sometimes involving hundreds of victims, prompted intense debate about the causes. Chemical or metallic adulterants, \"ptomaines\" supposedly produced by bacteria digesting food products, and bacteria themselves were all theorized to be responsible, but as time went on the evidence pointed more and more conclusively to bacteria, and specifically to bacterial contamination of milk. \n Geist pays only scant attention to the hokey-pokey ices of British street carts, but it is likely that the appallingly unsanitary conditions under which they were made, and what he calls \"the notorious practice of refreezing unsold melted ice cream and serving it to unsuspecting customers\" (340) the next day, made a universal problem much worse. He notes that \"in 1898 Modern Medicine stated that 'as a result of eating ice-cream obtained at a street-stand in Antwerp, forty persons, most of them children, died'\" (334). Around the turn of the century, he notes, researchers isolated from samples of cheese a demonstrably pathogenic strain of the colon bacterium now famously known as Escherichia coli. On flickr.com a blogger named Paul Townsend notes that Victorian and Edwardian physicians linked ice cream products to scarlet fever (Streptococcus pyogenes) in 1875, to \"Gaertner\" infection (Bacillus enteriditis) in 1905 and 1909, and to typhoid fever (Salmonella enterica) in 1892, 1894, 1897, and 1904. Tuberculosis too was known to be spread by contaminated milk. \n At the beginning of Circe Joyce casts only a quick glance at such communicable diseases, but it is one of many such glances in the novel, consistent with Bloom's thoughts about unsanitary eating implements in Lestrygonians (\"A pallid suetfaced young man polished his tumbler knife fork and spoon with his napkin. New set of microbes\"), his wariness of communal sources of food and drink slightly later in the same chapter (\"My plate's empty. After you with our incorporated drinking cup. Like sir Philip Crampton’s fountain. Rub off the microbes with your handkerchief. Next chap rubs on a new batch with his\"), and his recollection of infected shellfish in Nausicaa (\"Poor man O’Connor wife and five children poisoned by mussels here.The sewage. Hopeless\"). Such quick glances take for granted the impoverished, dirty, foul-smelling, unhealthy city that was Dublin in 1904. They also show Joyce's interest in recent medical research that might eventually benefit not only Deasy's precious cattle (\"Foot and mouth disease. Known as Koch's preparation. Serum and virus. Percentage of salted horses. Rinderpest\"), but Ireland's human inhabitants as well.\n Many thanks to Vincent Van Wyk, who, in a personal communication, suggested resources consulted in this note."

    "note": " In Hades Bloom thinks that a young medical student named Dixon who treated him at the Mater hospital has moved to \"the lying-in hospital,\" and in Lestrygonians Josie Breen tells him that Mina Purefoy is in her third day of labor at the lying-in hospital \"in Holles street.\" The establishment is not named until Oxen of the Sun, whose action takes place \"in the commons' hall of the National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles street.\" In Ithaca, when Bloom and Stephen discuss places to meet in the future, this phrase is repeated verbatim. In addition to the NMH there were two other major Dublin hospitals dedicated to obstetrics and gynecology, a fact which elicits patriotic comment in Oxen of the Sun.",
    "expandedNote": " The NMH was, and is, one of three large maternity hospitals in Dublin. Oxen mentions that it has \"seventy beds\" for laboring women, and that 300 babies are delivered each year: \"in twelve moons thrice an hundred.\" The second number, averaging to not even one child per day, seems low. Today, so many babies are delivered at the hospital (over 9,000 per year) that a move to larger premises is being explored. The hospital lies just north of the Merrion Square park, a location that is highlighted in Oxen as a rainstorm moves in: \"In Ely place, Baggot street, Duke's lawn, thence through Merrion green up to Holles street a swash of water flowing that was before bonedry.\" The sentence describes a storm track moving from southwest to northeast. \n The NMH forms a major reference point in the 16 June 1904 action of Ulysses, chiefly because Mrs. Purefoy is giving birth there. But did Molly Bloom likewise give birth at this hospital? Both Gifford (79) and Igoe (290) assume that she did, and it seems possible that Joyce did as well. But Milly was born in June 1889 and Rudy in December 1893, while the NMH was founded in March 1894. The stone plaque over the hospital's entrance supports this dating, as do numerous documentary sources. Among them is a Charter Amendment Act passed in 1936, which begins, \"WHEREAS the National Maternity Hospital situate in Holles Street in the City of Dublin was founded in the year 1894 for the relief of poor lying-in women and for the treatment of diseases peculiar to women . . .\" But there is some contrary evidence. The hospital has been led by 18 Masters since its founding (Professor Shane Higgins began his service as the 18th Master earlier this year), and the list stretches back to a William Roe who served from 1885 to 1893. I have not yet been able to resolve this contradiction.\n § The NMH, which today is the largest obstretrics hospital in Ireland, was a relative latecomer, the third such facility to be established in Dublin. The Rotunda Hospital, on the north side of the city, was founded in 1745 and incorporated by royal charter in 1756. It moved to its present location on Rutland (Parnell) Square in 1757 and still operates today. Gifford notes that, according to Thom's directory, in 1904 it was \"the largest chartered Clinical School of Midwifery and Gynaecology in the United Kingdom\" (409). The Coombe Lying-in Hospital was founded in 1826 and received a royal charter in 1867. Originally located in the Liberties on Heytesbury Street, it moved to nearby Cork Street in 1967, and likewise is still in business. Together these three hospitals deliver an impressive 27,000 babies each year, or about 25 babies per hospital per day. (In 2014, according to the Central Statistics Office of Ireland, the numbers were NMH 9,231, Rotunda 8,913, and Coombe 8,768.)\n Ireland's long history of committing resources to the care of women in labor, including ones who cannot afford expensive medical care, amply justifies the view, expressed in the tortured language at the outset of Oxen of the Sun, that \"by no exterior splendour is the prosperity of a nation more efficaciously asserted than by the measure of how far forward may have progressed the tribute of its solicitude for that proliferent continuance which of evils the original if it be absent when fortunately present constitutes the certain sign of omnipollent nature's incorrupted benefaction.\" (Whew!) The next paragraph of Oxen, commenting on Irish doctors of the distant past, observes that \"a plan was by them adopted\" to remove \"maternity\" as far as could be managed \"from all accident possibility,\" providing whatever was needed \"not solely for the copiously opulent\" but also for women who are not \"sufficiently moneyed.\""

    "note": " As Mr. Deasy counts out Stephen's wages in Nestor, Stephen's \"embarrassed hand\" passes over a collection of sea shells that the old man keeps in a \"cold stone mortar,\" including one that Stephen thinks of as \"the scallop of St. James.\" A scallop shell is the symbol associated with St. James the Greater, whose shrine at Compostela, Spain, has drawn many thousands of religious pilgrims from the Middle Ages to the present—hence Stephen's fancy that the mortar full of shells is \"An old pilgrim's hoard.\"",
    "expandedNote": " Compostela lies near the sea, in Galicia, and pilgrims apparently got in the habit of bringing a shell with them as they returned inland. \"Being light and small in size, the scallop shell was ideal for gathering water from a spring or improvising tableware at the side of the path\" (www.mscvocations.com). In time, pilgrims who had completed the journey got in the habit of wearing a scallop shell on their clothing as a badge, symbolizing their spiritual accomplishment. It appears that Mr. Deasy too is in the habit of walking along the shore in his own seaside village, collecting beautiful shells. \n But for this materialistic pilgrim the shells do not (Stephen thinks) symbolize religious observance. They are a \"hoard, dead treasure, hollow shells,\" their hollowness suggesting (in part, perhaps, because of the expression \"money cowries\") the emptiness of the old man's obsession with money. Money is no less symbolic than scallop shells are, and Stephen thinks of the payment being handed to him too as \"hollow shells. Symbols too of beauty and of power. A lump in my pocket: symbols soiled by greed and misery.\" Possibly the reader should also make a connection between this \"dead treasure\" and the image of Sargent as a snail about to be crushed under the world's tramping feet, for if Mr. Deasy is an old militarist sending young men out into the fray of battle, then he makes \"hollow shells\" of human lives as well.\n Stephen's meditations on shells continue in Proteus, beginning with the Deasy-connected fancy that they are \"Wild sea money.\""

  "050023holywater": {
    "note": " The \"cold black marble bowl\" beside which Bloom stands \"unseeing\" for a moment in Lotus Eaters as he adjusts to the daylight outside St. Andrew's, \"while before him and behind two worshippers dipped furtive hands in the low tide of holy water,\" is the font in the church's entrance porch. He stands near another such \"font\" at the entrance of the mortuary chapel in Hades, and then watches as the priest shakes some droplets over Dignam's coffin: \"Holy water that was, I expect.\" Many Catholic churches dispense holy water—water that has been sanctified by a priest's blessing—to worshipers in basins stationed at the entrance. Priests also administer it in baptisms, funerals, exorcisms, and blessings.",
    "expandedNote": " Gifford explains the ritual function of the basins: \"Traditionally, worshipers dip the first and second fingers of the right hand in the water and touch their foreheads or cross themselves on entering and leaving the church\" (97). This ongoing wetting reenacts the original sanctification of baptism, and holy water is thought to cleanse venial sins. Jacquelyn Lindsey's Catholic Family Prayer Book (2001) supplies a prayer to utter while anointing onself: \"By this Holy water and by your Precious Blood, wash away all my sins O Lord\" (65). \n Priests can also dispense holy water with a short metal stick with a knob on the end of it that Bloom, in Hades, calls \"a stick with a knob at the end of it.\" The church prefers to call this liturgical implement an aspergillum (or aspergill, aspergilium), which can take the form either of a knobbed stick or a brush. It assigns the name of aspersorium to the \"brass bucket,\" held by a server, from which Bloom sees Father Coffey lift his water-loaded stick. As with worshipers dipping their fingers into a font, these ritual sprinklings commemorate the believer's original sanctification. Gifford quotes the Layman's Missal to the effect that the holy water sprinkled over the coffin by the celebrant recalls \"the water that flowed over the deceased person's head at baptism\" (118). \n The buckets and basins appear to have figured as strongly in Joyce's imagination as the water they contain. As William York Tindall observed in his caption to the photograph of the font at the entrance to St. Andrew's, figures of containment (cups, pots, tubs) pervadeLotus Eaters. These images contribute to a mood of safety and comfort consistent with the chapter's many references to intoxicating pallatives. For Catholic believers a basin of holy water or ciborium of wafers offers the powerful physical reassurance that exhausted horses find in feedbags, weak swimmers in the Dead Sea, thirsty travelers in jars of cool water, alcohol enthusiasts in pints, afflicted sufferers in compounding mortars, and questing sceptres in gold cups. At the end of the chapter, Bloom pulls together all of this imagery, and indicates a nodding awareness of its ultimate source, as he imagines lying in a \"clean trough of water\" at the Turkish baths: \"He foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full, naked, in a womb of warmth, oiled by scented melting soap, softly laved.\" \n One final thought about fonts of holy water, admittedly tangential, perhaps deserves mention: they have been shown to harbor bacteria and viruses capable of causing human infections. An 1898 study by bacteriologists publishing in the Dietetic and Hygienic Gazette (14: 578) found staph, strep, E. coli, and diptheria-causing bacilli in samples of holy water taken from an Italian church. A 1995 study in the Journal of Hospital Infection (32: 51-55) prompted by the bacterial infection of a burn victim who had been treated with holy water found a similarly \"wide range of bacterial species,\" some of them implicated in human illness. During the swine flu epidemic of 2009 the bishop of Fresno, California ordered that fonts be emptied of holy water, and an Italian church installed a motion-activated device that dispenses holy water automatically, like sinks in an airport restroom. It would seem that in some instances holy water, rather than warding off evils, may introduce them into the human organism.\n Such considerations do not figure in Lotus Eaters orHades, but Bloom is well aware of the public health aspects of microbial transmission. In Lestrygonians he reflects that the basins of potable water at the base of \"sir Philip Crampton's fountain\" may spread \"microbes\" among users. By 1898 bacteriologists had subjected church fonts to the same sort of scrutiny, and one can easily imagine Joyce taking pleasure in this irreverent intersection of religion and science."

  "040006homerulesun": {
    "note": " The logo of the morning newspaper that Bloom works for, the Freeman's Journal, did indeed show \"a homerule sun rising up in the northwest from the laneway behind the bank of Ireland,\" as he thinks in Calypso. Arthur Griffith's witty observation of that fact is consistent with the spirit of irreverent mockery that Dubliners bring to their urban landmarks and even to the most sacred subjects. But it also expresses some particular nationalist disdain for this newspaper.",
    "expandedNote": " Even if the geography was wrong, there were good iconographic reasons for the composition of the image. The Freeman's Journal was a leading nationalist newspaper, with a history of espousing Irish independence that stretched back for nearly 150 years. And \"the bank of Ireland\" was not chosen as a site for the rising of the \"homerule sun\" because of its commercial symbolism. This grand building in the heart of Dublin was the meeting place of the Irish parliament until that body was abolished by the Act of Union in 1800, after which (now useless) it was sold to the Bank of Ireland. Its splendid facade faces southeast, so the creator of the image had little choice but to place his symbolic sun where he did.\n But in the later 19th century the Freeman's editorial positions had become more conservative, and it had come to be associated with the intransigent status quo. The paper consistently gave more opposition than support to Charles Stewart Parnell's Home Rule movement in the 1870s and 80s. Different anti-Parnellite factions strugged for control of the paper after its 1892 merger with the National Press, and by 1904 the editor, Thomas Sexton, had largely renounced the cause of parliamentary reform.\n Griffith's joke, then, probably reflects more than simply the irreverent spirit of Irish wit. As an ardent and active nationalist who headed his own newspaper, The United Irishman, and who eventually became the first President of the Irish Free State in 1922, Griffith undoubtedly shared the jaded view of the Freeman held by many Dubliners. To Myles Crawford (affectionately) and the Citizen (contemptuously), it is \"the old woman of Prince's street.\""

  "140036hoopsaboyaboy": {
    "note": " \"Hoopsa boyaboy hoopsa!\": this third verse in the chant that opens Oxen maps the Arval Brothers' \"Triumphe!\" onto the modern cry of a midwife bouncing a male baby into its new life.",
    "expandedNote": " In James Joyce's Ulysses (1930), Stuart Gilbert writes that this \"is the triumphant cry of the midwife as, elevating the new-born, she acclaims its sex\" (277). Gifford adds that the midwife is apparently bouncing the baby \"to stabilize its breathing.\" A newborn may need some help to start drawing its first breaths of air. Today doctors quickly suction the airway to remove any fluid, but a traditional method was to lift the child by its ankles and slap it on the buttocks, using gravity to dislodge the fluid. Whatever the method employed in Horne's hospital, Joyce's \"hoopsa\" does seem to take us to the endpoint of labor: a healthy, screaming child.\n The progressive evolution of prose styles in Oxen of the Sun parallels the passage of time waiting for Mina Purefoy to give birth, and Joyce seems to have intended an analogy between the development of English prose and the development of a fetus. A 20 March 1920 letter to Frank Budgensays so, and the schemas which he gave to Linati and Gilbert identify the \"technique\" of this chapter as \"embryonic development.\" How exactly one should understand the details of this analogy is a very uncertain business, but the narrative of the chapter does build to the delivery of Mrs. Purefoy's baby, and the chaotic, choppy, colloquial non-style of its final pages can plausibly be heard as resembling the cries of a newborn. Joyce predicts the end of his episode at its beginning, in the conclusion of the chant."

  "050028hoppy": {
    "note": " In a book stuffed to the rafters with minor characters, \"Hoppy Holohan\" is one of the most minor. Joyce probably based him on an actual person that he learned about from Nora, but biographical information about this person has not been found. Holohan plays a fairly important (though ignominious) role in the Dubliners story \"A Mother,\" but in Ulysses he is reduced to having two people ask two other people whether they know him.",
    "expandedNote": " \"A Mother\" begins with a paragraph introducing him: \"Mr Holohan, assistant secretary of the Eire Abu Society, had been walking up and down Dublin for nearly a month, with his hands and pockets full of dirty pieces of paper, arranging about the series of concerts. He had a game leg and for this his friends called him Hoppy Holohan. He walked up and down constantly, stood by the hour at street corners arguing the point and made notes; but in the end it was Mrs Kearney who arranged everything.\" \n In Lotus Eaters M'Coy learns that Bloom is going to Paddy Dignam's funeral and says, \"I only heard it last night. Who was telling me? Holohan. You know Hoppy?\" Bloom replies, \"I know.\" In Aeolus Mr. O'Madden Burke, who lends moral support to Holohan in \"A Mother\" when he has his falling out with Mrs. Kearney, discusses details of the Phoenix Park murders with Myles Crawford and says, \"Holohan told me. You know Holohan?\" Crawford replies, \"Hop and carry one, is it?\" In Circe Holohan fills a small and purely choral role. He has one line: \"Good old Bloom! There’s nobody like him after all.\"\n Vivien Igoe writes that a man of the same name \"was mentioned in a letter from a suspicious Joyce to Nora dated 7 August 1909. Holohan appeared as a guest in Finn's Hotel in Leinster Street where the 19-year-old Nora worked as a chambermaid in the early months of 1904. He tried unsuccessfully to seduce her. Holohan could well have served as the model for the Holohan in Joyce's fiction.\""

  "050043horseywomen": {
    "note": " In Lotus Eaters Bloom watches a stylishly dressed woman who is about to mount a jaunting car and thinks of her \"caste,\" which is unmistakably upper-crust. She reminds him of \"that haughty creature at the polo match,\" and in Lestrygonians he returns to thoughts of \"those horsey women\" of the Anglo-Irish landed gentry who \"Swagger around livery stables\" and ride to the hounds. They intimidate him, both because of their wealthy disdain for commoners and because of the sexual power implied by bestriding large beasts. In Circe his fantasy of sexually taming such powerful women gives way to masochistic surrender as three rich society ladies accuse him of intolerable improprieties.",
    "expandedNote": " The woman in Lotus Eaters stands waiting \"while the man, husband, brother, like her,\" scours his pockets for a tip for the hotel porter. Bloom notices the \"roll collar\" of her coat, the \"patch pockets,\" the heavy wool cloth, as well as the haughty look and the \"Careless stand of her.\" Everything screams money. His aggressive response is to fantasize about bringing this haughty creature down to his level by touching the \"spot\": \"Women all for caste till you touch the spot. Handsome is and handsome does. Reserved about to yield. The honourable Mrs and Brutus is an honourable man. Possess her once take the starch out of her.\" \n § The high-society label The Honourable Mr. or Mrs. So-and-So shows up often in Ulysses, most notably in Circe when it is applied to one of Bloom's three outraged female accusers. Here in Lotus Eaters, it prompts him to remember how Marc Antony repeatedly calls Brutus an honourable man in his funeral speech in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar.The allusion is entirely consistent with Bloom's fantasy of gaining power through sexual conquest, because Antony too stands on the outside looking in, feeling hostile to Rome's new rulers. He first speaks the words \"Brutus is an honourable man\" deferentially, from a position of weakness, but the phrase gains murderous power through sardonic repetition, inciting the crowd of plebeians to revenge.\n § The revery in Lestrygonians explores the strength that Bloom sees in ascendancy women. He imagines the kind of sentence he might read in the Irish Field, a newspaper for the country gentry that reported on horse races: \"Lady Mountcashel has quite recovered after her confinement and rode out with the Ward Union staghounds at the enlargement yesterday at Rathoath.\" Clearly the recently pregnant, imaginary Lady Mountcashel is no delicate flower. \"Riding astride. Sit her horse like a man. Weightcarrying huntress. No sidesaddle or pillion for her, not for Joe. First to the meet and in at the death. Strong as a brood mare some of those horsey women. Swagger around livery stables. Toss off a glass of brandy neat while you'd say knife. That one at the Grosvenor this morning. Up with her on the car: wishswish. Stonewall or fivebarred gate put her mount to it.\" \n Remembering the woman at the Grosvenor makes him think of another society dame, Mrs. Miriam Dandrade, who with no sign of a blush sold him her old underclothes, in her hotel room, \"As if I was her clotheshorse. . . . Want to be a bull for her. Born courtesan. No nursery work for her, thanks.\" These women are not about meekly submitting to their husbands and contentedly sacrificing their lives to their children. They are about personal power, and Bloom supposes that they must like power in bed too—the power of being serviced by a \"bull.\" But here his fantasy of domination breaks down in \"Want,\" because he is no such master of the copulative art. With Molly, at least, he has not managed even a simulacrum of it for over ten years. \n This unspoken confession of incapacity, even impotency, informs the passage in Circe in which Mrs. Yelverton Barry, Mrs. Bellingham, and Mrs. Mervyn Talboys humiliate Bloom in court by testifying to the unwanted attentions he has paid them. The first two appear in exceedingly elegant urban attire, and equestrian echoes sound only faintly in Mrs. Yelverton Barry's diction: \"He wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James Lovebirch.\" But when \"The Honourable Mrs. Talboys\" appears, the horsey woman theme blares forth:\n (In amazon costume, hard hat, jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets with braided drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she strikes her welt constantly.) Also me. Because he saw me on the polo ground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of Ireland. . . . He implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most vicious horsewhipping.\n She declares great willingness to horsewhip:\n(Stamps her jingling spurs in a sudden paroxysm of fury.) I will, by the God above me. I'll scourge the pigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him. I'll flay him alive. . . . Pigdog and always was ever since he was pupped! To dare address me! I'll flog him black and blue in the public streets. I'll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel. He is a wellknown cuckold. (She swishes her huntingcrop savagely in the air.) Take down his trousers without loss of time. Come here, sir! Quick! Ready?\n Bloom's response to the woman at the Grosvenor shows that Ulysses remains, in Kevin Birmingham's words, a \"dangerous book.\" The sexual content of his fantasy, powered in this instance by strong currents of class antagonism, can offend today's smug, censorious, and hyper-vigilant guardians of political correctness no less surely than it offended their Edwardian cousins, the policers of obscenity. But Bloom is no rapist, and Circe's transmutation of his fantasy of domination into a fantasy of being dominated indicates a complex psychology that fully respects, and even celebrates, female agency. \n In Nora: The Real Life of Molly Bloom, Brenda Madox cites a relevant incident from the life of the newlywed Joyces: \"Nora took to sexual intercourse with enthusiasm and imagination. Often she took the lead, as she had in their courtship. . . . Joyce was delighted but slightly overwhelmed.One night, naked, she straddled him like a horse, urging, 'Fuck up, love! fuck up, love!' Her behavior fulfilled all his dreams of domination by a fierce woman, and that Nora could release such fervor only three weeks after initiation left him with a lasting sense of awe at the banked fires of female desire\" (57)."

  "150012houri": {
    "note": " Bloom calls Zoe \"houri,\" a Persian and Arabic word which has no relation to the English \"whore.\" Houris are the voluptuous young women who, according to the Quran, consort with virtuous men in the afterlife.",
    "expandedNote": " The OED lists early uses of the word in Samuel Johnson's playIrene (1730s) and Byron's The Siege of Corinth (1816), both in plural forms indicating familiarity with the Islamic doctrine that believers who have observed prescribed rites and done good deeds will be rewarded with multiple physically perfect wives in paradise. Johnson: \"Suspend thy passage to the seats of bliss, / Nor wish for houries in Irene's arms.\" Byron: \"Secure in paradise to be / By Houris loved immortally.\" \n Joyce might have encountered the word in various English-language texts, but another detail in Circe suggests that he may have known something of its eastern origins. In another exchange with Zoe that occurs many pages earlier in the book but perhaps just a minute earlier in the conversation (their dialogue is interrupted by the long hallucinatory sequence in which Bloom becomes lord mayor, king, emperor, president, messiah, and mother), he says, \" I never loved a dear gazelle but it was sure to...,\" after which a stage direction notes that \"Gazelles are leaping, feeding on the mountains.\" \n Bloom's \"I never loved a dear gazelle\" alludes to a Thomas Moore poem and Lewis Carroll's parody of it. But the Arabic word 'ḥūr' (حُور) can be translated as \"gazelle-eyed.\" The OED translates two forms of the word as \"gazelle-like in the eyes\" and \"to be black-eyed like a gazelle.\"\n Might the mention of gazelles just before the dream sequence, and the mention of houris just after it, cohere with Jimmy Henry's observation that Bloom's enlightened rule inaugurates \"the year I of the Paradisiacal Era\"? That proclamation comes in the middle of the hallucination, at line 1632 of Gabler's lineated text, 310 lines after the references to gazelles and 357 lines before Bloom calls Zoe \"houri.\""

    "note": " Twice in Proteus, Stephen thinks metaphorically of houses. Concluding his reverie about Richie Goulding's house in Irishtown, he thinks, \"Houses of decay, mine, his and all. . . . Come out of them, Stephen. Beauty is not there.\" Later, he thinks of a saying about the medieval poet Guido Cavalcanti: \"But the courtiers who mocked Guido in Or san Michele were in their own house. House of...\" Both houses are \"houses of decay.\" The artist is engaged in a war against entropy.",
    "expandedNote": " As first noticed by Edmund Epstein in \"Cruxes in Ulysses: Notes Toward an Annotated Edition,\" The James Joyce Review 1 (1957): 25-36, the anecdote about \"Guido\" comes from a passage in Boccaccio's Decameron (6th day, 9th story) in which Guido Cavalcanti is brooding among the tombs around a church and some acquaintances mock him for his pensive solitude. Gifford quotes from the story: \"Guido, you refuse to be of our society; but, when you have found out that there is no god, what good will it have done you?\" Guido replies that they can say whatever they like to him, since they are in their own house. Thinking about his statement after he leaves, they realize that he means that their domain is Death: \"these arches are the abode of the dead, and he calls them our house to show us that we . . . are, in comparison with him and other men of letters, worse than dead men.\" \n Guido Cavalcanti (1250-1300) was a close friend and mentor of Dante Alighieri, and like him a troubadour poet who subjected love to rigorous logical analysis, seeking to understand its role in human life and the cosmos. Unlike Dante, he took little comfort in religious idealism, balancing a sense of love's spiritual exaltations with relentlessly scientific recognition of its limitations. Boccaccio's story of a somber contemplation of graves seems appropriate to this man who regularly looked emptiness in the face. Cavalcanti's reply to the courtiers (It is you who traffic in death, not I!) may express a belief that only those who are willing to examine their joys, and erect artistic structures to support them, can truly be said to live. Casual affirmation of life is really an acquiescence in our universal fate: death and decay. \n Thinking of how poor a figure he cuts beside Mulligan's aquatic heroism, Stephen mentally rehearses Boccaccio's story to justify himself, but decides that it will not help him out of his embarrassment: \"House of... We don't want any of your medieval abstrusiosities. Would you do what he did?\" The earlier passage, however (\"Houses of decay . . . Come out of them, Stephen. Beauty is not there\"), shows him pondering the Cavalcanti saying in a more useful way. In A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, Stephen had argued that \"When the soul of a man is born in this country there are nets flung at it to hold it back from flight. You talk to me of nationality, language, religion. I shall try to fly by those nets.\" Now, befitting the Protean theme, he thinks that to incarnate beauty he must extricate himself from the pockets of decay that would entrap him, and build his own house."

    "expandedNote": " The \"Howth tram\" ran from 1901 to 1959, on a route that departed from Fingal (just outside Dublin) and circled scenic Howth Head, which had few inhabitants outside the village of Howth on the northern coast of the peninsula. The cars featured an upper deck screened with wire mesh, as shown in the photos at right. \n Unless he was taking the tram to Howth to make a connection at the railway station with a train bound for some other part of Ireland (unlikely in his case, though this is the reason that the line was constructed), Stephen must have been engaged in a minor act of tourism, using the metropolitan network of trams to access a site of natural splendor not far from the city. \n § His ability to release his sexual longing into the relatively pristine air of such an environment identifies him with the novel's other two protagonists. Bloom has gone on a school trip to the Poulaphouca waterfall SW of Dublin and masturbated in the woods, for which he is accused in Circe by a grove of yew trees (\"Who profaned our silent shade?\"), and chastised by a nymph modeled on the one over his bed (\"O, infamy!\"). In Gibraltar, Molly has allowed Lieutenant Mulvey to fondle her as \"we lay over the firtree cove a wild place I suppose it must be the highest rock in existence.\" And both Blooms, soon to be Mr. and Mrs., have enjoyed a rapturous sexual idyll together \"lying among the rhododendrons on Howth head\" (Penelope). \n Stephen's hopeless cry of desire on the top of a train car, strangled by religious guilt and justified by misogyny (\"What else were they invented for?\"), looks pitiful by comparison to the more natural experiences of sexual passion that the Blooms have had in splendid surroundings. But all of these episodes cohere in expressing an association between Nature as landscape and human sexual nature. As Simon Dedalus says of a sexual encounter in Hades, \"it's the most natural thing in the world.\""

  "010146hugekey": {
    "note": " The “huge key\" that locks the strong exterior door of the Martello tower is mentioned eight times in Telemachus, and again in Proteus. Buttressed by references to another key in Bloom's chapters, it becomes emblematic of various kinds of dispossession: homelessness, sexual betrayal, political subjection, metaphysical ignorance.",
    "expandedNote": " The key is indeed huge. Preserved in the Joyce Museum that now inhabits the tower, it dwarfs the printed pamphlet next to it, measuring perhaps nine inches in length. Stephen is keenly aware that Mulligan “wants that key,” and events prove him right: at the swimming hole, Mulligan says, \"Give us that key, Kinch . . . to keep my chemise flat.\" Much later in the book he gives Stephen the slip and goes home to Sandycove without him. At the end of Telemachus Stephen thinks of Mulligan as a “Usurper,\" and in Proteus he thinks, \"He has the key. I will not sleep there when this night comes.\" Giving up the key equates to homelessness for Stephen. \n Less literally, the same is true for Bloom. Exiting his front door in the morning to buy meat, he realizes that he has left the house key in the pants that he wore the day before, and resolves to transfer it to the pockets of his funeral suit when he gets back, before leaving again for the day. He fails to do so, a fact that renders him \"doubly irritated\" in Ithaca, \"because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded himself twice not to forget.\" The chapter then notes that his keylessness allies him with the young man standing next to him: he and Stephen are \"the, premeditatedly (respectively) and inadvertently, keyless couple.\" For Bloom, the lack of a house key can be physically remedied by climbing over a railing, hanging from it by his hands, dropping several feet into the basement \"area,\" and entering through the unlocked kitchen door. But being without a key, just after his wife has cuckolded him, symbolically suggests that he has been evicted from his home, a suggestion sounded quite vividly in Circe when Blazes Boylan invites him to \"apply your eye to the keyhole and play with yourself while I just go through her a few times.\"\n Similar echoes of dispossession sound for the entire country of Ireland when Bloom goes searching for an ad whose visual device, two crossed keys, the merchant Alexander Keyes would like to use in a new ad. The idea, Bloom says to Nannetti in Aeolus, is \"the house of keys. You know, councillor, the Manx parliament. Innuendo of home rule. Tourists, you know, from the isle of Man. Catches the eye, you see. Can you do that?\" The lower chamber of the Isle of Man's parliament is called the House of Keys, and as Gifford observes \"after 1866 its members were chosen by popular election.\" Lacking such a parliament, Ireland is a house without keys, its subject population excluded from full citizenship by British imperial rule. Citing Erskine Childers' The Framework of Home Rule (1911), Slote notes that \"Since the Manx people are of Celtic origin, their relative independence from English control was taken as a possible model for the Home Rule movement in Ireland.\" \n In a still broader sense, keylessness may evoke the state of metaphysical cluelessness that characterizes every human being on the planet. Later in Ithaca, Stephen describes himself to Bloom as \"a conscious rational animal proceeding syllogistically from the known to the unknown and a conscious rational reagent between a micro and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon the incertitude of the void.\" Not quite fathoming his brainy companion's conception of wresting meaning from a universal void, Bloom does understand enough to intuit a clever analogy with his having recently dropped through empty space to get into his house: he comforts himself in his bafflement by reflecting that \"as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from the unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void.\""

  "060029huggermugger": {
    "note": " Among Bloom's peculiar thoughts about how women seem to take delight in laying out men's dead bodies—\"Extraordinary the interest they take in a corpse\"—is the notion that they like to skulk about \"Huggermugger in corners.\" \"Huggermugger\" is an old word (the OED traces it to the early 16th century) meaning secrecy or concealment. It can be noun, adjective, adverb, or verb.",
    "expandedNote": " A very well known use of the word occurs in Hamlet, when Claudius tells Gertrude that \"we have done but greenly / In hugger-mugger to inter\" Polonius (4.5.83-84). Hamlet has killed Polonius and dragged the body offstage to hide it: \"This man shall set me packing; / I'll lug the guts into the neighbor room\" (3.4.211-12). After taunting Claudius with jokes about the old counselor's decomposing body, Hamlet at last tells him where he can find it: \"if indeed you find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go up the stairs into the lobby\" (4.2.35-37). But Claudius, fearing public outcry, maintains the secrecy practiced by the prince, burying Polonius hastily and without public ceremony. \n If Bloom is thinking about the line from Hamlet (we know that he knows the play), perhaps the idea of secretly stashing a body in some odd \"corner\" appeals to his sense of a public conspiracy to conceal the ugly fact of death? Or perhaps the mere sound of the word \"huggermugger,\" like \"slipperslappers\" in the next sentence, appeals to his nursery-rhyme playful irreverence, which is often on display in this chapter."

  "010040hyperborean": {
    "note": " Mulligan says, \"I'm hyperborean as much as you,\" using a word that Friedrich Nietzsche applied to the Übermensch, the superman who will free himself from Christian ethics and transcendental metaphysics. Later in Telemachus, Mulligan playfully declares, “I’m the Uebermensch.\"",
    "expandedNote": " \"Hyperborean\" means literally “beyond the north wind” (the Greeks personified winds from the north as Boreas). Various ancient Greek writers referred to the home of hyperborean peoples as a kind of paradise, a place of perpetual spring, sunshine, and youth. The legend became popular in the nineteenth century and might have reached Joyce through many different sources, but the most likely one is Nietzsche. \n Thornton notes the philosopher's use of the term in The Antichrist (1888, publ. 1895): \"Let us face ourselves. We are Hyperboreans; we know very well how far off we live. 'Neither by land nor by sea will you find the way to the Hyperboreans'—Pindar already knew this about us. Beyond the north, ice, and death—our life, our happiness. We have discovered happiness, we know the way, we have found our way out of the labyrinth of thousands of years.\" Gifford adds that the adjective is used in The Will to Power (1896) to characterize the Übermensch.\n Nietzsche's anti-Christian philosophy is almost certainly the operative context for Mulligan's earlier statement, because he is commenting on Stephen’s refusal to surrender to his mother’s request for a show of Christian piety. The more interesting question is how Mulligan, Stephen, and Joyce understand the German philosopher's ideas. Mulligan seems to find in his writings an inspiration for irresponsible, selfish hedonism. Stephen's thoughts are not made clear. There is good reason to think that Joyce, at least by the time he wrote Ulysses, may have come to a much more penetrating understanding of these writings."

  "170021hypnotic": {
    "note": " After listening to Stephen's anti-Semitic song in Ithaca, Bloom ponders a multitude of conditions capable of producing dangerously aberrant behavior in human beings. The list concludes with \"hypnotic suggestion and somnambulism.\" As subsequent paragraphs explain, he is thinking not of hypnosis in the usual sense but of several different sleep disorders, known collectively as parasomnias, which he and his daughter Milly have experienced. Bloom's hunch about how closely these conditions are related is spot on, but his fear of them (expressed later in the chapter by a reference to \"malignant agencies\") is somewhat exaggerated.",
    "expandedNote": " In his popular book The Body: A Guide for Occupants (Doubleday, 2019), Bill Bryson observes that human parasomnias include \"sleepwalking, confusional arousal (when the victim appears to be awake but is profoundly muddled), nightmares, and night terrors. The last two are not easily distinguished except that night terrors are more intense and tend to leave the victim more shaken, though curiously victims of night terrors very often have no recollection of the experience the following morning. Most parasomnias are much more common in young children than in adults and tend to disappear around puberty, if not before\" (272-73). Bryson omits to mention sleep paralysis, another important member of this class of disorders.\n Ithaca makes clear that the pattern of sleep disturbances afflicting children applies well to Milly, who \"at the ages of 6 and 8 years had uttered in sleep an exclamation of terror and had replied to the interrogations of two figures in night attire with a vacant mute expression.\" Milly seems to have suffered from some confusional arousal after she was aroused from her night terrors. The chapter does not say when Bloom experienced his own sleep disorders, but it identifies them very precisely: \"From hypnotic suggestion: once, waking, he had not recognised his sleeping apartment: more than once, waking, he had been for an indefinite time incapable of moving or uttering sounds. From somnambulism: once, sleeping, his body had risen, crouched and crawled in the direction of a heatless fire and, having attained its destination, there, curled, unheated, in night attire had lain, sleeping.\" \n The first of these three conditions—waking up and for a few moments not knowing where one is—is probably another form of \"confusional arousal.\" It may seem odd to blame these strange, brief states on \"hypnotic suggestion,\" but this is Ithaca and the Greek noun hypnos means simply \"sleep,\" and Hypnos was sometimes seen as a god of sleep. Many purely sleep-producing chemicals (as opposed to ones that induce sleepiness as a side effect) are classed as \"hypnotics,\" including melatonin, the hormone produced in the pineal gland in all diurnal mammals. Buried within the capacity to fall asleep, however, are some of the strange hybrid states of unconscious consciousness more commonly evoked by the word \"hypnosis.\" Insomnia medications like Ambien (zolpidem), which is notorious for causing sleepers to do things of which they later have no memory (online binge shopping, driving vehicles, having sex) are also classed as hypnotics. \n The second of Bloom's conditions, being \"for an indefinite time incapable of moving or uttering sounds,\" is commonly known as sleep paralysis. It usually occurs while falling asleep or beginning to wake up. Victims are fully conscious and aware of their surroundings, but they cannot move or speak. The condition is thought usually to last no more than a couple of minutes, but it can seem longer because the bodily paralysis, sometimes accompanied by auditory hallucinations and feelings of pressure on the chest, can induce panic and even terror. For many centuries people attributed these experiences to incubi, succubi, witches, demons, jinns, and other malignant beings. Henry Fuseli's famous painting The Nightmare, which shows an incubus sitting on a woman's chest, is often supposed to represent the condition of sleep paralysis.\n Sleepwalking, or \"somnambulism,\" is a condition in which people get up and move around while still asleep. Joyce's prose reflects that state of near-unconsciousness: it is not Bloom himself, but \"his body,\" that moved to the fireplace. The general public is more aware of sleepwalking than the other disorders discussed here, but all of them are quite common, all of them seem to be intimately related, and, as Bryson notes, most if not all of them occur more frequently in childhood than adult life. Bloom's scientific instincts are quite sound when he assumes that Milly's night terrors are a \"cognate phenomenon\" with his own sleepwalking. \n These strange, and frequently alarming, features of the human ability to hover between consciousness and unconsciousness clearly have given Bloom some empathetic identification with his young daughter. They also have given him some apprehension about falling asleep. Later in Ithaca, after discussing Bloom's strategies for getting a good night's sleep, and noting that \"he believed in the artificial placation of malignant agencies chiefly operative during somnolence,\" the narrator asks, \"What did he fear?\" The answer: \"The committal of homicide or suicide during sleep by an aberration of the light of reason.\" The mortal fear experienced in sleep paralysis and night terrors has made Bloom wonder what kinds of dark forces may lurk just beneath the surface of normal consciousness."

    "expandedNote": " Although Stephen leaves the tower at the end of this episode less dramatically than Telemachus or Joyce (he heads off to a morning of teaching at Mr. Deasy’s private boys’ school), he resolves not to return at night. He avoids a planned meeting with Mulligan and Haines at The Ship—a narrative echo of Telemachus’ evasion of the ambush at sea planned by Antinous and his companions.

    "note": " \"God, we'll simply have to dress the character. I want puce gloves and green boots. Do I contradict myself? Very well then, I contradict myself.\" Mulligan's perpetual spray of quotations from his favorite writers (Swinburne, Russell, Homer, Xenophon, Nietzsche, Yeats, Wilde) continues as he rummages through his clothing trunk, applying Walt Whitman's famous declaration of personal immensity to the superficial business of accessorizing a yellow waistcoat with green boots and dark red gloves.",
    "expandedNote": " In Song of Myself, Whitman wrote:\n Do I contradict myself?\n Very well then I contradict myself,\n (I am large, I contain multitudes.)\n Gifford notes the relevant fact that Whitman’s reputation was high in England at the end of the nineteenth century, citing “Swinburne’s praise of him as the poet of the ‘earth-god freedom’ in To Walt Whitman in America (1871).” Mulligan's determination to dress in the outrageous fashion of the fin de siècle avant-garde (\"we'll simply have to dress the character\") coheres, then, with the quotation that accessorizes the accessories.\n Stephen thinks of these lines in Proteus, and in Scylla and Charybdis he too mentions Whitman in the course of his Shakespeare talk."
  },
  "090002iiandi": {
    "note": " \"I, I, and I. I.\" As Stephen begins to explain to the Dubliners the ways in which Shakespeare’s identity resides within the characters he created, his mind wanders into thoughts of his own life and the metamorphosis of the self from day to day. Gifford points out this passage’s economical incorporation of both the discontinuity and continuity of identity—three distinguishable I’s and a single unified I.",
    "expandedNote": " We are primed for this tension in the preceding lines. Though Joyce’s use of the triple “I” could be abstracted to represent any number of trinity-related concepts, his contextual emphasis on particular identity suggests the triple-self of consciousness: the past (memory), present (experience), and future (anticipation). “Molecules all change,” Stephen thinks. “I am other I now.” And yet identity somehow remains stable thanks to memory’s continuity, as he thinks two lines later: “But I, entelechy, form of forms, am I by memory because under everchanging forms.” \n Gifford notes that the Aristotelian term entelechy signifies the actuality of particular existence with the “power to produce other actualities of the same kind” (206). Stephen thinks of two earlier actualities: \"I that sinned and prayed and fasted\" (the fornicating and repenting adolescent represented in chapters 2, 3, and 4 of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man), and \"A child Conmee saved from pandies\" (the six-year-old boy represented in chapter 1). \n Identity is central to any book where the author is writing about himself, but Joyce plays in particularly daring ways with its continuities and discontinuities. In Circe, the character of the fan speaks to Stephen: “Is me her was you dreamed before? Was then she him you us since knew? Am all them and the same now we?” This syntax imposes transitive properties on otherwise separate identities. The comparison can be made to a mechanical fan, an object of nearly identical yet ontologically distinct blades that expand through space and time to produce their own overarching unity."

  "030090knowthevoice": {
    "note": " Early in Proteus, Stephen reflects on having been sired by \"the man with my voice and my eyes.\" The thought anticipates a recollection, later in the chapter, of Kevin Egan saying to him, \"You're your father's son. I know the voice.\" Egan's remark makes him symbolically a Nestor, like Deasy.",
    "expandedNote": " In the Odyssey, old Nestor remarks on young Telemachus' resemblance to Odysseus: \"Your father? / Well, I must say I marvel at the sight of you: / your manner of speech couldn't be more like his; / one would say No; no boy could speak so well\" (Fitzgerald 3.130-33). In Book 4, Menelaus and Helen also remark on how much Telemachus looks like Odysseus.\n Stephen's relationship with Egan seems more congenial than the one with his employer, but he interprets Egan's Nestor-like comment as an effort to coopt Stephen to his revolutionary cause: \"To yoke me as his yokefellow, our crimes our common cause. You're your father's son. I know the voice.\" As with Mulligan and Deasy, Stephen wants no part of such paternalistic guidance."

    "note": " \"I was just passing the time of day with old Troy\": \"I\"? In a novel that has been built on third-person narration—despite the intrusion of newspaper-like headlines inAeolus, brief dramatic scripts in Scylla and Charybdis, space-time juxtapositions in Wandering Rocks, and quasi-musical word-constructs in Sirens—the twelfth episode announces at its outset that the narrative rules are about to change radically. This episode will be narrated first-person by a man who, it soon appears, is a down-on-his-luck, mean-spirited, misanthropic barhound. The speaker is never named, and he does not appear or figure in any other chapter of Ulysses.",
    "expandedNote": " By some measures, the twelfth chapter's \"I\" shows the novel crossing a Rubicon. In The Odyssey of Style in Ulysses (Princeton, 1981), Karen Lawrence notes that the previous chapter seems to push what Joyce called the \"initial style\" of his book (objective third-person narration infused with interior monologue and free indirect discourse) to the brink of destruction: \"The third-person narration in the early chapters seems to have outlived its usefulness, and, indeed, it disappears after the Sirens chapter,\" albeit, she notes, with a brief reappearance in Nausicaa (98). The novel abandons first-person narration too after Cyclops, though the last chapter, Penelope, once again makes an \"I\" central.\n Given the defamiliarizing strangeness of the previous chapter, Lawrence observes, \"the sudden appearance of this [new] person is, for the most part, reassuring. No matter how 'limited' a point of view he represents, the presence of a definitive narrative self is comforting. Despite the inevitable questions about the reliability and temporality of his narrative, which do provide some discomfiture, the narrator provides relief after the fragmentation of Sirens. For the first time in Ulysses we encounter an actual narrative persona\" (101). But the relief of being able to anchor upon some firm ground of subjectivity soon dissipates, as parodic voices intrude upon the narrator's story."

  "160006icebergs": {
    "note": " In Eumaeus, a chapter filled with allusions to shipwrecks, frequent mentions of ice are perhaps the first clue that Joyce may be evoking the sinking of a famous Irish vessel in April 1912. A reference, about halfway through the chapter, to \"collisions with icebergs\" certainly strengthens this hypothesis.",
    "expandedNote": " Although no one in 1904 could have known of the wreck of theTitanic—that imposing product of the Belfast shipyards had not yet been built—Senan Molony argues, in an unpublished paper presented to the summer 2019 Trieste Joyce School, that echoes of the disaster permeate the 16th chapter of Ulysses. Joyce sprinkles these echoes into his text lightly, Molony observes: \"he is too fine and disciplined a writer to spoil the subtlety of his craft with a heavy hand. Therefore the Titanic influences are not so ill-mannered as to be explicit, but are instead part of Joyce's mood-tonality, his artistic pointillism, which builds up the form and shape of the overall from hundreds, or even thousands, of pieces of verbal mosaic.\"\n As Stephen and Bloom approach the cabman's shelter early in the chapter, \"Adjacent to the men's public urinal they perceived an icecream car round which a group of presumably Italians in heated altercation were getting rid of voluble expressions.\" In Irish cities low-class eateries and street food vendors often begin business at the end of the work day and stay open into the wee hours, so encountering such a cart after midnight would not by itself be unusual. But an ice cream cart, on a day whose morning began quite chilly and which has seen a torrential rainstorm in the late evening? Perhaps so, but the detail seems at least mildly surprising. Less than half a page later, the two men have stepped into the shelter and Bloom suggests, \"to break the ice,\" that Stephen might want to consider having a bite to eat. The expression is perfectly commonplace, but ice has now twice been insinuated into a reader's sensorium.\n When Skipper Murphy begins to command the conversation, he steers the imagery in a nautical direction: \"I seen icebergs plenty, growlers.\" Growlers are very small bergs which get their name from the animal-like sounds they can emit as their ice melts. Since they project no more than a meter or two above the surface of the water, they are easy for lookouts to miss, especially at night or in foggy conditions, and many experienced seamen have speculated that the Titanic must have struck one of these small bergs. Traveling at considerable speed, as the big liner apparently was, hitting the more massive slab of ice that lay underneath such a berg (seven eighths of the total mass) would have been like hitting a large jagged rock below the waterline. Interestingly, the people in Eumaeus have much to say about rocks sticking out of the water. Bloom asks Murphy if he has \"seen the rock of Gibraltar.\" Pressed for details, the old salt growls, \"I'm tired of all them rocks in the sea.\" The keeper of the shelter wants to know \"why that ship ran bang against the only rock in Galway bay when the Galway harbour scheme was mooted by a Mr Worthington.\"\n The unobtrusive iceberg theme rises unmistakably above the surface of the text when the people in the shelter begin talking about maritime accidents: \"Interest, however, was starting to flag somewhat all round and the others got on to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog, collisions with icebergs, all that sort of thing.\" But Molony also notes much more subtle appearances. When Murphy displays his animated tattoo of his companion Antonio, he remarks that he died at sea: \"Ay, ay, sighed the sailor, looking down on his manly chest. He's gone too. Ate by sharks after. Ay, ay.\" \"Eaten alive?\" someone asks. \"Ay, ay, sighed again the latter personage, more cheerily this time.\" Read aloud, \"Ay sighed\" may subliminally suggest the Ice Side that ate theTitanic alive. \n Near the chapter's end, as Bloom leads Stephen through the city streets, the narrative notes that he \"was keeping a sharp lookout as usual,\" and he jokes to his companion, \"Our lives are in peril tonight.\" Molony observes that the men posted on the Titanic's masts were ordered to \"keep a sharp lookout for small ice.\" Several sentences later, Bloom expresses regret that he does not have anything to feed the street-sweeper's horse, as he has fed gulls and a dog earlier in the day: \"such a good poor brute, he was sorry he hadn't a lump of sugar but, as he wisely reflected, you could scarcely be prepared for every emergency that might crop up.\" Holding a lump of sugar up to a horse bears a clear visual resemblance to a small block of ice approaching a large ship, and describing it as an \"emergency\" that might \"crop up\" fits very neatly with the theme.\n Molony's reading of Eumaeus addresses many other details, including the characterizations of Murphy and of the street-sweeping horse at the end of the chapter."

  "010067hartley": {
    "note": " Mulligan's artful dodge when Stephen asks him whether he remembers Stephen visiting him soon after his mother died—\"I remember only ideas and sensations\"—appears to draw on 18th century empiricist philosophy, which posited sensory origins of all human knowledge. If so, then Mulligan is suggesting that life is a flurry of changing sense perceptions and of the concepts uncertainly inferred from them, with no firm grasp of objects or events. In such a phenomenological storm, how could he be expected to remember, much less be responsible for, a friend's mother's death, a social encounter, a hurtful utterance?",
    "expandedNote": " Thornton hears in Mulligan's sentence the influence of John Locke. In book 4, chapter 11 of An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, titled \"Knowledge of the existence of other things,\" Locke argues, \"We can know of the existence of other things only by sensation. No idea you have in your mind has any necessary connection with any real existence. . . Merely having the idea of a thing in your mind no more proves its existence than the picture of a man is evidence of his existence in the world, or than the visions of a dream make a true history.\" \n Locke's skepticism is not thoroughgoing. He believes that we can be certain of our own existence, and of God's, and he is persuaded that we can obtain useful knowledge of a world external to our own minds. But he argues that every idea we have about things outside us, including other human beings, is drawn from sensations. These may well correspond to something actual, but they do not do so necessarily or exactly. \n Some 18th century philosophers drew from Locke's empiricist epistemology the conclusion that reliable understanding of the external world is impossible, since one knows only one’s remembered \"ideas\" of subjective \"sensations.\" Among the entities effaced by such subjective skepticism are other subjects, and Mulligan is happy to use a theoretical explanation of such effacement as an excuse for self-centered hedonism. He conveniently omits to mention any moral sensations that might have formed in his consciousness as a result of speaking so callously about his friend. \n Stephen too, in his very different way, shows interest in the epistemological and ontological implications of Locke's analysis. In Proteus he thinks thoughts inspired by the Irish philosopher George Berkeley, to the effect that perhaps no material world exists outside his own mind. Berkeley's radical idealism stands conspicuously opposed to the materialist philosophies of most of Locke's followers, but it too stems from the disjunction between sensations and objects that Locke effected. Walking along the beach, Stephen regards his sensory perceptions not as partially reliable impressions of material objects but as \"coloured signs\" which can be read like text to reveal an invisible, spiritual order of being. \n The presence of Bishop Berkeley in Ulysses suggests that it is quite possible that Mulligan has derived his view of Lockean \"ideas and sensations\" from some intermediary source. Gifford hears in the words “the essentially mechanistic concept of the human psyche developed by the English philosopher David Hartley (1705-57)” under Locke's influence. The Scottish philosopher David Hume's investigations were also shaped by the great English forebear."

  "040050ikeymo": {
    "note": " When 1904 Dubliners want to express ethnic contempt for Jews, one choice term of opprobrium seems to be \"jewy.\" Others are the familiar \"sheeny\" and the literary \"Barabbas.\" A term of less obvious significance, \"Ikey,\" expresses a milder strain of anti-Semitic feeling. It came from an English comic strip.",
    "expandedNote": " The narrator of Cyclops imparts visceral ugliness to \"jewy\" when he says, \"Jesus, I had to laugh at the little jewy getting his shirt out,\" and \"I'm told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them.\" Buck Mulligan's description of Bloom as \"The sheeny!\" in Scylla and Charybdis is not much better, and Stephen's willingness to incorporate such language into his Shakespeare talk shortly afterward—\"Shylock chimes with the jewbaiting that followed the hanging and quartering of the queen's leech Lopez, his jew's heart being plucked forth whilethe sheeny was yet alive\"—is one measure of just how indiscriminately he gathers material for his thesis and how eagerly he seeks to be included in the Dublin literary community.\n Mulligan follows this slur with another: \"He jumped up and snatched the card. / —What's his name? Ikey Moses? Bloom.\" This phrase, which is heard again in Circe as \"Ikey Mo,\" combines the names Isaac and Moses. It may have originated with, and at a minimum was popularized by, the Ally Sloper cartoon series that began running in Judy magazine (the counterpart to Punch) in August 1867, and later in its own magazine called Ally Sloper's Half Holiday. The name of Ally Sloper, the main character, derived from the fact that he was often to be seen sloping off up some alley to avoid a landlord or creditor. He was the first recurring comic strip character, and inspired a host of imitators from Charlie Chaplin's tramp to W. C. Fields' lush. Later in Circe a \"hobgoblin in the image of Punch Costello\" is given an \"Ally Sloper nose.\"\n Ally's Jewish pal Ikey Mo was similarly disreputable, drawing on ancient stereotypes of Jews as money-grubbing. Gifford notes that he \"is portrayed as an unctuous pickpocket and small-time con man; he even picks his hostess's pocket during a Christmas party.\" Despite the derogatory nature of the representation, these two characters, Gentile and Jew, were presented on an equal footing, and their occasionally successful scheming invited affection as much as disdain. It seems that \"Ikey\" could, as Gifford notes, mean not only \"Jew or Jewish,\" but also \"smart, alert, artful, clever.\" Bloom uses it in this sense in Calypso when he admires Arthur Griffith's witty remark: \"He prolonged his pleased smile. Ikey touch that: homerule sun rising up in the northwest.\"\n But \"Ikey Moses\" certainly did carry strains of anti-Semitic contempt. Versions of an Irish and Scottish music hall song sometimes called My Old Cloth Shop present a tailor of that name who is eagerly concerned with making money, sometimes against the wishes of the Gentile customers who would like to take their new clothes without paying the dirty Jew who made them. \n Alan Collins, the Australian Jewish author of Alva's Boy: An Unsentimental Memoir (2009), records that he would often join in his gentile companions' singing of another song that used the name, simply because he liked the tune: \n Ikey Moses King of the Jews\n Sold his wife for a pair of shoes, \n When the shoes began to wear\n Ikey Moses began to swear. (159)\n A version of this song appears in Circe:\n Moses, Moses, king of the jews,\n Wiped his arse in the Daily News.\n Racial hatred is despicable, but today's climate of ultra-solemn multi-cultural political correctness can make it impossible to appreciate the not-always-hateful vitality of late 19th and early 20th century cities lit up by the antagonisms, stereotypes, and mocking jokes of rival ethnic communities. \"Ikey Moses\" seems to fall more in the category of insensitive ribbing than in the realm of violent bigotry occupied by men who say that jewies have a queer odor coming off them."

  "010027hero": {
    "note": " In its immediate narrative context in Telemachus, “I’m not a hero” refers to Stephen’s morbid fear of water and to his nonaggressiveness more generally. But it also constitutes a pointed reference to his original fictional name. When Joyce stayed with Gogarty in the tower he was working on a book called Stephen Hero, a long and eternally unfinished autobiographical novel whose materials Joyce eventually reworked into A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. The title does not imply straightforward glorification of the protagonist. Ellmann speculates that when Joyce sought a new one, it was “because he felt the first title might imply a more sardonic view of his hero than he intended” (193).",
    "expandedNote": " As he changed Stephen Hero into the Stephen Dedalus of A Portrait and then the Stephen Dedalus of Ulysses, he nevertheless subjected him to harsher and harsher treatment. At the end of the first chapter of A Portrait, Stephen is hailed as a hero by the other boys at Clongowes Wood College, and carried in triumph like a Roman conqueror, because he went to the rector to protest an unjust beating at the hands of a priest whom the boys all fear. But he learns later that the incident was a source of amusement to the rector. After that point he cannot take leadership seriously, even when other boys look up to him or when the priests admire his piety. In Ulysses, the question about Stephen seems to be not whether or not he is a hero, but whether or not he is a total failure. \n In a letter written to his brother Stanislaus from Pola in 1905, when he was still busily working on Stephen Hero, Joyce declared, “I am sure however that the whole structure of heroism is, and always was, a damned lie” (Ellmann, 192). He did not change this opinion. The hero of Ulysses is Leopold Bloom rather than Stephen Dedalus, but Bloom is decidedly an anti-hero by the standards of ancient Greek epic. Heroism of the type exemplified by athletes and warriors is subjected to ironic scrutiny throughout the book, and made utterly ridiculous in Cyclops."

  "070008intheheart": {
    "note": " The 7th episode, usually called Aeolus, parodies the format of a newspaper, with block headlines introducing short, punchy chunks of text. Since its \"art\" is rhetoric, it is also filled to the brim with figures of speech: formulaic patternings of words that capture attention and stir response. Of the hundreds of such figures that were identified by theorists of rhetoric in antiquity, metaphor is easily the most familiar, so it is fitting that Aeolus begins with one: \"IN THE HEART\" of a big city. This is precisely the kind of stale metaphor that modern men and women expect to encounter in newspaper headlines, but Joyce will breathe new life into the tiresome cliché before long.",
    "expandedNote": " In his \"Rhetorical Figures in Aeolus,\" an appendix to Gifford's Ulysses Annotated, Robert Seidman offers an encyclopedic list of figures of speech, tagged by ancient rhetoricians with Greek (and occasionally Latin) names, that appear in the novel's newspaper episode. Metaphor, from Greek meta = over, across + pherein = to carry, has become a staple of the English language, but most others sound very foreign.\n Seidman introduces his list by observing that \"The 'art' of the Aeolus episode is rhetoric, the form of linguistic manipulation Joyce considered closest to the heart of the working press. In its concentration on this self-conscious way of organizing language, Aeolus is the precursor of the more complicated use of imitation and parody in Cyclops (Episode 12) and Oxen of the Sun (Episode 14). The earlier manuscript drafts of Aeolus in The Little Review suggest that Joyce added a great number of rhetorical figures in his revisions, deliberately larding the chapter with as many devices as possible. What remains continually impressive is not simply the presence of practically every rhetorical figure outlined by Quintilian and the classical rhetoricians, but the manner in which these contrivances are fitted into the chapter.\"\n Seidman goes on to note the limitations of any such analysis. Many more examples of classical rhetorical figures might be identified in the chapter, and one particular arrangement of words on the page might be construed as an example of several different descriptive categories. The \"insufficiency, overlap, and reduplication of categories,\" he observes, derives from the fact that the theoretical terms evolved to describe ancient oratorical practice, not the other way around. Even among the ancient rhetoricians \"there was considerable uncertainty and much hairsplitting/headsplitting debate.\" \n Stuart Gilbert was the first to comment (in James Joyce's Ulysses, 1930) on the abundance of rhetorical figures in this chapter, no doubt alerted to them by Joyce himself. Gilbert notes the resemblance to William Shakespeare, whose works employ many hundreds of rhetorical figures of speech. In Shakespeare's case, the reasons for writing in this way are very apparent. Since rhetoric was one of the three arts comprising the medieval trivium, and was regarded as particularly useful in the conduct of everyday life, the humanist educators of early modern grammar schools instructed boys in the use of such figures, and adult writers like George Puttenham and John Lyly made careers out of them. Where Joyce might have learned them is somewhat less clear, but the Jesuit ideal of a Christian Eloquentia Perfecta sprang from Renaissance humanist roots and was taught in Jesuit schools from the Renaissance through Joyce's time, so it seems likely that he gained his introduction to rhetorical tropes in the same way, and at much the same age, as Shakespeare did—i.e., in the Jesuit boys' school called Clongowes Wood College.\n Quintilian's twelve-volume Institutes of Oratory (the complete text of which was recovered in 1416, spurring intense humanist study) is available in several English translations, including an important one completed by the Rev. John Selby Watson in 1856. A complete hypertext of Selby's translation, edited by Lee Honeycutt, can be found at http://rhetoric.eserver.org/quintilian.\n My notes for the rhetorical figures in Aeolus will take their lead from Seidman, but diverge from him at many points. It should also be noted that many, many more passages in Joyce's chapter could be cited as examples of particular figures than appear in Seidman's list or my hyperlinks. For example, he does not cite \"IN THE HEART OF THE HIBERNIAN METROPOLIS\" as an example of metaphor, and I do not gloss it as an example of alliteration."

  "080028multiply": {
    "note": " God's command to \"Be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it\" (Genesis 1:28), which the Catholic church interprets in a remarkably literal and prescriptive way, echoes throughout Ulysses. Bloom has no use for the sexual totalitarianism. In Lestrygonians he observes that its enforcers do not have to live with the consequences: \"That’s in their theology or the priest won’t give the poor woman the confession, the absolution. Increase and multiply. Did you ever hear such an idea? Eat you out of house and home. No families themselves to feed.\" Still, he feels the power of the call to reproduce, and in Oxen of the Sun Joyce harps on the theme, suggesting that his male protagonists have some work to do in the bedroom.",
    "expandedNote": " In Proteus Stephen thinks of his parents having performed \"the coupler's will.\" Gifford reasons that God is the \"coupler\" because He joins men and women in the sacrament of marriage, and it is His \"will\" that human beings procreate. In a personal communication, Senan Molony argues that the coupler, which Joyce does not capitalize, should instead be seen as the priest who married Stephen's parents, because he is the one who actually gave them the charge. And, as Bloom observes, it is also the priest who enforces the ban on practicing birth control. But Stephen is thinking of God just before and just after he speaks of the coupler, and other passages in the novel suggest that the Almighty has not entirely delegated this particular \"will\" to his vicars on earth. In Nausicaa Bloom recalls the Irish expression, \"As God made them he matched them,\" which suggests that couplings may be effected at a higher pay grade. \n The distinction is a fine one not worth much argument, but the question of how the church's teaching may apply to Stephen and to Bloom is more interesting. Bloom thinks of the doctrine in Lestrygonians when he sees Simon Dedalus' half-starving daughter on the street. With only slight exaggeration of Joyce's family background he reflects, \"Fifteen children he had. Birth every year almost.\" It seems unlikely that the apostate Stephen will ever practice such murine reproduction (Joyce himself had only two children), but clearly he wants to find a mate, and clearly he is not doing much to make it happen. In Oxen of the Sun, which plays relentlessly with the idea that fecundation is a divinely ordained imperative, Bloom grieves \"for young Stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and murdered his goods with whores.\" \n But the chapter subjects Bloom to similar criticism. Another of its sections condemns him as \"his own and only enjoyer,\" a husband whose field \"lies fallow for the want of a ploughshare.\" Having produced only one child who survived to reproductive age, and having neglected his marital duty since the trauma of losing his infant son, thereby making it impossible to heal the breach with another child, is Bloom failing, if not the church's command to subdue the earth with children, then at least his biological imperative to perpetuate his lineage? In Ithaca he thinks, no, he has raised one child and therefore is not obligated to make any others: \"The parties concerned, uniting, had increased and multiplied, which being done, offspring produced and educed to maturity, the parties, if not disunited were obliged to reunite for increase and multiplication, which was absurd.\" Having sex with Molly after she has taken a lover seems all the more undesirable, and absurd to boot, since the purpose of sex is to create children, and that phase of his life is over.\n But repetitions of the word \"multiply\" hint at the sad sterility of the marriage. In Calypso Bloom thinks of the Jewish people \"multiplying, dying, being born everywhere,\" and then of the Dead Sea, \"an old woman's: the grey sunken cunt of the world.\" Later in Lestrygonians he dreams of governments giving every child a financial start in life: \"give every child born five quid at compound interest up to twentyone five per cent is a hundred shillings and five tiresome pounds multiply by twenty decimal system encourage people to put by money save hundred and ten and a bit twentyone years want to work it out on paper come to a tidy sum more than you think. / Not stillborn of course. They are not even registered. Trouble for nothing.\" In Oxen of the Sun Mulligan lewdly proposes a fertilizing farm to remedy the childlessness of women with no mates, or poor ones, and thereby to \"multiply the inlets of happiness.\" \n This chapter's evocations of a God who insists on procreation and is angry when his will is thwarted echo the Homeric god who is angered by the slaughter of his cattle. It seems impossible that Joyce meant to affirm the Catholic church's rules for sexual behavior, but on the other hand it is quite possible that he is affirming the deep human drive couched in the biblical injunction. Considering the importance placed on children in Joyce's novel, readers may well assent to the assertion, in Oxen's first long paragraph, that \"no nature's boon can contend against the bounty of increase.\""

  "030034ineluctable": {
    "note": " \"Ineluctable modality of the visible: at least that if no more, thought through my eyes\": at the beginning of Proteus Stephen is thinking about sight, and continuing the balancing act between prophetic vision andAristotelian empiricism that occupied him at the beginning of Nestor. Trying a thought experiment to see if he can access ultimate reality by transcending sensory appearances, he decides that he cannot, and spends the rest of the chapter looking around him.",
    "expandedNote": " \"Ineluctable\" means simply unavoidable or inevitable, but its etymology is interesting: the Latin eluctari means to struggle out of. The word's root meaning implies, then, that Stephen is struggling to escape from the \"modality of the visible.\" And indeed, at the end of the first paragraph he thinks, \"Shut your eyes and see.\" He wishes that there might be an alternative to physical sight, some mode of spiritual vision that he could access by blacking out the input of the senses. Near the end of the next paragraph, walking along the sand with his eyes closed tight, he thinks, \"Am I walking into eternity along Sandymount strand?\" \n The answer to his question will be No, but he already has the answer before conducting his bizarre experiment: he knows that physical vision is \"ineluctable.\" Stephen's struggle to overcome sight recalls his struggle to overcome the bitter facts of history at the beginning of Nestor, where he decided that \"they are not to be thought away.\" And it anticipates Shakespeare's struggle (in Scylla and Charybdis) to overcome the disastrous facts of his sexual life, which similarly could only be thought about, not thought away.\n In the case of physical sight, the text suggests that ineluctability may not be a bad thing. The phrase that follows, \"at least that if no more,\" implies that sight is something to start with. Like Descartes who doubted the existence of everything in his experience until he found one solid foundation on which to build his philosophy, Stephen at least has sight, \"thought through my eyes,\" on which to center his existence. \n Thornton suggests that \"Ineluctable modality of the visible\" may have been inspired by Aristotle's De Anima, but acknowledges that \"nowhere have I found this exact phrase.\" Gifford too fails to find an exact Aristotelian analogue, but Stephen does think often of Aristotle in the remainder of the paragraph. Against the Greek philosopher's empiricist understanding of sight, he is soon advancing idealist understandings inspired by his reading of Jakob Boehme and George Berkeley. The thought that comes through the eyes, according to these conceptions, is not knowledge of physical objects and processes, but spiritual insight. But Aristotelian materialism seems to have the last word. When Stephen opens his eyes to find that he has not succeeded in blinking the world away, he thinks, \"See now. There all the time without you: and ever shall be, world without end.\" The concluding phrase echoes Aristotle's understanding of matter, which Joyce associated with Proteus. \n Stephen struggles to reconcile Aristotelian empiricism with his cherished models of spiritual idealism, but he always holds fast to the former as the ineluctable basis for understanding reality. In Scylla and Charybdis, thinking once more of Aristotle as a guide to understanding the prodigious reality of William Shakespeare's corpus, he resolves to \"Hold to the now, the here, through which all future plunges to the past.\""

  "020008infinitepossibilities": {
    "note": " Moving on from Blake in Nestor, Stephen thinks of a different model for understanding history, with a different way of relating intellectual possibilities to tyrannically stubborn facts. Aristotle's Metaphysics describes coming-into-being as passage from a state of potentiality (dynamis) to a state of actuality (energeia). Stephen rather loosely reads this argument as implying that, in any moment, there are \"infinite possibilities\" that might become actual. Only one possibility does become actual, so the others are \"ousted.\"",
    "expandedNote": " In the next two sentences, he checks himself. Perhaps other possibilities are not infinite; perhaps, in fact, \"only\" that which becomes actual ever was possible. This line of thought seems closer to what Aristotle says in the Metaphysics, but it is even more discouraging than thinking of unpleasant actualities \"ousting\" better ones. It would make history one long deterministic process of unrolling a script that has already been (all but) written. \n After an unfortunate interruption caused by the need to speak with his pupils (Stephen is not much of a teacher), he returns to his silent Aristotelian interrogation of history: \"It must be a movement, then, an actuality of the possible as possible.\" The allusion here, Thornton observes, is to Aristotle's Physics 201a10: \"The fulfillment [completion or actuality, entelecheia, a near-synonym of energeia] of what exists potentially [dynamis], in so far as it exists potentially, is motion [kinesis].\" Similar statements, Thornton notes, can be found at Physics 202a7 and 251a9, andMetaphysics 1065b20 ff.\n In Oxen of the Sun Stephen applies this Aristotelian logic to the question of contraception, which the Catholic church forbids: \"what of those Godpossibled souls that we nightly impossibilise, which is the sin against the Holy Ghost, Very God, Lord and Giver of Life?\""
  },
  "030068ingemiscit": {
    "note": " Stephen thinks, of the sea, \"diebus ac noctibus iniurias patiens ingemiscit\": \"by days and nights it patiently groans over wrongs.\" He is recalling Saint Ambrose's commentary on Romans 8:22, which reads: \"For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain until now.\" In many translations of Paul's words, the creation suffers the pains of childbirth, waiting for the manifestation of God the way a pregnant woman waits for delivery. Stephen seems to be aware of this conflation of metaphysical expectation with sexual generation.",
    "expandedNote": " Watching seaweed moving on the incoming tide, Stephen thinks of women. He sees \"the writhing weeds lift languidly and sway reluctant arms, hising up their petticoats, in whispering water swaying and upturning coy silver fronds. Day by day: night by night: lifted, flooded and let fall. Lord, they are weary; and, whispered to, they sigh.\" This picture of weary women lifting up their skirts for \"lascivious men\" seems to trigger his memory of the Pauline image: \"Saint Ambrose heard it, sigh of leaves and waves, waiting, awaiting the fullness of their times, diebus ac noctibus iniurias patiens ingemiscit.\" But instead of, or in addition to, Paul's thought that the whole Creation longs for delivery from sin and revelation of the Creator, Stephen meditates on a specifically sexual weariness. \n Drawing on the knowledge of Father W. T. Noon, Thornton notes that the Latin phrase comes from Ambrose's Commentary on Romans. Ambrose (ca. 340-397) was an early church bishop who became known as one of the four Doctors or Fathers of the western church. Born in Germany and educated in Rome, he became bishop of Milan in 374 by popular acclamation, in the midst of an intense fray between Arians and adherents of the Nicene Creed. He defended the orthodox position even against the Emperor Valentinian II, an Arian. His passionate Trinitarianism may have recommended him to Joyce."

Or a lilt. Ahbeesee defeegee kelomen opeecue rustyouvee doubleyou.\") His lilting list records the names of three small islands (inis means island in Irish) off the coasts of County Mayo and County Galway.",
    "expandedNote": " Ireland's western islands are sparsely inhabited and remote from urban civilization. Although the ones Bloom names all had inhabitants in Joyce's time (Inishark has since been abandoned), the only access would have been by fishing boat. Like the Aran Islands a bit further south (Inishmore, Inishmaan, and Inisheer), which Joyce visited in 1912 and whose Gaelic-inflected idiom Synge imitated in his plays, they would have figured in the national imagination as bastions of ruggedly authentic Irishness—hence perhaps their inclusion in the curriculum.\n Gifford notes that the three islands lie near a part of Galway and Mayo called the Joyce Country, so there may be some overdetermination in their selection. As if to respond to his creator's pride in his family name, Bloom goes on to think of a range of mountains that bears his own surname: \"Mine. Slieve Bloom.\""

  "020056nutshell": {
    "note": " Joyce makes sly comedy out of the longwinded letter, which takes its dilatory, desultory time to get to the point. \"I have put the matter into a nutshell,\" Deasy says, but Stephen has to wade through a paragraph or two of unrelated concerns before reading, \"To come to the point at issue.\" After such an opening, Deasy's pride in his epistolary economy is quite funny: \"— I don't mince words, do I? Mr Deasy asked as Stephen read on.\" The word \"nutshell\" makes it tempting to hear an allusion to Shakespeare's Polonius in this passage.",
    "expandedNote": " In Hamlet 2.2 the prince says, \"O God, I could be bounded in a nut shell and count myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.\" Earlier in the same scene, Shakespeare makes comedy much like Joyce's out of the desire of Claudius and Gertrude to learn what Polonius has discovered, a desire frustrated by the old man's euphuistic wordsmithing: \"\"to expostulate / What majesty should be, what duty is, / Why day is day, night night, and time is time, / Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time . . . Your noble son is mad: / Mad call I it, for to define true madness, / What is't but to be nothing else but mad? . . . That he's mad, 'tis true, 'tis true 'tis pity, / And pity 'tis tis true . . .\" (2.2.86-98). In the midst of all this verbiage, Gertrude mutters, \"More matter with less art.\" Polonius objects, \"Madam, I swear I use no art at all,\" and then proceeds to use still more. In this context his often-quoted line, \"Brevity is the soul of wit\" (2.2.90), has the same effect as Deasy's \"I don't mince words, do I?\"\n After his earlier quotation of Shakespeare, it is tempting to view old Deasy here as a reincarnation of Polonius, the old counselor who thinks he has discovered the cause of Hamlet's madness but requires two hundred words to \"come to the point at issue.\""

This Homeric analogue recurs several times within the cavelike confines of Barney Kiernan's.",
    "expandedNote": " Pressed to drink with the men in the pub, the abstemious Bloom resists, \"saying he wouldn't and he couldn't and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well he'd just take a cigar.\" The narrator later refers to this lit log in Bloom's hands as a \"knockmedown cigar,\" and when Bloom courageously asserts that his Jewish people have been just as badly persecuted as the Irish have, the image of a stick in the eye seems always to be hovering nearby. The narrator paints a picture of \"J. J. and the citizen arguing about law and history with Bloom sticking in an odd word,\" and then he quotes one of Bloom's interjections: \"— Some people, says Bloom, can see the mote in others' eyes but they can't see the beam in their own.\" \n The Citizen, playing the part of Polyphemus in this exchange, does indeed fail to see the beam that has been thrust into his eye: \"— Raimeis, says the citizen. There's no-one as blind as the fellow that won't see, if you know what that means. Where are our missing twenty millions of Irish should be here today instead of four, our lost tribes?\" Bloom's thrust was too subtle for a shaggy monster to feel."

    "note": " The British imperial enterprise from the 18th century to the 20th, and particularly the frenzied rush to control African territories in the late 19th, afforded opportunities for employment and profit to many Irishmen. During that long span of imperial ambition, the British Army drew large numbers of recruits, as well as separately standing regiments, from countries other than England—Scotland and Ireland chief among them. In Joyce's Dublin, stories circulate of men who have joined the British armed forces, and also of unscrupulous individuals who have made obscene profits off the war machine.",
    "expandedNote": " In Eumaeus, Bloom thinks \"Irish soldiers had as often fought for England as against her, more so in fact.\" At times in the 19th century, it was also true that more Irish troops were in uniform than English ones. The great famine of the late 1840s, and growing nationalism, reduced Irish enlistment from over 40 percent of the force earlier in the century to less than 10 percent by World War I, but the total numbers were still large. Nearly 30,000 Irishmen fought in the Second Boer War, just before the time represented in Ulysses. \n At the end of Telemachus Mulligan learns that his friend Seymour has \"Chucked medicine and [is] going in for the army.\" The swimmer who gives him this information about Seymour mentions that he saw a well-off girl named Lily \"Spooning with him last night on the pier.\" (The OED defines \"spoon\" as \"To make love, esp. in a sentimental or silly fashion.\") Mulligan asks, \"Is she up the pole?\" (OED: \"pregnant but unmarried\"). A pregnant girlfriend would explain Seymour’s sudden decision to abandon his study of medicine and secure one of the few near-certain sources of gainful employment available to young men in 1904 Dublin. \n In Nestor, Stephen thinks of one of his students' family as \"Welloff people, proud that their eldest son was in the navy.\" In Lotus Eaters Bloom contemplates recruiting posters on the wall of the post office, and in Lestrygonians he thinks of young revolutionaries who quickly change their tune: \"Few years' time half of them magistrates and civil servants. War comes on: into the army helterskelter.\" In Eumaeus, the old sailor calls Irish troops and sailors \"the backbone of our empire,\" while the innkeeper retorts that \"he cared nothing for any empire, ours or his, and considered no Irishman worthy of his salt that served it.\"\n Both of the Blooms have lost companions in the Boer War. Ithaca mentions a school friend of Bloom's named Percy Apjohn who was \"killed in action, Modder River,\" an engagement fought in the Cape Colony in November 1899. In Penelope Molly thinks of a young lieutenant that she flirted with in a very serious way at about the same time: \"that Pretoria and Ladysmith and Bloemfontein where Gardner lieut Stanley G 8th Bn 2nd East Lancs Rgt of enteric fever he was a lovely fellow in khaki and just the right height over me.\" The chapter later makes clear that Gardner has died of the fever. In wars fought before the age of antibiotics, it was very common for more men to die of infectious diseases than injuries. \n Craftier souls found ways of thriving without risking their necks. Mulligan says of Haines that \"His old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to Zulus or some bloody swindle or other”—jalap being a violent purgative obtained from the dried tuberous root of a Mexican vine of the morning-glory family. It should be noted that this story is probably pure invention. Trench’s father apparently enjoyed a distinguished career in the army and was a scholar rather than a huckster; he published several military studies.\n Cyclops reports a similar rumor about Blazes Boylan’s father: “Dirty Dan the dodger’s son off Island bridge that sold the same horses twice over to the government to fight the Boers.” Penelope at least partially confirms this story, when Molly thinks that “his father made his money over selling the horses for the cavalry.”"

  "010006introibo": {
    "note": " \"Introibo ad altare Dei\": Mulligan’s first words initiate a mocking parody of the Catholic Mass, though in retrospect the stage has been set by his “stately” appearance carrying a bowl on which a mirror and razor lie “crossed.” In his mock ritual, the shaving bowl represents the chalice (or ciborium, or pyx) that holds the wine which will become changed into the blood of Christ. The Latin phrase means “I will go up to the altar of God.”",
    "expandedNote": " The words are taken from Psalm 43 (42 in the Vulgate), which expresses a desire to find refuge in God. In the days of the Latin Mass (pre-1964) it was chanted by the celebrant as he prepared to ascend the steps of the altar. The first two of the following three video clips show priests and their servers approaching the altar in an Irish and a Polish church. The third video presents a skilled Italian chanter singing the Introibo. \n Gifford observes that the server assisting the celebrant of the Mass responds to his Introibo by quoting from the next line of the Psalm: Ad Deum qui laetificat juventutem meam, “To God who gladdens my youth.” When Father Malachi O'Flynn celebrates an even more diabolic black mass in Circe by singing \"Introibo ad altare diaboli,\" his server perverts the responsory line too: \"To the devil which hath made glad my young days.\" \n Stephen, who thinks of himself later in Telemachus as a server (and thus a servant) to Mulligan, does not speak the line responsorially to Mulligan’s Introibo, but he too speaks it in a twisted way in Circe, as he approaches the brothel where he hopes to meet his favorite prostitute: “Georgina Johnson, ad deam qui laetificat iuventutem meam.” By making Georgina into a goddess (deam), Stephen perverts the language of the Mass just as Mulligan does with his \"genuine Christine,\" and insinuates the serious thought that, in this secular world, human sexual love fulfills a need which medieval men and women turned to God to satisfy.\n The two men differ greatly in their attitudes toward religious mystery. To Mulligan it is mere humbug. For Stephen, the rites of the Catholic Church deserve respect and even veneration, as forms of spiritual apprehension that literary art may learn from. Like Joyce in his twenties, he recurs often to religious metaphors to express what he wants to do in his art. One of these powerful religious symbols is the transubstantiation effected in the Mass. In the final section of A Portrait, after renouncing his religious vocation and choosing the life of an artist, he thinks of himself as “a priest of eternal imagination, transmuting the daily bread of experience into the radiant body of eternal life”—a function that surpasses the actions of a parish priest, “one who was but schooled in the discharging of a formal rite” (240). Later in Telemachus, it will become apparent that Stephen despises Mulligan’s mocking attitude toward religious faith, even though Stephen himself is an apostate, bitterly determined to \"kill the priest and the king\" and free himself from subjection.\n The mock Mass may have yet another function in the opening ofUlysses. Gifford plausibly suggests that, since the Homeric epics begin with an invocation of the poetic Muse, Mulligan’s “intoned” words do not only mock religion. They also suggest that this will be a mock-epic. When the book was first published, its title spurred debate about whether its adventures should be seen only as a mockingly debased version of great Greek antecedents, or as a more serious instantiation of Homeric patterns. To some degree that uncertainty still continues, as do questions about how extensive and significant the book’s Homeric parallels may be. Joyce’s parodic relation to his elevated epic source, and to the religion of his youth, is deeply ambiguous—at once respectful and irreverent, preservative and transformative."

  "010078invisibility": {
    "note": " In Telemachus Stephen recalls his mother laughing at lines she heard sung in a pantomime: \"I am the boy / That can enjoy / Invisibility.\" A magical rose gives the main character this power and he delightedly imagines how he can use it, singing \"Invisibility is just the thing for me.\" The mood of the song is light and comical, but invisibility is a power that Stephen associates with the greatest kinds of literary art, and he may aspire to wield it himself.",
    "expandedNote": " Like Sindbad the Sailor, which figures prominently inUlysses, Turko the Terrible, or, The Fairy Roses was a Christmas pantomime. Thornton notes that its first Dublin performance was in 1873, initiating a long line of pantomimes staged at the Gaiety Theatre. He quotes from an 1899 review in The Irish Playgoer that judged King Turko's ode to invisibility the most successful song in the show, and he observes that inSurface and Symbol Robert M. Adams suggests that the show Joyce had in mind was not Turko itself, but an 1892 performance of Sindbad which reprised this one highly popular song. The music survives, and in 2010 it was given a spirited rendition in a café theater presentation of Joyce’s songs in Bewley’s Café on Grafton Street. The artists, Sinead Murphy and Darina Gallagher, bill themselves as the Shannon Colleens.\n These three lines of light verse may possibly spark some serious thoughts in Stephen. Just after reciting them in memory, he thinks of his mother \"Folded away in the memory of nature,\" a reference to the theosophical idea of a universal memory of all events in the history of the cosmos, encoded on the spiritual plane that a person enters after death. Since his mother has entered that hidden dimension of existence, and is now perfectly recalling all the events of her life, not to mention those of all other lives, she might very well say, \"I am the girl that can enjoy invisibility.\"\n Stephen may also be thinking about invisibility and perfect mental possession in relation to himself. In part 5 of A Portrait of the Artist, he described three hierarchically ranked kinds of literary art: the lyric, the epic, and the dramatic. The “dramatic” artist exceeds the powers of the others because he transcends his own subjective position, submerging authorial consciousness in the presentation of how life is experienced by other people. This transcendence of ego makes the dramatist comparable to God: “The artist, like the God of the creation, remains within or behind or beyond or above his handiwork, invisible, refined out of existence, indifferent, paring his fingernails.”\n Stephen has thus far found no such sublime self-effacement. But by characterizing it as divinely creative he has given himself a goal to aim for, and the goal remains the same in Ulysses. In Scylla and Charybdis, he maps the figure of the self-effacing artistic god onto the dramatic artist par excellence, William Shakespeare, who in writing his plays (particularly Hamlet) became “a ghost, a shadow now, the wind in Elsinore’s rocks or what you will, the seas’ voice.” In Circe, as Stephen and Bloom gaze into a mirror, “The face of William Shakespeare, beardless, appears there, rigid in facial paralysis, crowned by the reflection of the reindeer antlered hatrack in the hall.” To Bloom, whose cuckoldry the antlers reflect, the bard speaks: “Thou thoughtest as how thou wastest invisible.” \n The man in the macintosh who mysteriously appears in Hades, and just as suddenly disappears, seems to share in this uncanny power: \"Where has he disappeared to? Not a sign. Well of all the. Has anybody here seen? Kay ee double ell. Become invisible. Good Lord, what became of him?\""

  "020077homestead": {
    "note": " In response to Mr. Deasy's request that he place his letter about foot and mouth disease in two newspapers, Stephen thinks of the Evening Telegraph and the \"Irish Homestead.\" The Homestead was a weekly newspaper of relatively small circulation, targeted at rural readers. Stephen names it because he knows that George Russell works there, and the novel seems to be obliquely alluding to the fact that Russell published Joyce's earliest stories in this newspaper.",
    "expandedNote": " The Homestead was published from 1895 to 1923. Russell edited the paper from 1905 to 1923, as a consequence of his work with rural cooperatives for Sir Horace Plunkett's Irish Agricultural Organisation Society. In 1904 he was working at the paper under the general editorship of H. F. Norman. Stephen's choice of the Homestead as a second venue for the letter reflects his acquaintance with Russell, and he is probably expecting to encounter him in the National Library later in the day. The two men do in fact meet in Scylla and Charybdis, and when Russell gets up to leave, saying, \"I am afraid I am due at the Homestead,\" Stephen stands up with him and says, \"If you will be so kind as to give the letter to Mr Norman...\" To himself he thinks, \"The pigs' paper.\" The Homestead focused on agrarian issues.\n The Homestead also, however, published Joyce's first short stories. When Joyce was begging friends for the loan of a pound in 1904, Russell (who had read and enjoyed Stephen Hero) offered to pay him that sum for \"a short story suitable for the Irish Homestead, something 'simple, rural?, livemaking?, pathos? [pathetic].'\" He suggested that \"It is easily earned money if you can write fluently and don't mind playing to the common understanding and liking for once in a way. You can sign it any name you like as a pseudonym.\"\n Joyce wrote \"The Sisters\" (in a version different from the one that eventually began Dubliners) and received asovereign in payment. Loath to publish in the pigs' paper under his own name, he accepted Russell's suggestion and wrote as Stephen Daedalus. The story appeared in August 1904. The Homestead also published \"Eveline\" in September 1904, shortly before Joyce left Ireland with Nora Barnacle, and \"After the Races\" in December of the same year. But Joyce was definitely not \"playing to the common understanding and liking,\" and by the end of the year there were so many objections to his stories that he was asked not to submit any more. He responded, typically, by including Russell in the host of betrayers that he assaulted in his poem The Holy Office."

  "120009irishindependent": {
    "note": " Today the \"Irish Independent\" is the daily newspaper with the largest circulation in Ireland, but at the time of the novel's events it was a somewhat smaller concern called the Irish Daily Independent, founded in 1890 to support Charles Stewart Parnell. In Circe the Citizen expresses contempt for the current state of a paper \"founded by Parnell to be the workingman's friend.\" He probably would have abominated even more strongly the new version of the paper, which was launched in January 1905 and has now lasted for more than a century. It viciously attacked the labor union movement during the Dublin lockout of 1913.",
    "expandedNote": "When the divorce trial of Captain William O'Shea and his wife Katharine tore apart Parnell's Irish Parliamentary Party, the Irish DailyIndependent was launched by the faction still loyal to the toppled Chief. It opposed the positions of the Freeman's Journal, which had stuck with Parnell through much of the controversy but finally broke away on 21 September 1891, two weeks before his death. By 16 June 1904, however, the warring factions had largely reconciled, and the Independent, as it was commonly called, was owned by William Martin Murphy, a nationalist but staunchly anti-Parnellite businessman from Bantry. \n According to a page on the website www.irishnewsarchive.com, accessed 13 October 2018, Murphy acquired the paper \"around 1904, to prevent the Freeman's Journal from purchasing the title\" and thereby to thwart that large paper from monopolizing the nationalist press. He achieved total victory in 1924, when the Independent acquired the Freeman. For decades afterward, the masthead of the Independent bore the legend \"Incorporating the Freeman's Journal.\" Aeolus alludes to these endless newspaper wars when Bloom recalls that before moving to its great rival, \"Myles Crawford began on the Independent. Funny the way those newspaper men veer about when they get wind of a new opening. Weathercocks. Hot and cold in the same breath. Wouldn’t know which to believe. One story good till you hear the next. Go for one another baldheaded in the papers and then all blows over. Hail fellow well met the next moment.\"\n The Citizen appears to object mainly to the Independent's cultivation of an English audience. He reads out various names and addresses from accounts of births, deaths, and marriages in the 16 June 1904 issue, all of them English, and concludes, \"How’s that for a national press, eh, my brown son! How’s that for Martin Murphy, the Bantry jobber?\" Although he is reading from an actual paper, he is doing so selectively. As Gifford shows from careful examination of that day's issue, the Citizen skips over Irish-born babies, marriages, and deaths to concentrate on the offending English names. Although the names sound distinctly upper-class and Protestant, and hence arguably anti-working class, the Citizen does not say anything about the paper's positions on labor issues.\n Murphy's successor paper, the Irish Independent, launched on 2 January 1905, adopted a policy of implacable hostility to labor unions when James Larkin, centered in Dublin from 1908 onward, began organizing Ireland's miserably poor and powerless workers. Larkin's union staged successful strikes beginning in 1911, and in 1912 he and James Connolly founded the Irish Labour Party to advance labor issues in the British Parliament. The capitalist backlash against these efforts was led by Martin Murphy, who chaired the Dublin United Tramway Company and owned various other businesses, including the Independentand the Evening Herald.\n In July 1913, Murphy organized a meeting of more than 300 Dublin employers to crush the trade union movement. He dismissed several hundred of his employees whom he suspected of belonging to Larkin's Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, and, beginning in late August, businesses across Dublin (not including the Guinness brewery) locked out their workers. The massive lockout was strengthened by strike-breakers and by Dublin Metropolitan Police forces that charged workers at rallies, killing several and injuring hundreds. Throughout the lockout, Murphy's Independent portrayed Larkin as a demonic troublemaker endangering social order. Workers capitulated early in 1914.\n Sirens offers one more example of someone carrying about a copy of the Independent, when a gentleman drinking at the bar asks Miss Kennedy about the viceregal cavalcade that has just passed by: \"Did she know where the lord lieutenant was going? And heard steelhoofs ringhoof ring. No, she couldn’t say.But it would be in the paper. O, she need not trouble. No trouble. She waved about her outspread Independent, searching, the lord lieutenant, her pinnacles of hair slowmoving, lord lieuten. Too much trouble, first gentleman said. O, not in the least.\""

The law was titled \"An Act for Promoting the Trade of Dublin, by rendering its Port and Harbour more commodious.\" Precursor bodies had been authorized by various English monarchs, however, and in the 19th century various laws passed by the combined Parliament of Great Britain and Ireland in Westminster continued to modify the composition and duties of the board. Today, the CIL continues to operate under both Irish and British law. The UK funds the body with dues raised from ships that use the seas around Ireland, because many ocean-going ships use the lights but do not put in to Irish ports."

  "080012irishtimes": {
    "note": " In Lestrygonians Bloom walks by the offices of the \"Irish Times\" at 31 Westmoreland Street, heading south. The Times, a daily newspaper, has lasted from 1859 to the present day. In 1904 it was one of three Dublin newspapers that enjoyed a large national circulation, along with the Freeman's Journal and the Evening Telegraph, and it espoused modestly conservative, unionist politics. Bloom considers it the \"Best paper by long chalks for a small ad.Got the provinces now.\" Among other occasions when he may have put this conviction into practice, the Times has published the ad that put \"Henry Flower\" in touch with \"Martha Clifford.\"",
    "expandedNote": " Lestrygonians gives us most of what we can know about this solicitation: \"He passed the Irish Times. There might be other answers lying there. Like to answer them all. Good system for criminals. Code. At their lunch now. Clerk with the glasses there doesn't know me. O, leave them there to simmer. Enough bother wading through fortyfour of them. Wanted, smart lady typist to aid gentleman in literary work.\" \n Bloom, then, has placed an ad in the Times for a \"smart lady typist,\" and he has waded through the first 44 replies, at least one of which satisfied his desire to conduct intimate personal correspondence with anonymous women possessing at least a minimal interest in literary writing. One of the hallucinations in Circe ties Bloom's guilty secret to the enabling newspaper: Martha comes forward, \"(Thickveiled, a crimson halter round her neck, a copy of the Irish Times in her hand, in tone of reproach, pointing.) Henry! Leopold! Lionel, thou lost one! Clear my name.\"\n Bloom's program of placing personal ads in the Times clearly goes beyond this one instance of surreptitious erotic correspondence. In Penelope, Molly remembers having lost a pair of gloves at the Dublin Bakery Corporation: \"I forgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that I never got after some robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the Irish times lost in the ladies lavatory D B C Dame street finder return to Mrs Marion Bloom.\" The circumstances are very different from the lady typist ad, but the willingness to entrust personal needs to a public forum is very similar. Molly's \"he wanted\" makes blazingly clear her response to Bloom's wish to give thousands of daily readers the mental image of her sitting on a toilet seat in the DBC.\n Fargnoli and Gillespie note that \"While he was away in Paris from 1902 to 1903, Joyce repeatedly tried to earn money by selling articles on Paris and Parisian life to this paper. The 7 April 1903 issue carried his essay 'The Motor Derby: Interview with the French Champion (from a correspondent),' which focused on Henry Fournier, the leading contender for the James Gordon Bennett Cup, an automobile race to be held in Dublin that July. The article provided Joyce with background that he would incorporate into his Dubliners story 'After the Race.' After he had left Ireland permanently, Joyce relied on the Irish Times as a source of information about Ireland.\""

  "030015irishtown": {
    "note": " \"Irishtown\" is a suburb on the seacoast east of Dublin, south of the River Liffey and north of Sandymount. The name dates to the 15th century, when the English rulers of Dublin became fearful of being outnumbered by the natives and enacted statutes (consonant with the 1366 Statutes of Kilkenny) that banned Irish people from living within the city limits or doing business there past daylight hours. The natives built their own shabbier town outside the walls. \"Strasburg terrace,\" where Stephen's Aunt Sara lives with her husband Richie Goulding and their children, is a short street or row of townhouses slightly east of Irishtown Road, the avenue that bisects the town from north to south.",
    "expandedNote": " Later in the 20th century land was reclaimed from the sea on the eastern edge of Irishtown, and now Strasburg Terrace is a short dead-end street running eastward from Strand Street, across from a small green. But in 1904 the sea lay just past that little strip of land, so it would be very easy for Stephen to turn northwest and walk across the sands to his aunt's house. He stops and thinks about it: \"His pace slackened. Here. Am I going to aunt Sara's or not?\" After imagining the scene that would greet him in the house he sees his feet heading northeast toward the Pigeon House and decides that he will not be visiting his relatives today. (Or staying the night, either. Since he thinks that he will not be returning to Mulligan's tower at the end of the day, it seems possible that he has been thinking of asking the Gouldings whether he could move in with them temporarily.)\n In Hades the funeral carriages roll through Irishtown on the Tritonville/Irishtown Road and, just past \"Watery lane,\" Bloom spots Stephen walking along the road. Watery Lane, now Dermot O'Hurley Avenue, lies a few blocks west of Strasburg Terrace, and Simon Dedalus supposes, understandably but incorrectly, that his son has been visiting the Gouldings. Bloom too wonders what Stephen has been up to. In Aeolus he thinks back on the sighting: \"Has a good pair of boots on him today. Last time I saw him he had his heels on view. Been walking in muck somewhere. Careless chap. What was he doing in Irishtown?\" \n In Eumaeus Bloom is still thinking about the area: \"things always moved with the times. Why, as he reflected, Irishtown strand, a locality he had not been in for quite a number of years looked different somehow since, as it happened, he went to reside on the north side.\" He decides that perhaps Stephen was paying a call on a nice girl: \"It was a thousand pities a young fellow, blessed with an allowance of brains as his neighbour obviously was, should waste his valuable time with profligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last him his lifetime. In the nature of single blessedness he would one day take unto himself a wife when Miss Right came on the scene but in the interim ladies’ society was a conditio sine qua non though he had the gravest possible doubts, not that he wanted in the smallest to pump Stephen about Miss Ferguson (who was very possibly the particular lodestar who brought him down to Irishtown so early in the morning), as to whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea.\" Miss Ferguson, of course, is a creature of Bloom's imagination, prompted by hearing Stephen recite Yeats' Fergus poem. The female he is currently taken with, Georgina Johnson, is precisely one of those \"profligate women.\"\n An intrusion into section 13 of Wandering Rocks shows the two old women whom Stephen observed on the beach walking back to the south side of Dublin: \"Two old women fresh from their whiff of the briny trudged through Irishtown along London bridge road.\" The London Bridge crosses the River Dodder about a quarter of a mile south of where the funeral cortège crosses it at Dodder Bridge. Once it has passed over the bridge and departed Irishtown, Londonbridge Road becomes Bath Avenue. The final section of Wandering Rocks makes clear that the two women have proceeded west along Bath Avenue and then southwest along Haddington Road. The penultimate sentence of section 19 finds them \"At Haddington road corner,\" watching the viceregal cavalcade roll by on Northumberland Road from the corner of those two streets."

He has thought a little earlier of his promise to meet Mulligan at \"The Ship, half twelve,\" i.e. in about an hour. He fails to show, but proceeds instead to the newspaper office, where after a decorous interval he proposes that \"the house do now adjourn\" to a pub. It is the beginning of a very long day of drinking."

    "note": " In Proteus Stephen thinks, \"Isle of Saints,\"\nand in Cyclops the Citizen exclaims, \"Island of saints and sages!\" They are voicing a common Irish expression that recalls the early medieval times when Irish monks like Columbanus brought Christian spirituality and learning to Europe after the collapse of the Roman empire. The phrase also evokes the title of a lecture, \"Ireland, Island of Saints and Sages,\" that James Joyce delivered in 1907 at the Università Popolare in Trieste, introducing to Italians the notion that his island once housed a great civilization.",
    "expandedNote": " In the talk, Joyce observed that Irish people cling to the phrase because \"Nations have their ego, just like individuals.\" The spiritual character of Ireland was established long before the arrival of Christianity: \"The Druid priests had their temples in the open, and worshipped the sun and moon in groves of oak trees. In the crude state of knowledge of those times, the Irish priests were considered very learned, and when Plutarch mentions Ireland, he says that it was the dwelling place of holy men. Festus Avienus in the fourth century was the first to give Ireland the title of Insula Sacra; and later, after having undergone the invasions of the Spanish and Gaelic tribes, it was converted to Christianity by St. Patrick and his followers, and again earned the title of 'Holy Isle'.\"\n In the Christian era, the druids' highly learned priesthood gave way to monastic scholarship that kept the intellectual traditions of the West alive through the Dark Ages: \"It seems undeniable that Ireland at that time was an immense seminary, where scholars gathered from the different countries of Europe, so great was its renown for mastery of spiritual matters.\" Joyce stresses that he is not speaking of Christianity for its own sake, but because in those days it sheltered and fostered learning, art, and spirituality: \"in the centuries in which they occurred and in all the succeeding Middle Ages, not only history itself, but the sciences and the various arts were all completely religious in character, under the guardianship of a more than maternal church.\" \n The relentless Viking invasions of the 9th and 10th centuries weakened this civilization, and the Anglo-Norman invasions of the 12th century sealed its fate: \"Ireland ceased to be an intellectual force in Europe. The decorative arts, at which the ancient Irish excelled, were abandoned, and the sacred and profane culture fell into disuse.\" Eight centuries of colonial capitulation and degradation followed, with the result that \"the present race in Ireland is backward and inferior.\" \"Ancient Ireland is dead just as ancient Egypt is dead.\" \n But the Irish genius has remained alive throughout that time, Irish industry and ingenuity have flourished in foreign countries, and Irish valor has won Britain's wars. \"Is this country destined to resume its ancient position as the Hellas of the north some day? Is the Celtic mind, like the Slavic mind which it resembles in many ways, destined to enrich the civil conscience with new discoveries and new insights in the future? Or must the Celtic world, the five Celtic nations, driven by stronger nations to the edge of the continent, to the outermost islands of Europe, finally be cast into the ocean after a struggle of centuries?\"\n Joyce acknowledges that he cannot answer these questions. But \"even a superficial consideration will show us that the Irish nation's insistence on developing its own culture by itself is not so much the demand of a young nation that wants to make good in the European concert as the demand of a very old nation to renew under new forms the glories of a past civilization.\""

  "160003isoscelestriangle": {
    "note": " Ruthlessly mocking Bloom's romantic stereotype of Spaniards, Italians, and other Mediterranean peoples as hotblooded types, Stephen lobs some counter-examples in Eumaeus: \"we have the impetuosity of Dante and the isosceles triangle, Miss Portinari, he fell in love with and Leonardo and san Tommaso Mastino.\" The Trinitarian numerology of Dante Alighieri, the serene mathematics of Leonardo da Vinci, and the massive logic of Thomas Aquinas all would suggest that an Italian can be just as cerebral as the next guy.",
    "expandedNote": " Stephen's sardonic picture of Dante falling hotly in love with a triangle refers to the poet's unprecedented abstraction of the experience of love. Dante reconciled the adored lady of troubadour erotic tradition with Christian theology at a high cost: he made her almost entirely a vessel of insight into the disembodied truths of divinity. This transformation is realized most fully in the Paradiso (finished not long before his death in 1321), but the groundwork for it was laid in the Vita Nuova (1295). The relentless Trinitarian echoes in the Divine Comedy have their origin in the obsessive numerology of this early work, where the spiritual exaltation of encountering something utterly new (nuova or nova) in Beatrice overlaps constantly with the number nine (nove).\n The remarkable canzone in section 19 of the Vita Nuova presents Beatrice (the \"Miss Portinari\" that Boccaccio identified as the object of Dante's adoration) as a divinely created miracle (\"God intended to make something utterly new\") who can lead the mind to heaven. When Beatrice's death is announced in section 28, the reader receives, not an outflowing of emotion, but \"three reasons\" for not talking about the loss in any detail, and a disquisition on a related number: \"since the number nine has appeared many times in what I have already written (which clearly could not happen without a reason), and since in her departure this number seemed to play an important part, it is fitting that I say something here concerning this, inasmuch as it seems to fit in with my plan\" (trans. Mark Musa). \n Section 29 explains: \"Let me begin by saying that if one counts in the Arabian way, her most noble soul departed this life during the first hour of the ninth day of the month, and if one counts the way they do in Syria, she departed in the ninth month of the year, the first month there being Tixryn the First, which for us is October. And according to our own way of reckoning, she departed in that year of our Christian era (that is in the year of Our Lord) in which the perfect number [i.e., ten] had been completed nine times in that century in which she had been placed in this world: she was a Christian of the Thirteenth Century. One reason why this number was in such harmony with her might be this: since, according to Ptolemy and according to Christian truth, there are nine heavens that move, and since, according to widespread astrological opinion, these heavens affect the earth below according to the relations they have to one another, this number was in harmony with her to make it understood that at her birth all nine of the moving heavens were in perfect relationship to one another. But this is just one reason. If anyone thinks more subtly and according to infallible truth, it will be clear that this number was she herself—that is, by analogy. What I mean to say is this: the number three is the root of nine, for, without any other number, multiplied by itself, it gives nine: it is quite clear that three times three is nine. Therefore, if three is the sole factor of nine, and the sole factor of miracles is three, that is, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, who are Three in One, then this lady was accompanied by the number nine so that it might be understood that she was a nine, or a miracle, whose root, namely that of the miracle, is the miraculous Trinity itself. Perhaps someone more subtle than I could find a still more subtle explanation, but this is the one which I see and which pleases me the most\" (trans. Musa). Not only Stephen's absurd image of Beatrice as a triangle but also her equal-sidedness (\"isosceles\" can refer to triangles with two or more sides of equal length) make sense in the context of this passage.\n Leonardo da Vinci, another Florentine with an interest in divine order, pairs well with Dante's architectonic rationality. In addition to his well-known labors in natural science and engineering, Leonardo indulged a keen interest in geometric shapes and numerical ratios. His Last Supper andMona Lisa have been shown to make use of antiquity's \"golden ratio\" of approximately 1.6:1 (based on the irrational number phi which begins 1.6180339887). Leonardo explored the use of linear perspective in paintings like The Adoration of the Magi and was probably the first European artist to employ the technique of anamorphosis. Perhaps most relevant to Stephen's conception of Dante, he also embraced the classical idea that man is the measure of all things, a quintessential creation whose proportions reveal the divine mathematics underlying all of reality. \n In the notebook drawing he called Vitruvian Man, or \"The proportions of the human body according to Vitruvius,\" Leonardo illustrated the Roman builder's belief that ideal human proportions should inform works of architecture. In the text above and below the drawing he articulates many of Vitruvius' observations. Among them: the length of a man's outstretched arms are equal to his height; the length of the face from chin to hairline is one tenth of the total height; the length of the open hand from the wrist to the tip of the middle finger is the same; the maximum width of the shoulders is a quarter of the height; the distance from the elbow to the tip of the fingers is a quarter of the height; the base of the penis lies at one half of the height; the distance from the bottom of the feet to the bottom of the knee is one quarter of the height; and \"if you open your legs enough that your head is lowered by one-fourteenth of your height and raise your hands enough that your extended fingers touch the line of the top of your head, know that the center of the extended limbs will be the navel, and the space between the legs will be [aha!] an equilateral triangle.\" \n About Thomas Aquinas (\"san Tommaso Mastino\" means \"Saint Thomas the Mastiff,\" or \"The bulldog of Aquin\" as Stephen calls him in Scylla and Charybdis), little commentary is needed. The Summa Theologica and Summa Contra Gentiles are among the most hyper-rational texts ever produced. Simply reading their tables of contents yields the impression that all of creation can be comprehended, divided, subdivided, pigeonholed, articulated, clarified, and harmonized by human logic. Thomas would have been associated with Dante in Stephen's thoughts because so many ideas of the Commedia were taken from his writings."

By putting these two formidable singers on a stage with Molly, Joyce was recreating a glorious moment from his own past in August 1904.",
    "expandedNote": " John C. Doyle was born in Dublin in 1866, the same year as the fictional Leopold Bloom. Gifford notes that he \"won the award at the 1899 Feis Ceoil,\" an annual Dublin music festival established in 1897 that is still held today. Vivien Igoe records that Doyle made a career in the Telegraphs Office of the General Post Office, avoiding the risks of a full-time singing career in order to support a wife and eight children. But he \"sang at concerts, soirées, and salons in Dublin and other parts of the country, and also performed in England and Scotland. With his fine voice and his matinée-idol good looks, Pathé described him as 'the darling of the Irish concert platform'.\" Slote notes that he also sang at the Carmelite Church on Whitefriars Street from 1901 until his retirement in 1936.\n On 22 August 1904 Joyce invited Nora to hear him sing at an afternoon concert. Then, Ellmann observes, \"he was invited to share the platform at the Antient Concert Rooms with John McCormack and J. C. Doyle on August 27, the last night of the Horse Show Week. It was the high point of his musical career.\" One reviewer described the concert's disastrously poor organization, which gave Joyce material for \"A Mother\": when his accompanist left early (as Kathleen Kearney does in the Dublinersstory) and her replacement proved incompetent, \"one of the vocalists, Mr. James A. Joyce, had to sit down at the piano and accompany himself in the song In Her Simplicity, after she had made several unsuccessful attempts to strum outThe Croppy Boy, the item programmed over the singer's name....Mr. Joyce possesses a light tenor voice, which he is inclined to force on the high notes but sings with artistic emotionalism\" (168). \n A review in the Freeman's Journal, also quoted in Ellmann's biography, gave a less mixed impression of the event, noting that \"Mr. J. C. Doyle sang a number of songs in first-rate style....Mr. James A. Joyce, the possessor of a sweet tenor voice, sang charmingly The Sally Gardens, and gave a pathetic rendering of The Croppy Boy....Mr. J. F. M'Cormack was the hero of the evening. It was announced as his last public appearance in Ireland, and the evident feeling of the audience at the parting seemed to unnerve him a good deal\" (168n). Nora was greatly impressed with her lover, and would tell people for years that \"Jim should have stuck to music instead of bothering with writing\" (169). Instead, he transferred his triumph to Molly, giving readers a high impression of the quality of her singing by associating her with Doyle and McCormack.\n Thanks to Vincent Altman O'Connor for uploading to Youtube the recording of Doyle's singing posted here."

    "note": " The \"Jakes M'Carthy\" whom Myles Crawford mentions in the context of Stephen's future in journalism is not a generic name for random Irishmen. He was a well-known sports reporter, and the editor seems to regard him with the same professional pride that he feels for Ignatius Gallaher, whom he brings up in the following section of Aeolus.",
    "expandedNote": " John M'Carthy, who used the pen name \"Jacques,\" pronounced \"Jakes,\" covered Irish football teams from the 1870s until his death in 1901. Vivien Igoe calls him \"a conspicuous figure in the world of sport, whose wit, genial temperament and kindly nature won him friends in many circles.\" She cites his most famous piece of reportage, an account of an Irish rugby player's brilliant try against an English team: \"Ryan crossed the line festooned with Saxons.\" (Fans of American football will hear in this account an echo of the \"beast mode\" style of running practiced by Marshawn Lynch.) The phrase \"festooned with Saxons\" lives on in Irish rugby lore to this day.\n Igoe supplies other anecdotes. Asked at some point to define the three forms of football, M'Carthy considered the question and replied, \"In rugby you kick the ball; in soccer you kick the man if you can't kick the ball; in Gaelic you kick the ball if you can't kick the man; and the use of the knife is forbidden before half time.\" (\"Football\" largely meant rugby in Joyce's day, not soccer.) The same wit was on display when, during one of his periodic spells of unemployment, M'Carthy was talking to a friend on O'Connell Bridge and saw a newsboy run past with a placard announcing trouble between Russia and Japan: \"Situation in the Far East.\" He said to his friend, \"I wonder, should I apply for it.\"\n In a personal communication, Senan Molony notes that M'Carthy wrote for Sport, the same weekly paper, published by the Freeman's Journal, whose just-released \"tissues\" (flimsy racing forms) Lenehan has brought into the Evening Telegraph office. Crawford may well be gesturing toward those sheets when he says, \"Father, Son and Holy Ghost and Jakes M'Carthy.\" Molony adds that \"Joyce as a good Belvederian loved rugby (even if he preferred to play cricket). He attended the Stade de Colombes for Irish rugby internationals against France when he lived in Paris.\""

  "100009jamessgate": {
    "note": " The 12th section of Wandering Rocks opens with Tom Kernan walking eastward \"From the sundial towards James's gate,\" along James's Street on the far western edge of Dublin. Later in the section he turns north toward the river. His walk is marked by proximity to a pub, a drinking fountain, an immense brewery, and an immense distillery.",
    "expandedNote": " Just before the action begins, Kernan has exited a pub run by \"Mr Crimmins,\" where he has secured an order of some tea for his employer while downing two glasses of the proprietor's \"best gin.\" The pub still exists on the south side of James's Street, but today it is called the Malt House. Mr. Kernan has turned right after leaving the premises, heading east on James's Street toward the center of town. The section begins with him congratulating himself on what he thinks of the brilliantly conversational way in which he has \"Got round\" Mr. Crimmins. He has walked about half a block from the pub and now stands across from a small plaza where Bow Lane West runs into James's Street from the northwest.\n The \"sundial\" that stands on this plaza is actually an obelisk bearing four sundials near its top and two water basins at its base. Commissioned by the Duke of Rutland (the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland), and designed by the architect Francis Sandys, it was erected in 1790. Originally, water apparently flowed from four ornamental heads into a large circular basin at pavement level, but at some point in the 19th century the large pool was paved over and two small drinking basins, manufactured by \"T. Kennedy, Patentee,\" were installed on opposite faces of the obelisk, with injunctions to \"Keep the pavement dry.\" The monument still stands, though the basins no longer quench anyone's thirst or slicken any stones. Dublin Corporation commissioned a company to restore the stonework in 1995, with financial help from Guinness Ireland and the Ireland Fund of Canada. \n \"James's Gate,\" toward which Mr. Kernan is walking at the beginning of the section, began life in the 13th century as the westernmost gate to the walled city of Dublin. The medieval gate was demolished in 1734, but the name remained attached to the spot at the eastern end of James's Street where it passes Watling Street and becomes Thomas Street West.\n The area and the name have been associated with brewing since the 17th century. In 1759 Arthur Guinness signed a 9,000-year lease on four acres and founded the St. James's Gate Brewery. His company later bought those acres and about 50 others nearby, building production and storage facilities south of James's Gate and north all the way to the river, whence barges could transport their product past Carlisle (O'Connell) Bridge to waiting ships for export. Varieties of the famous Guinness stout (\"the black stuff\" in Dublin) have been brewed near James's Gate since the late 1700s, and at some point the company erected its own gateway into the brewing facilities, opening off the south side of James's Gate, to honor and capitalize on the medieval gateway that once led into the city. \n The most direct route for Kernan to take back to his office would be to pass by this gate on his right and continue along Thomas Street, heading east. Instead the narration observes that he \"turned and walked down the slope of Watling street by the corner of Guinness's visitors' waitingroom,\" which the company built across from the gate, on the north side of the street, for people waiting to tour their brewing facilities. As he turns left onto Watling Street Kernan walks by this facility, which no longer exists. In the 21st century its functions have been more than replaced by the Guinness Storehouse, in the block of brewery buildings south of James's Gate. An architecturally ambitious building, the Storehouse contains six floors of museum-like displays and a seventh-floor bar offering excellent 360-degree views of Dublin.\n As he walks north on Watling Street toward the river, skirting the Guinness storage facilities on his left, Mr. Kernan sees on the right hand side of the road a jaunting car left unattended \"Outside the Dublin Distillers Company's stores.\" This large two-story warehouse building, which still stands, was constructed in 1866 as part of the huge Roe distillery on Thomas Street. Peter Roe founded the distillery in 1757, and over the course of the 19th century it grew to become the largest in Ireland and perhaps the world. In 1890, George Roe and Company's Thomas Street distillery combined with William Jameson's Marrowbone Lane distillery (different from John Jameson's Bow Street distillery) and the Dublin Whiskey Company's Jones Road distillery to form the ill-fated Dublin Distillers Company. The storehouse at 21-32 Watling Street was one of several buildings purchased by the Guinness company when the Thomas Street distillery closed during the Prohibition era and many of its structures were demolished.\n Kernan is then seen approaching \"Island street,\" which intersects Watling one block shy of the river. No further exact indications of his location are given in the section, but it can be inferred that as his interior monologue concludes he passes beyond Island Street and approaches the quays. The section ends with him seeing that he has just missed an opportunity to greet the viceregal cavalcade rolling eastward \"along Pembroke quay.\" \n Starting with two glasses of gin in Mr. Crimmins' pub, passing by a drinking fountain, threading the needle of the gargantuan Guinness complex, and finally passing by the largest of all Irish whiskey distilleries, Mr. Kernan's walk seems calculated to register as a geographical salute to human thirst."

  "010105japhet": {
    "note": " \"Japhet in search of a father\" is the name of a novel published in 1836 by Capt. Frederick Marryat, an English naval officer. It represents the efforts of a \"foundling\" (a child deserted by unknown parents) to find his father. By identifying Stephen with Japhet, Mulligan mocks his aspirations to spiritual paternity.",
    "expandedNote": " Thornton quotes several sentences from Japhet, in Search of a Father that typify Japhet's deep need for paternity: \"if I saw a nose upon any man's face, at all resembling my own, I immediately would wonder and surmise whether that person could be my father. This constant dwelling upon the subject at last created a species of monomania, and a hundred times a day I would mutter to myself, 'Who is my father?'\" After digesting Proteus and Scylla and Charybdis, the reader of Ulysses will realize that Stephen Dedalus has the same monomaniacal need—not for biological paternity (Simon Dedalus, or \"Kinch the elder,\" is alive and well in Dublin), but for a kind of spiritual paternity that will enable him to become an artist. \n Mulligan mocks this deep spiritual longing by comparing it to Marryat's obsessive character, whose searches do not amount to much; as Gifford observes, Japhet's father, \"when finally found, turns out to be a testy old East India officer.” But Ulysses makes Stephen something more than just poor Japhet, by analogizing him to more consequential sons: Telemachus and Hamlet.\n Together with William Cardell in England and Herman Melville in America, Marryat helped shape the genre of sea stories later popularized by Joseph Conrad, C. S. Forester, Dudley Pope, and Patrick O’Brian. In Ulysses (1987), Hugh Kenner notes the popularity of his fictions: \"Though the allusion seems recondite now, we are to imagine that this was a boy's book for Mulligan. Many Marryat titles abounded in cheap reprint as late as the 1930s\" (30)."

  "050013jauntingcar": {
    "note": " When the horse-drawn equivalent of an automotive taxicab appears in Ulysses (as happens quite often), it is a \"jaunting car,\" also known as an \"outside car,\" \"outsider,\" \"hackney car,\" or simply \"car.\" Uniquely Irish, these two-wheeled vehicles were used throughout the country for most of the 19th century and well into the 20th.",
    "expandedNote": " In 1904 they thronged the streets of Dublin, where they were licensed and numbered. Along with the fairly new urban tram system, and walking, they offered one of three major ways of getting around town, as represented by Tom Kernan's thoughts in Wandering Rocks, \"undecided whether he should arrive at Phibsborough more quickly by a triple change of tram or by hailing a car or on foot through Smithfield, Constitution hill and Broadstone terminus.\"\n Jaunting cars carried as many as four passengers, facing outward in two seats set high above the wheels. A metal step afforded access to the high seats. Between the seats lay a shallow well, running from front to back, which could hold parcels and luggage. Passengers sat with their backs against the walls of the well, resting their feet on footboards which could be folded up when not in use to shield the seats from bad weather. Nothing but blankets protected the passengers from bad weather, and fast driving around corners threatened to toss them from their precarious perches. Metal handholds at the four corners of the seats guarded against such accidents.\n In Lotus Eaters Bloom tries to take advantage of the high step up to the seat of the jaunting car to catch a glimpse of an elegant woman's undergarments. A couple is leaving the Grosvenor Hotel across the street, probably (he thinks) \"Off to the country.\" The man takes his time, fiddling in his pockets for the right change: \"Mr Bloom gazed across the road at the outsider drawn up before the door of the Grosvenor. The porter hoisted the valise up on the well. She stood still, waiting, while the man, husband, brother, like her, searched his pockets for change.\" \"Which side will she get up?\" wonders Bloom. \n Working his way to \"the side of M'Coy's talking head\" to get a clear line of sight, Bloom thinks that surely the woman will be \"Getting up in a minute.\" Catlike, he waits intently for his moment: \"Watch! Watch! Silk flash rich stockings white. Watch!\" But \"A heavy tramcar,\" the second most commonly mentioned kind of \"car\" in Ulysses, invades his field of vision, interrupting his vision of paradise. This episode recurs in Circe, when The Honourable Mrs Mervyn Talboys accuses Bloom of having \"observed me from behind a hackney car and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph.\"\n The sexual possibilities of the jaunting car surface also inWandering Rocks, when Lenehan tells M'Coy about a trip back from Glencree to Dublin late at night, over the Featherbed Mountain. Bloom and Chris Callinan took one side of the cart, and Lenehan and Molly the other. Lenehan relished at the time, and still relishes in the retelling, the way the bouncy car put him in contact with Molly's breasts: \"Every jolt the bloody car gave I had her bumping up against me. Hell's delights! She has a fine pair, God bless her.\" \n A jaunting car figures prominently again in Sirens, when one carries Blazes Boylan first to his appointment with Lenehan at the Ormond hotel, and then to his appointment with Molly in Eccles Street. Bloom spots the car moving toward the Ormond: \"He eyed and saw afar on Essex bridge a gay hat riding on a jaunting car. It is. Third time. Coincidence. / Jingling on supple rubbers it jaunted from the bridge to Ormond quay. Follow. Risk it. Go quick. At four.\" The \"jingle\" sound comes from harness bells that were mandated as a safety measure after Dublin's jaunting cars were fitted with rubber tires. Throughout Sirens Boylan's progress is marked by this sound. The overture sounds the motif \"Jingle jingle jaunted jingling,\" and the text works numerous variations on the theme: \"Jingle jaunty jingle\"; \"Jingle jaunted by the curb and stopped\"; \"Jingle a tinkle jaunted. Bloom heard a jing, a little sound. He's off. Light sob of breath Bloom sighed on the silent bluehued flowers. Jingling. He's gone. Jingle\"; \"Jingle jaunted down the quays. Blazes sprawled on bounding tyres.\"\n Bloom follows the car from the Essex Bridge to the Ormond Hotel, and after Boylan descends from his car and enters the bar to Lenehan's greeting, he walks gingerly past the cab: \"Between the car and window, warily walking, went Bloom, unconquered hero. See me he might. The seat he sat on: warm.\" He thinks that Boylan has kept the \"Car waiting.\" Sure enough, Boylan leaves before long, and the narrative follows his journey to 7 Eccles in car no. 324: \"A hackney car, number three hundred and twentyfour, driver Barton James of number one Harmony avenue, Donnybrook, on which sat a fare, a young gentleman, stylishly dressed in an indigoblue serge suit made by George Robert Mesias, tailor and cutter, of number five Eden quay, and wearing a straw hat very dressy, bought of John Plasto of number one Great Brunswick street, hatter. Eh? This is the jingle that joggled and jingled. By Dlugacz' porkshop bright tubes of Agendath trotted a gallantbuttocked mare.\" In one of the hallucinations of Circe, Lenehan joins Boylan on the car: \"A hackneycar, number three hundred and twentyfour, with a gallantbuttocked mare, driven by James Barton, Harmony Avenue, Donnybrook, trots past. Blazes Boylan and Lenehan sprawl swaying on the sideseats. The Ormond boots crouches behind on the axle.\" \n In Cyclops \"the castle car\" (a jaunting car leased by Dublin Castle?) brings Martin Cunningham and two companions (Jack Power and Crofton) to Barney Kiernan's pub, and at the end of the chapter these three men rescue Bloom by taking him away from the pub in the same car, with \"Martin telling the jarvey to drive ahead\" and \"Jack Power trying to get him to sit down on the car and hold his bloody jaw.\" The horse takes fright when the Citizen pitches his biscuit tin, the dog Garryowen lights out after the car, \"And the last we saw was the bloody car rounding the corner and old sheepsface on it gesticulating and the bloody mongrel after it with his lugs back for all he was bloody well worth to tear him limb from limb.\"\n The last major appearance of a jaunting car comes at the end of Circe, when Bloom is leaving Bella Cohen's: \"From the left arrives a jingling hackney car. It slows to in front of the house. Bloom at the halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is about to dismount from the car with two silent lechers.\" After the assault on Stephen, Bloom, \"Peering over the crowd,\" says, \"I just see a car there.\" Kelleher appears among the bystanders, responds to Bloom's plea for help, and calms the constables, assuring them that \"I've a car round there.\" Bloom seems interested in using the car to get Stephen away, and Kelleher offers to \"give him a lift home,\" thinking that he lives in the near NW suburb of Cabra. When he learns that Stephen lives far out in Sandycove, however, the offer is tacitly withdrawn."

  "010008jesuit": {
    "note": " Ulysses contains many references to the \"jesuits,\" a large order of Catholic priests and brothers known formally as \"the Society of Jesus,\" or \"S.J.\" The order was founded in the 16th century by Iñigo López de Oñaz y Loyola (1491-1566), a Spanish knight from a noble Basque family widely known by the Latin name Ignatius Loyola. Stephen Dedalus, like Joyce, has received a good Jesuit education during most of his pre-university years, and an official in both of the schools he attended, \"John Conmee S.J.,\" appears under his own name in both A Portrait and Ulysses.",
    "expandedNote": " The S.J. enjoys a reputation of being the most intellectually rigorous of the Catholic holy orders, a reputation based on its members’ work in education and intellectual research. The Jesuits operate seminaries, universities, secondary schools, and elementary schools in many countries around the world, including Ireland. They taught James Joyce at Clongowes Wood College in County Kildare from 1888 to 1891 (ages 6-9), and at Belvedere College in Dublin from 1893 to 1898 (ages 11-16). Joyce attended Belvedere on scholarship; the family fortunes had declined and this preparatory school, like many Jesuit institutions, underwrites the education of those who cannot afford to pay. \n A Portrait of the Artist represents Joyce’s experiences at both schools, including his stellar academic success at Belvedere where he won many honors and prizes. When the Jesuits invite Stephen Dedalus to consider that he may have a calling to become one of them, he declines, and walks away not only from the priesthood but also from the Catholic Church. In Telemachus, however, Mulligan suggests that Stephen has much further to go in ridding his mind of his religious instruction. He calls Stephen a \"fearful jesuit,\" suggesting that he has internalized the rigorous intellectual severity of the order, and also perhaps that in his sternly meditative way he is afraid of life. Later in the chapter, fending off Stephen's anger at his making light of his mother's death, Mulligan explains Stephen's refusal to pray at his mother's bedside by saying, \"you have the cursed jesuit strain in you, only it's injected the wrong way.\" Even in his rejection of Christianity, Mulligan seems to be saying, Stephen acts with an uncompromising (and unworldly) insistence on intellectual consistency that he learned from the Jesuits. \"Look at the sea. What does it care about offences? Chuck Loyola, Kinch, and come on down.\" In Oxen of the Sun, Mulligan is still lambasting Stephen as a \"Jesified, orchidised, polycimical jesuit!\" \n Stephen does not reject the association with Loyola. In Scylla and Charybdis, as he tries to set the scene in Shakespeare's London, he thinks of the founder's influential instructions for religious meditation, which begin with a vividly sensory \"composition of place\" and then analyze the images for significance: \"Composition of place. Ignatius Loyola, make haste to help me!\" Later in the chapter, he thinks of the role that another Jesuit played in the Gunpowder Plot to blow up the English Parliament and King in 1606: \"Warwickshire jesuits are tried and we have a porter's theory of equivocation.\" Gifford observes of \"the Warwickshire Jesuit Henry Garnet, provincial of the then-underground order in England,\" that he \"distinguished himself at trial by defending the 'doctrine of equivocation,' that is, maintaining that his attempt to practice deliberate deception on his accusers (i.e., to lie under oath) was perfectly ethical if done 'for the greater Glory of God' (Jesuit motto).\" Shakespeare responded to this ingenious Jesuit reasoning by having the Porter in Macbeth joke about an \"equivocator\" trying unsuccessfully to reason his way into heaven."

  "020060jewmerchants": {
    "note": " \"England is in the hands of the\njews. In all the highest places: her finance, her press. And they are\nthe signs of a nation's decay. Wherever they gather they eat up the\nnation's vital strength\": Deasy repeats the same late 19th century theories about an international Jewish conspiracy that Haines attempted to share with Stephen in Telemachus. But when he goes on to condemn \"jew merchants\" and say that \"They sinned against the light,\" he reverts to Christian ways of hating Jews much older than Wilhelm Marr's newfangled \"anti-Semitism.\"",
    "expandedNote": " The first charge stems ultimately from medieval Christianity's prohibition on lending out money at interest, which created a vacuum that Jews were happy to fill. The second is that the Jews killed Christ, by handing him over to Pontius Pilate and demanding his execution. Both charges are idiotic. To say that the Jews killed Christ overlooks the fact that Christ was a Jew—a fact which Bloom will point out to an enraged Citizen in Cyclops and expound upon to Stephen in Eumaeus. And hating others for supplying an economically essential service that one's own ethnic group has chosen not to practice makes no sense except as an expression of naked financial envy. Mr. Deasy mentions only merchants, not lending money at interest (which became legal in England in 1545), but Stephen answers him with a kind of simple, irrefutable logic that could as easily be applied to the other question: \"A merchant . . . is one who buys cheap and sells dear, jew or gentile, is he not?\"\n Stephen stands up to Deasy here in much the same way that Bloom stands up to the Citizen, and he does so again a moment later on the matter of killing Christ. To Deasy's very theological statement that the Jews sinned against \"the light\" (which John's gospel identifies with The Word, God's begotten Son), he responds unanswerably with the doctrine of Original Sin: \"Who has not?\" In a roundabout way, Oxen of the Sun reinforces Stephen's point. In its final paragraph, when someone asks about Bloom's identity, someone else says, \"Hush! Sinned against the light.\" But earlier in the chapter the narrative has charged all of Ireland with this crime: \"Therefore hast thou sinned against the light and hast made me, thy lord, to be the slave of servants.\""
  },
  "040091jingle": {
    "note": " The word \"jingle,\" in Joyce's prose, generates an extraordinarily dense web of aural associations. In Calypso the \"quoits\" of the Blooms' brass bed sound the word early on when Molly turns over in bed (\"the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled\"), and later when she raises herself on an elbow (\"She set the brasses jingling\"). Their tinkling onomatopoeia resonates throughout the novel, gathering associations with the business that Molly will transact with Blazes Boylan in the bed. In Lestrygonians jingling becomes associated not only with sexual activity but with the harness bells of horses, and in Sirens a jingling horse brings Boylan to his love nest on Eccles Street. Still more associations accrue: the sound of horses' hooves, the strains of a Christmas song, sexual bell-ringing in a foreign language.",
    "expandedNote": "In Penelope Molly recalls that the bed was noisy when she and Boylan were busy: \"this damned old bed too jingling like the dickens I suppose they could hear us away over the other side of the park till I suggested to put the quilt on the floor with the pillow under my bottom.\" The lewd jingling has been anticipated in Circe: after a cuckoo clock calls Bloom a cuckold three times in its monotonous language (\"Cuckoo. / Cuckoo. / Cuckoo\"), \"The brass quoits of a bed are heard to jingle\" the words \"Jigjag. Jigajiga. Jigjag.\" Those jigging sounds go back to Sirens, where they indicate the clap-clop trotting of a horse with different consonants: \"Jog jig jogged stopped. Dandy tan shoe of dandy Boylan socks skyblue clocks came light to earth.\"\n Other \"j\" and \"g\" sounds in Sirens connect the horse motif with the jingling of harness bells and the expression \"jaunting car\": \"Jingle jingle jaunted jingling,\" \"Jingle a tinkle jaunted,\" \"jinglejaunty blazes boy,\" \"Jiggedy jingle jaunty jaunty.\" Jaunting cars were apparently sometimes called jingles, judging by a passage in part 2 of A Portrait of the Artist: \"They drove in a jingle across Cork while it was still early morning.\" Boylan comes to the Ormond Hotel on one of these tinkling, jingling, jaunty urban cabs—their harness bells no doubt mandated by city authorities to promote pedestrian safety, since rubber tires had lowered their sound profile. He keeps the car waiting outside the Ormond, and later in the chapter he travels to Eccles Street on its \"bounding tyres.\"\n Even before Boylan becomes associated with horses' bells and hooves in Sirens, Lestrygonians has insinuated a suggestion that these sounds will be connected with sex. The rich shopping mall of Grafton Street makes Bloom associate horses with men's desire for women and the luxurious things that they buy for them (in his case, most recently, violet garters, which Molly will wear to her assignation with Boylan).\nGrafton street gay with housed awnings lured his senses. Muslin prints, silkdames and dowagers, jingle of harnesses, hoofthuds lowringing in the baking causeway.\n High voices. Sunwarm silk. Jingling harnesses. All for a woman, home and houses, silkwebs, silver, rich fruits spicy from Jaffa. \n Jingling, hoofthuds. Perfumed bodies, warm, full. All kissed, yielded: in deep summer fields, tangled pressed grass, in trickling hallways of tenements, along sofas, creaking beds.\n Evidently the horse bells sounding all around him make Bloom think of his noisy bed back on Eccles Street, and of sex with Molly.\n From Calypso to Lestrygonians (a hop of four chapters), from Lestrygonians to Sirens (three), from Sirens to Circe (four), and fromCirce to Penelope (three), the novel periodically renews this constellation of sounds. It rings most richly in Sirens, where variants of \"jingle\" sound again, and again, and again. A hasty word count turns up at least 53: jingle 18, jingling 3, jingled 2, jing 2, tinkle 1, tinkling 2, tink 2, twinkling 2, jaunting 1, jaunty 4, jaunted 6, jinglejaunty 1, jig 1, jiggedy 3, jog 1, jogged 1, joggled 2, jogjaunty 1. Two or three of these words—tink, twinkling—have no evident conceptual connection to Boylan's horsedrawn journeys, but all of them grow out of the sounds that his cars import into the chapter's musical texture.\n Associating Dublin hackney car bells with New England sleigh bells, Gifford and Seidman hear in this central, generative word \"jingle\" an allusion to the hugely popular Christmas song Jingle Bells, which was composed in 1857 by American songwriter James Lord Pierpont (not his father John, as they say). They note \"particularly the phrases 'Laughing all the way' in the first verse and 'Take the girls tonight' in the third\" (actually the fourth). It seems a plausible claim given the way Sirens associates jingling harness bells with Boylan's insouciant sexual hunger. The annotators neglect the best piece of evidence, however. The second verse is by far the most suggestive:\n A day or two ago\n I thought I'd take a ride,\n And soon Miss Fannie Bright\n Was seated by my side.\n The horse was lean and lank,\n Misfortune seemed his lot,\n He got into a drifted bank\n And we, we got upsot. [variant form of upset]\n Out riding with Miss Fanny (whose name, in Britain and Ireland, carries an obscene suggestion), and all of a sudden pitched into a snowbank with her. Oh jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way! What fun it is to ride!\n If it seems a stretch to suppose that Joyce echoed Jingle Bells in his text and heard sexual thrills in a supposedly family-friendly song, then consider just how far he reaches (Jaysus, James!) to transpose the jingle theme into the new key of a foreign language:\n — No, now, urged Lenehan. Sonnez la cloche! O do! There's no-one. \n She looked. Quick. Miss Kenn out of earshot. Sudden bent. Two kindling faces watched her bend. \n Quavering the chords strayed from the air, found it again, lost chord, and lost and found it, faltering. \n — Go on! Do! Sonnez!\n Bending, she nipped a peak of skirt above her knee. Delayed. Taunted them still, bending, suspending, with wilful eyes. \n — Sonnez!\n Smack. She let free sudden in rebound her nipped elastic garter smackwarm against her smackable a woman's warmhosed thigh. \n — La Cloche! cried gleeful Lenehan. Trained by owner. No sawdust there. \n She smilesmirked supercilious (wept! aren't men?), but, lightward gliding, mild she smiled on Boylan. \n — You're the essence of vulgarity, she in gliding said. \n To Lenehan and Miss Douce \"Sonnez la cloche\" means snapping her garter against her \"woman's warmhosed thigh\"—pretty darn high up the leg for an era that thought it ravishingly sexy to catch a glimpse of socks. The \"smack\" sound at the center of this passage suggests sexual activity at least as vividly as the jingling bed does, but the sounds are remarkably different. The English here draws on all the plosive consonants, unvoiced and voiced, of k/g, t/d, and p/b—quick, kindling, quavering, chords, nipped, peak, taunted, bending, suspending, rebound, nipped, garter, smackwarm, smackable—while the French expression introduces some softer consonants and a warm deep \"o.\" None of them sound remotely like jingling bells or a jogging jaunt. \n But in the case of the French phrase, that is because translation cannot carry over both sound and sense: it must falsify one or the other. The sense of \"Sonnez la cloche,\" Senan Molony points out in a personal communication, is \"Ring the bell.\" \"Sonnez for the thwack of a garter\" is not the best match, he notes, but it translates the sense that Joyce wants, and a later passage in Sirens makes clear that he is weaving it into the same aural web as \"jingle\":\n Jingle by monuments of sir John Gray, Horatio onehandled Nelson, reverend father Theobald Mathew, jaunted, as said before just now. Atrot, in heat, heatseated. Cloche. Sonnez la. Cloche. Sonnez la. Slower the mare went up the hill by the Rotunda, Rutland square.

Open. Slay!"

    "note": " \"Joachim Abbas\" is Joachim of Fiore (1135-1202), a 12th century mystic from Calabria who became abbot of a monastic order (hence \"Abbas\") and who devoted himself to study of the hidden meanings of the Bible, especially those of Revelation. His three manuscripts of apocalyptic philosophy became hugely influential, particularly for their innovative understanding of the divine plan for history. But Stephen has been looking at a later prophetic text falsely attributed to Joachim.",
    "expandedNote": " Joyce probably took the honorific \"Abbas\" from a book he found in Marsh's library, though he could also have encountered it in Dante's Paradiso 12.140. The book that Joyce read in the library was one in a series of manuscripts and printed texts produced from the late 13th century onward, filled with prophecies concerning a series of popes from Pope Nicholas III (in the 1270s) onward. These books had titles like Vaticinia Pontificum (Prophecies of the Popes) or Vaticinia de Summis Pontificibus, and at some point in the 15th century they became attributed to Joachim. \n Joyce apparently connected Joachim with Jonathan Swift (\"Abbas father, furious dean, what offence laid fire to their brains?\") because they are associated in \"The Tables of the Law,\" a story published in 1897 by William Butler Yeats. Thornton notes that Stephen Hero records Stephen's reading of the story, and Gifford observes that the story's protagonist, Owen Aherne, believes in Joachim's prophecies and connects their fervor with Swift's. The relevance of the Yeats story was first noted by Joseph Prescott in \"Notes on Joyce's Ulysses,\" Modern Language Quarterly 13 (1952): 149-62.\n Joachim's \"fading prophecies\" innovated on the linear, teleological understanding of history established early in Christian doctrine, and on the figural aspect of that historiography developed in the Middle Ages, which saw biblical events as \"figures\" or \"types\" predicting later events. For instance, theologians saw the Jews' 40 years of wandering in the wilderness, narrated in Exodus, as prophetically anticipating Christ's 40 days in the desert in Matthew and Luke, in a richly significant patterning scripted by the divine artificer. (Jesus instructs his disciples in these historical predictions of his life at Luke 24:27.) \n Joachim remade this typological historiography in a Trinitarian image. The times represented in the Old Testament (from the Creation until Christ's birth in the year 0) constituted the reign of the Father, when mankind was subject to the divine Law of the Ten Commandments. The times from the New Testament era through Jochim's own (until 1260) constituted the reign of the Son, when human nature was joined with divine nature through faith in Christ and his new law (Love your neighbor as yourself). Future times would fall under the reign of the Holy Spirit, when mankind would have direct contact with God and follow a new law. Each age manifested the divine purpose for humanity more perfectly than the last.\n In the coming age of the Holy Spirit, ecclesiastical hierarchy would disappear, and Christians would find common purpose with Muslims. The mystical meanings of scripture would be understood intuitively, rather than by parsing inferences from the literal sense of the texts. And human beings would, at last, realize the radical freedom and love prophesied in the gospels. It is easy to imagine how Stephen would have been intrigued by this apocalyptic thinking, given his interest in Blake. But Joachim's prophecies seem to be \"fading\" not only on the page, but also in Stephen's hopes, as he comes to terms with the dreary and unimproving course of human history."

    "note": " The Boer War of 1899-1902 aroused intense nationalist emotions all across Ireland. In December 1899 it prompted the worst outbreak of political violence that Dublin had seen in a long time, when a leading British MP named Joseph (\"Joe\") Chamberlain came to town to accept an honorary degree from Trinity College. Protests, counter-protests, and police crackdowns produced a highly volatile atmosphere.",
    "expandedNote": " In Lestrygonians Bloom watches two squads of constables near the \"Trinity railings,\" site of a confrontation between policemen and protesters of Chamberlain's visit that soon moved west to Dublin Castle, and then north across the Grattan Bridge. Bloom recalls being caught up in the violence that erupted at the far end of this turbulent procession, and the angry shouted protests: \"— Up the Boers! / — Three cheers for De Wet! / — We'll hang Joe Chamberlain on a sourapple tree.\" Christiaan de Wet was a general in the citizen army of the Boers who became its foremost practitioner of guerilla warfare. He returns in Circe, as does the reviled Joe Chamberlain.\n Chamberlain had been despised in Ireland since 1886. Ferociously antagonistic to Gladstone's plans for Home Rule, he helped defeat that legislation and resigned from the Liberal Party, causing its government to fall. His new party, the Liberal Unionists, formed an alliance with the Conservatives, and when this bloc came to power in 1895 he was given the office of Secretary of State for the Colonies. Although he had once been outspokenly anti-imperialist, he used his new position to pursue an aggressively militaristic policy toward the Dutch republics in South Africa and effectively directed the war effort from London. At first the war went badly for the British: the towns of Ladysmith, Mafeking, and Kimberly were besieged, and large battles at Stormberg, Magersfontein, and Colenso were lost in the short span that came to be known as Black Week. The Irish, who knew a thing or two about imperial suppression of small republican nations, greeted the dark news with unbridled joy. \n Chamberlain fought opposition to the war with persuasive speeches in Parliament, with personal attacks on Liberal politicians whom he cast as all but traitors, and with a trip to Dublin that many people supposed was designed to show Ireland's support for the war effort. If this was indeed his intention, it was a terrible miscalculation. Even before the start of hostilities Irish nationalists were enlisting to fight on the side of the Boers in a unit called the Irish Transvaal Brigade led by Major John MacBride—one of three Easter Rising leaders executed in 1916 who had fought in South Africa. After returning from South Africa, where he had worked in the Transvaal mines from 1896 to 1898, Arthur Griffith worked to form a political counterpart called the Irish Transvaal Committee, which was housed in an office on Lower Abbey Street that in 1900 birthed Cumann na nGaedheal, the precursor of Sinn Féin. Nationalist leaders affiliated with the ITC, including Griffith, Maud Gonne, Michael Davitt, the young socialist organizer James Connolly (also executed in 1916), and the old Fenian leader John O'Leary planned a pro-Boer protest rally in Beresford Place, not far from Trinity College and site of another pro-Boer demonstration on 1 October 1899 that drew 20,000 people. The authorities planned a massive police response. The resulting turmoil put paid to any notion that the Irish public largely supported the British imperial program.\n In a book titled Forgotten Protest: Ireland and the Anglo-Boer War, 2nd ed. (Ulster Historical Foundation, 2003), the Durban-based historian Donal P. McCracken provides a lively summary of the Chamberlain protest, starting with the effect that news of British military setbacks had on Dubliners: \"The crowds would thrill with excitement and men, radiant with delight, would stop strangers in the street and express their pleasure. Dublin witnessed scenes akin to those which were to take place in London when Mafeking was relieved.\" (Stephen refers in Scylla and Charybdis to the huge \"tide of Mafeking enthusiasm\" released in England when the siege of that town was lifted.) According to the Freeman's Journal, \"In two brief months, the bravery of the little people has destroyed the military prestige of the British Empire, demoralized their troop of enemies, and amazed the world with the spectacle of what men who prefer death to the destruction of their nationality can accomplish\" (53).\n With the news that Chamberlain would be visiting Dublin to receive an honorary degree on Monday, December 18, plans were hatched to hold a protest rally in Beresford Place on Sunday, December 17. On Saturday the authorities in Dublin Castle issued a proclamation banning the gathering. Griffith threw his copy into the fireplace. Hundreds of policemen were deployed on the streets beginning at 11 AM the next day, and a large force of mounted police armed with sabers was assembled in the courtyard of the Castle as a reserve force. At about noon \"a brake, or long car,\" pulled up outside the office of the Irish Transvaal Committee and at least a dozen leaders including O'Leary, Griffith, Gonne, and Connolly got in. Connolly took the reins and \"smashed the brake through a police cordon to get into Beresford Place. The brake was followed by a mass of people waving Boer flags and cheering for the Boers\" (54-55).\n The occupants of the car were briefly arrested, but upon their release from a nearby police station the brake, followed by a huge crowd, crossed the O'Connell Bridge, went up Westmoreland Street, and assembled on College Green outside the \"railings\" of Trinity College—the spot where Bloom thinks in Lestrygonians, \"Right here it began.\" Police attacked with batons drawn, forcing the crowd to move west along Dame Street. After speeches and tauntings of the policemen at points along the way, the crowd came to the end of the street, where, since it seemed lightly guarded, Connolly proposed capturing Dublin Castle. Cooler heads prevailed—fortunately, since hundreds of armed horsemen were still assembled in the courtyard, unseen. The brake and its attendant crowd moved north, down Parliament Street toward the river, followed by the mounted police who had issued from the Castle after they passed. \n When the crowd was across the Grattan Bridge, the officer in charge ordered his men to charge with sabers drawn. \"What followed was one of the most violent scenes Dublin had witnessed in a generation. A pitched battle took place . . . It is said that Arthur Griffith disarmed a mounted policeman. After the initial shock of the first charge—the police used the flats of their swords—the crowds retaliated by throwing whatever they could find. The mounted police were joined by constables on foot, wielding batons. In the confusion the brake escaped along Capel Street and turned into Upper Abbey Street. It is interesting to find that Maud Gonne makes no mention of this riot in her autobiography\" (56). \n Back at the office on Lower Abbey Street, \"a packed and jubilant meeting was held,\" though Davitt was fearful that Joe Chamberlain might be attacked. McCracken concludes, \"The day was a victory for both sides. From the point of view of the authorities, they had stamped on a major threat to their control of the city. It was no accident that Dublin experienced no more pro-Boer demonstrations of this magnitude. The police had shown their determination to stand no nonsense. In the short term, though, the victory was with the Irish Transvaal Committee. Its prestige now soared in the minds of many. It was widely, and most likely correctly, believed that Chamberlain's real motive for visiting Ireland was to 'identify Ireland with the war.' The events of that Sunday afternoon cast strong doubts on the success of such a mission. . . . / In fact Chamberlain's visit was a political and security blunder of the first magnitude . . . no amount of cheering from the undergraduates of Trinity College could disguise the psychological victory which the Irish Transvaal Committee had won\" (56-57).\n In Lestrygonians Bloom recalls running from the mounted police, only to see one of them fall from his horse: \"That horsepoliceman the day Joe Chamberlain was given his degree in Trinity he got a run for his money. My word he did! His horse's hoofs clattering after us down Abbey street. Lucky I had the presence of mind to dive into Manning's or I was souped. He did come a wallop, by George. Must have cracked his skull on the cobblestones.\" This detail, confirmed by contemporary accounts, places Bloom near the climactic battle that engulfed the quays and Capel Street, at a time when citizens were desperately fleeing the mayhem. (Manning's pub was at 41 Upper Abbey Street, on the corner of Liffey Street.) Had he wandered west from the newspaper offices near O'Connell Street, or did he join the protest somewhere on its route from Trinity College to Capel Street?\n Wherever his involvement started, it seems that an accidental encounter with some TCD students brought it about: \"I oughtn't to have got myself swept along with those medicals. And the Trinity jibs in their mortarboards. Looking for trouble. Still I got to know young Dixon.\" Joyce modeled \"young Dixon\" on a real-life Joseph F. Dixon who received a medical degree from TCD in December 1904, so presumably the other \"medicals\" Bloom thinks of were also attending that Protestant ruling-class institution. Slote, relying on Patridge's dictionary of slang, identifies \"jibs\" as first-year undergraduates. It is almost inconceivable that any Trinity students, much less freshmen, would have been demonstrating against Chamberlain. There are no contemporary accounts of them doing so, and it is well known that some did mount pro-Chamberlain rallies, so the students with whom Bloom got \"swept along\" must have been \"Looking for trouble\" in the form of violent confrontations with the mostly Catholic nationalists. \n However Bloom may have come to be swept up in the chaos, the way he praises the great many Irishmen who fought in the British armed forces when accosted by two policemen in Circe suggests that he feels defensive about having held pro-Boer, anti-Chamberlain views. Bloom tells the constables that his father-in-law fought in \"the heroic defense of Rorke's drift,\" an 1879 action in Zululand, but his sycophancy is met with an anonymous jeer: \"Turncoat! Up the Boers! Who booed Joe Chamberlain?\" In reply, he makes himself a veteran of the Boer War: \"I'm as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under general Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was mentioned in dispatches.\" Sir Hubert Gough helped lift the siege of Ladysmith in February 1900. Spion Kop was the site of a Boer victory in January 1900. Bloemfontein, the capital of the Orange Free State, fell to the British in March 1900. \n Erected in 1907, the notorious Fusiliers' Arch that guards the Grafton Street entrance to St. Stephen's Green embodies the contrary emotions expressed in Bloom's defensive rant to the constables. It commemorates the courage and sacrifice of four battalions of Royal Dublin Fusiliers in the Second Boer War, with inscriptions recording the major battles in which the Fusiliers took part and the names of the 222 men who died. Nationalists, however, quickly bestowed a new name on it: Traitors' Gate, the water entrance through which political prisoners were long ferried into the Tower of London. Remarkably, this triumphal arch remains, in McCracken's words, \"one of the few British-erected monuments in Dublin which have not been blown up\" (148)."

    "note": " In Eumaeus Bloom mistakenly attributes the poem Caoch O'Leary to \"poor John Casey.\" He has confused the author, John Keegan, with John Keegan Casey, the \"Poet of the Fenians\" who wrote The Rising of the Moon, the well-known song about the Rebellion of 1798. Both men died young, but Casey especially deserves to be called \"poor\": incarceration after the Fenian Rising in 1867 destroyed his health, and he died at age 23.",
    "expandedNote": " The son of a school teacher, Casey was born near Mullingar in County Westmeath in August 1846, at the height of the great famine. He lived through years of overwhelming anguish: mass starvation and disease, mass evictions of peasants from their cottages, mass emigration in the \"coffin ships,\" criminal government neglect, more radical and militant forms of nationalism, harsh crackdowns by the state authorities. As a teenager he began writing nationalistic ballads like The Patriot's Love, The Reaper of Glenree, The Forging of the Pikes, Máire My Girl, and The Rising of the Moon. Many were sung at political gatherings, and their popularity led Casey to move to Dublin, where he joined the Fenian movement and wrote articles for The Nation under the pen-name \"Leo.\" His collected poems, published as A Wreath of Shamrocks in 1866, brought him still more fame, and he spoke at mass rallies in Dublin, Liverpool, and London.\n After the suppression of the Fenian rebellion, Casey was imprisoned without charges in Mountjoy Prison for eight months. Released because of poor health on condition that he self-transport to Australia, he stayed in Dublin in disguise, married, and had a child, but the baby died in October 1869 and Casey himself did a few months later, on St. Patrick's Day, 1870. Newspapers estimated that more than 50,000 people followed his casket to the Glasnevin cemetery on foot, and another 50,000 to 100,000 lined the streets to see it pass by. Fifteen years later, a monumental Celtic cross was erected over his grave. \n Almost anyone might be forgiven for mixing up Keegan and Casey, two relatively obscure 19th century poets from the Irish Midlands who had similar names and both died young. But is Bloom the culprit, or Joyce? If it's Bloom, the error is entirely consistent with all his other close-but-not-quite stabs at remembering obscure information, including his confusion of Thomas Gray and Thomas Campbell in Hades, when he tries to recall who wrote Elegy in a Country Churchyard. Rather than scorn Bloom for his defective mnemotechnic, a kindhearted reader might admire this largely self-educated man for the range of what he does know, and sympathize with his inability to get everything right."

    "note": " Nosey Flynn's conspiratorial gossip about Bloom in Lestrygonians includes a recent sighting: \"I met him the day before yesterday and he coming out of that Irish farm dairy John Wyse Nolan's wife has in Henry street with a jar of cream in his hand taking it home to his better half.\" The John Wyse Nolan of Ulysses is based on a real person, John Wyse Power, whose wife Jennie owned and ran a food business at 21 Henry Street. Both spouses were ardent nationalists, and in April 1916 seven members of the Irish Republican Brotherhood met in Jennie Power's establishment to sign the Proclamation of independence whose public reading several days later initiated the Easter Rising. It is quite possible that Bloom does more than purchase dairy products on Henry Street.",
    "expandedNote": " Jane or Jennie O'Toole was born into a staunchly nationalist family in Baltinglass, County Wicklow in 1858 and grew up in Dublin. She admired Charles Stewart Parnell, and in 1881 she became active in the Ladies' Land League that was agitating for the rights of Ireland's tenant farmers. In 1899 she founded the Irish Farm Produce Company, which ran a dairy products shop, and, on the same premises, a restaurant with tea and lunch rooms specializing in vegetarian dishes. Advanced nationalists—Arthur Griffith, John MacBride, Constance Markievicz, Seán O'Kelly, Thomas MacDonagh, and doubtless many others—met regularly at her house in Henry Street, and it was under regular surveillance by government undercover agents. \n Jennie Power, as she was known after her marriage in 1883 (she winningly left out the Wyse, telling people she had no wisdom), was also a passionate feminist and suffragist, and a passionate advocate of buying Irish agricultural and manufacturing products. In the early 1900s she took on central roles in both Sinn Féin and Inghinidhe na hÉireann, or Daughters of Ireland, a nationalist women's organization founded by Maud Gonne. In 1914 she helped subsume the latter group into Cumann na mBan, The Women's Council, and then led this republican paramilitary adjunct to the Irish Volunteers, over 100 of whose members were imprisoned after the Rising. After the establishment of the Irish Free State, she was one of four women nominated to the Senate, where she continued to serve until 1936. Like Joyce, she died in January 1941. She is buried in Prospect Cemetery.\n Jennie Power's political activities might seem to bear little relevance to Bloom buying a jar of cream in the IFPC, but her shop is nearly a mile from his home, and the context in which his action is disclosed invites scrutiny of his motives. Everything that the aptly named Nosey Flynn says about Bloom comes with an air of suspicious distrust. Here, at the beginning of his exchange with Davy Byrne, he has not yet made any anti-Jewish or anti-Masonic insinuations; he only defames Molly for being plump (\"She's well nourished, I tell you. Plovers on toast\") and her husband for solicitously seeing to her needs and somehow being able to afford expensive groceries (\"He doesn't buy cream on the ads he picks up. You can make bacon of that\"). But he mentions Bloom \"coming out of that Irish farm dairy\" as if he perhaps caught him in something illicit. \n Given the climate of clandestine observation, paranoid secrecy, and omnidirectional suspicion that attended militant nationalism in 1904, Bloom's emergence from a well-known fenian redoubt might well be remarked upon as possibly surreptitious. And there the matter would rest, in the realm of faint possibility, were it not for another report about Bloom from another pub-dweller several chapters later. Cyclops presents the seemingly outlandish revelation that Bloom may have something to do with Sinn Féin, and the source, amazingly, is none other than Jennie Nolan's husband: \"John Wyse saying it was Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper all kinds of jerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the taxes off of the Government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk about selling Irish industries.\" \n This sentence raises questions of tone and substance. Does John Wyse Nolan, whose voice is not heard directly, present Bloom's initiative sympathetically or derisively? Does he list the specific \"ideas\" that Bloom has suggested to Griffith, or does the unnamed narrator of the chapter infer nefarious and improbable things like gerrymandering, packed juries, and tax evasion? In the militantly nationalistic atmosphere of Barney Kiernan's pub it seems unlikely that an association with Sinn Féin would be seen as reprehensible, and the goal of promoting Irish industries abroad is entirely consistent with the program of economic decolonialization advanced by Jennie Power. Perhaps the best way of resolving the contradictions here is to assume that Wyse Nolan has been favorably impressed by Bloom's involvement in fenian politics—and that the misanthropic narrator has found a way to turn even that into an indictment.\n However one may respond to this puzzling sentence, the basic claim made by Wyse Nolan seems credible. Arthur Griffith was frequently to be found at the IFPC. Jennie Power worked closely with him, and became an important officer of Sinn Féin. Bloom admires Griffith, and pays attention to what his newspaper, the United Irishman, is saying. Bloom knows newspapers and thinks throughout the day about how they get messages across. And Sinn Féin, in 1904, was a considerably less radical organization than it became by 1916. It is by no means inconceivable that the cautious, prudent Bloom could have advanced ideas for Irish independence to Arthur Griffith in Henry Street. \n Why, if so, reflections on these matters would never cross Bloom's mind on June 16 is another mystery. Perhaps the Irish habit of evading spies and informers has become so ingrained in him that he does not even allow himself to spend much time thinking dangerous thoughts. He thinks elsewhere in Lestrygonians, \"Never know who you're talking to. . . . Egging raw youths on to get in the know all the time drawing secret service pay from the castle. . . . James Stephens' idea was the best. He knew them. Circles of ten so that a fellow couldn't round on more than his own ring. Back out you get the knife. Hidden hand.\" Whatever the reasons may be for Bloom not thinking about his ideas for Sinn Féin on June 16, it would be entirely in character for him to purchase some cream, conspicuously displayed \"in his hand,\" to cover his visits to a known hotbed of republican activists.\n Thanks to Vincent Altman O'Connor for getting me thinking about the political affliliations of \"John Wyse Nolan's wife\" and her shop on Henry Street."

    "note": " What Stephen calls \"The ballad of joking Jesus\" is an only slightly retouched excerpt of a poem written by Oliver Gogarty, called The Song of the Cheerful (but slightly sarcastic) Jesus. Joyce's small revisions make the poem still funnier.",
    "expandedNote": " Gogarty apparently wrote his poem only after Joyce had moved out of the tower. He sent it to Joyce for Christmas 1904, and Ellmann speculates that his gift was meant as a peace offering after their fall break-up. Joyce reciprocated the sentiment, it would seem, when he took parts of this satirical poem and put them in Mulligan's mouth on the morning of June 16, forming the comical high point of Telemachus. Ellmann reproduces Gogarty's poem in its entirety (206), making it easy to judge how Joyce presented it. \n In Telemachus, Mulligan recites stanzas 1, 2, and 9 of the poem’s nine quatrains, the last of these being somewhat revised from the original. Of these editorial choices, it may be said that Joyce represented Gogarty at his best. Stanzas 1, 2, and 9 are by far the funniest, and where 9 is uninspired (“Goodbye, now, goodbye, you are sure to be fed / You will come on My Grave when I rise from the dead”) Joyce did a very creditable job of improving it (“Goodbye, now, goodbye. Write down all I said / And tell Tom, Dick and Harry I rose from the dead”). \n He also identified two good lines in stanza 3 and, rather than leave them out, found an occasion to use them later in the book. In Circe, King Edward VII appears “in the garb and with the halo of Joking Jesus” and speaks these lines verbatim: “My methods are new and are causing surprise. To make the blind see I throw dust in their eyes.”\n Gogarty published six books of poetry later in his life, including exactly none of his bawdy and irreverent verses like Jesus. He gained some repute as a great poet, mostly undeserved, when W. B. Yeats selected a large number of his lyrics for the Oxford Book of Modern Verse 1892-1935 (1936) and gave him high praise in the introduction. Jesus displays real comic genius but is markedly uneven; in editing it for inclusion in Ulysses, Joyce displays a greater gift, or at least a Creative Writing professor’s better judgment when confronting uneven student work."

Both Stephen, in Proteus, and the Citizen, in Cyclops, recall meeting him there.",
    "expandedNote": " Joseph Theobald Casey, born in Kilkenny in 1846, was a cousin and godson to James Stephens, who founded the Irish Republican Brotherhood in 1858. He was arrested for alleged involvement in the attack on the police van in Manchester in September 1867, and imprisoned in London's high-security Clerkenwell Prison. In December 1867 a plot to free him and other Fenians by blowing up a wall of the prison failed. \n In a subsequent trial, Casey was acquitted of the charges against him. He moved to Paris, and eventually he took a job as a typesetter (\"fingers smeared with printer's ink\") for the New York Herald, which opened a press in that city in 1877. As the young James Joyce prepared to move to Paris in 1902, he wrote to Lady Gregory about his plans, mentioning that \"I know of a man who used to live somewhere near Montmartre but I have never met him\" (Ellmann 107). He met that man, Casey, on several occasions in 1902 and 1903, and became familiar with his life: \"Making his day's stations, the dingy printingcase, his three taverns, the Montmartre lair he sleeps short night in.\" Both Joseph and his son Patrice lent the impoverished Joyce small amounts of money. The James Joyce Centre's website, jamesjoyce.ie, notes that on 17 March 1903 Joyce sent his mother a postcard, complaining that no one at home had sent him a shamrock to commemorate St. Patrick's Day, but mentioning that Joseph Casey had given him some. Casey died in Paris in 1907. \n Ellmann notes that Joyce and Casey would meet for lunch at the Restaurant des Deux-Écus near the Herald building (125), and it seems to be this setting that Stephen recalls when he thinks of Kevin Egan sipping his absinthe while \"About us gobblers fork spiced beans down their gullets.\" The narrative also preserves the memory of Casey's son Patrice, who served as a soldier in the French army (\"Mon fils, soldier of France\"), and of his estrangement from his wife: \"She is quite nicey comfy without her outcast man, madame in rue Git-le-Coeur, canary and two buck lodgers. Peachy cheeks, a zebra skirt, frisky as a young thing's.\" \n The three long paragraphs devoted to Stephen's memories of his conversations with Kevin Egan give a pitying account: \"Weak wasting hand on mine. They have forgotten Kevin Egan, not he them.\" The aging man with \"Raw facebones under his peep of day boy's hat\" wants Stephen to know that he once cut a fine figure: \"I was a strapping young gossoon at that time, I tell you. I'll show you my likeness one day. I was, faith.\" He wants to relive the glory days of his youth and talk about current hopes for independence, but Stephen resists an appeal that sounds to him like cooptation: \"To yoke me as his yokefellow, our crimes our common cause.\" Stephen thinks that he lives in a vanished world \"Of lost leaders, the betrayed, wild escapes. Disguises, clutched at, gone, not here.\" Like the follies of his own youth, and the disorder of his uncle's house, and the rotting remnants of things strewn about the tide flats, Egan's life registers in his consciousness as an emblem of ruinous protean flux.\n Nevertheless, Joyce sought out this man in Paris, and Stephen seems not only to have spent some considerable time with Egan, but also to have formed some sense of personal connection. Later in Proteus, stretching his frame back across some rocks, and nudging his hat down over his eyes against the sun, he thinks, \"That is Kevin Egan's movement I made, nodding for his nap, sabbath sleep.\""

The word came into English at about the time of Shakespeare's play, according to the OED, meaning either a fancy cookery dish (\"with contemptuous force\"), or \"something dainty or elegant, but insubstantial or comparatively valueless.\" Such elegant but trivial French inventions, encountered not only on the dinner table but on the stage as well, elicit disdain from right-thinking Englishmen. \n \"Yellow stockings,\" cross-gartered, are another such pretentious innovation, despised by the no-nonsense Lady Olivia but unfortunately adopted by her steward, Malvolio, in a misguided attempt to win her favor. In the context of Stephen's thoughts, they imply sexual unattractiveness—an exotic anaphrodisiac to accompany the more mundane \"lumpy wool\" and \"those curse of God stays suspenders,\" a corset with garters that invites God's curse, Gifford supposes, because it may function as a chastity belt. As Maria says to Sir Toby, relishing her brilliant joke, \"He will come to her in yellow stockings, and ’tis a color she abhors, and cross-gartered, a fashion she detests\" (2.5). \n Putting these pieces together, one may assume that the literary Stephen is finding reasons to second-guess his attraction to the virgin at the window, by despising her upper-class affectations. Bloom will experience a similar moment of distaste when he sees a young woman chatting up George Russell: \"Her stockings are loose over her ankles. I detest that: so tasteless. Those literary etherial people they are all. Dreamy, cloudy, symbolistic. Esthetes they are.\""

  "030019kidneysofwheat": {
    "note": " In Proteus Stephen thinks of priests \"moving burly in their albs, tonsured and oiled and gelded, fat with the fat of kidneys of wheat.\" The last phrase alludes to a passage in the Bible, but its effect is to satirize the hypocrisy of priests, eating well while they promote poverty among their parishioners. The image of burly, fat, oily priests coheres with a strain of anti-clericalism that runs through Joyce's works.",
    "expandedNote": " In Deuteronomy, Moses sings of the blessings that God bestowed on Jacob and his people Israel: \"He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock; Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape\" (32:13-14). Thornton credits Ulrich Schneider with having first spotted the biblical allusion in Proteus.\n In the Christmas dinner scene of A Portrait of the Artist, Mr. Casey speaks scornfully of the \"Princes of the church,\" and Simon Dedalus chips in with a caricature of Michael Logue, at the time the archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland (he was made a cardinal in 1893): \"—Tub of guts, said Mr Dedalus coarsely. He has a handsome face, mind you, in repose. You should see that fellow lapping up his bacon and cabbage of a cold winter's day. O Johnny! / He twisted his features into a grimace of heavy bestiality and made a lapping noise with his lips.\" \n Leopold Bloom has similar thoughts in Lestrygonians, when he sees one of Dedalus' countless daughters: \"Fifteen children he had. Birth every year almost. That's in their theology or the priest won't give the poor woman the confession, the absolution. Increase and multiply. Did you ever hear such an idea? Eat you out of house and home. No families themselves to feed. Living on the fat of the land. Their butteries and larders. I'd like to see them do the black fast Yom Kippur. Crossbuns. One meal and a collation for fear he'd collapse on the altar.\"\n In Oxen of the Sun kidneys of wheat, with the aid of yeast, make the mash that produces ale: \"it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of Chaldee that by aid of certain angry spirits that they do into it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountain.\""

  "040009kidneys": {
    "note": " The opening sentences of Calypso describe a man who is considerably more at home in his body than is Stephen Dedalus, and considerably less brilliant with language. The first sentence contains an apparently unintended pun, \"ate with relish,\" and then, as if to confirm that something is not quite right, the second paragraph begins with a supremely awkward literalism: \"Kidneys were in his mind.\" These locutions can be read as instances of free indirect style, pulling the prose into the mental orbit of Bloom, much as the narration on the first page of the novel swung into the orbits first of Mulligan and then of Stephen.",
    "expandedNote": " § The clownish ineptitude of these stylistic features notwithstanding, the chapter's opening moves the novel quite decisively, and skillfully, from Stephen's rarified intellectual meanderings to Bloom's intestinal hankerings. The effect of hearing Bloom's list of organ meats is similar to the transition that Joyce makes at the beginning of part 3 inA Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man: \"The swift December dusk had come clownishly after its dull day and, as he stared through the dull square of the window of the schoolroom, he felt his belly crave for its food. He hoped there would be stew for dinner, turnips and carrots and bruised potatoes and fat mutton pieces to be ladeled out in thick peppered flourfattened sauce. Stuff it into you, his belly counseled him.\" \n These sentences derive much of their impact from their contrast with the ending of part 2. As Stephen kisses a prostitute for the first time, bodies dissolve into abstractions: \"With a sudden movement she bowed his head and joined her lips to his and he read the meaning of her movements in her frank uplifted eyes. It was too much for him. He closed his eyes, surrendering himself to her, body and mind, conscious of nothing in the world but the dark pressure of her softly parting lips. They pressed upon his brain as upon his lips as though they were the vehicle of a vague speech; and between them he felt an unknown and timid pressure, darker than the swoon of sin, softer than sound or odour.\" Amorous lips press upon the brain with an unknown language, and a wet tongue becomes transmogrified into something even more vague than \"the swoon of sin.\" \n Bloom's narrative takes over from Stephen's in Ulysses with a catalogue of bodily organs—\"thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart, liverslices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencods' roes,\" \"grilled mutton kidneys\"—not as a humiliating reminder of the spirit's enslavement to carnal sin (Stephen's condition inA Portrait), but as a lusty hymn to carnal appetite. Joyce's schemas do not assign an organ to any of the first three chapters, because Stephen barely resides in his body. Calypso is associated with an organ: the \"kidney.\""

  "050042kildareclub": {
    "note": " At the turn of the century the \"Kildare street club\" was Dublin's most exclusive men's club, catering to the Anglo-Irish gentry in a striking building just south of Trinity College. Dress was important: Bloom thinks in Circe of a \"Kildare street club toff,\" and Tom Kernan proudly supposes that his splendid second-hand topcoat may once have turned heads there: \"Some Kildare street club toff had it probably.\" (\"Toff,\" according to the OED, is \"An appellation given by the lower classes to a person who is stylishly dressed or who has a smart appearance; a swell; hence, one of the well-to-do, a 'nob'.\")",
    "expandedNote": " Founded in 1782 for males of the Ascendancy class, the Club originally occupied a house on Kildare Street, and then two houses, but by the 1850s it was doing so well that more space was needed, and three houses on Kildare and Leinster Streets were demolished to make space for a grand new L-shaped structure. This new building, designed by Benjamin Woodward and Thomas Newenham Deane, the architect who designed the National Library and National Museum, opened in 1860. It featured highly distinctive arched windows with pairs of slender columns between them, and \"whimsical beasts\" carved around the bases of the columns. These animals are often said to have been carved by the O'Shea brothers, but Robert Nicholson attributes the work to C. W. Harrison (Ulysses Guide, 176).\n Perhaps the animals were playing in George Moore's mind when he composed an unforgettable portrait of the club in the first chapter of Parnell and His Island (1877):\n The Kildare Street Club is one of the most important institutions in Dublin. It represents in the most complete acceptation of the word the rent party in Ireland; better still, it represents all that is respectable, that is to say, those who are gifted with an oyster-like capacity for understanding this one thing: that they should continue to get fat in the bed in which they were born. This club is a sort of oyster-bed into which all the eldest sons of the landed gentry fall as a matter of course. There they remain spending their days, drinking sherry and cursing Gladstone in a sort of dialect, a dead language which the larva-like stupidity of the club has preserved. The green banners of the League are passing, the cries of a new Ireland awaken the dormant air, the oysters rush to their window—they stand there open-mouthed, real pantomime oysters, and from the corner of Frederick Street a group of young girls watch them in silent admiration.\n The Club had its own cricket ground, billiard rooms, card-playing rooms, reading rooms, and drinking rooms. In his notes for Dubliners and A Portrait of the Artist, Gifford quotes one member to the effect that it was \"the only place in Ireland where one can enjoy decent caviar.\" \n Independence in 1922 spelled the end of the club's growth and the beginning of its slow decline. It eventually merged with the Dublin University Club and moved to new premises on the north side of St. Stephen's Green. The building on Kildare Street still stands, but it is now used by other organizations, particularly the Alliance Française."

  "010007kinch": {
    "note": " As Mulligan affirms soon after calling down the stairs for \"Kinch,\" he is the source of this nickname for Stephen: “my name for you is the best: Kinch, the knife-blade.” Ellmann says that Oliver Gogarty gave the name to Joyce and remarks that it imitated “the cutting sound of a knife” (131). This seems pretty obscure, but Mulligan's explanation certainly justifies hearing some sort of association with knives in the word. Other meanings of \"kinch\" may be worth exploring, not as alternatives but as complements.",
    "expandedNote": " Mulligan uses his nickname for Stephen relentlessly: eighteen times in Telemachus (to only six or seven instances of calling him \"Dedalus\"), another five in Scylla and Charybdis, and once in Oxen of the Sun. Stephen appears to have accepted the sobriquet willingly enough. When he is playing whimsically with the thought of navelcords in Proteus he thinks, \"Hello. Kinch here. Put me on to Edenville,\" and at the end of the chapter he mocks himself as \"Toothless Kinch, the superman.\" Paying Bella Cohen in the brothel, he generously includes Lynch and Bloom: \"We are all in the same sweepstake, Kinch and Lynch.\" \n If Kinch primarily suggests the sharpness of a blade, that association coheres with the many knife images in Telemachus that paint the relationship between Mulligan and Stephen as hostile and potentially violent: Mulligan’s razor; the knife on which, “impaled,” he thrusts slices of bread toward Stephen and Haines; the doctor's “lancet” and the writer's “cold steelpen.\" One effect of all these sharpened blades is to liken the Martello fortification to Elsinore castle, where hiding behind an arras or accepting a fencing invitation can prove fatal, and to the palace of Ithaca, where a host of suitors is slaughtered to the last man and the floors run ankle-deep in blood. \n But there may be other associations lurking within the word. In a personal communication, Senan Molony proposes considering the expression \"kinchin lay,\" which refers to stealing money from children. In Dickens' Oliver Twist, Noah asks Fagin to recommend a risk-free form of stealing and rejects his idea of snatching bags and parcels from old ladies (too noisy, may scratch). Fagin thinks some more and suggests the kinchin lay: \"'The kinchins, my dear,' said Fagin, 'is the young children that's sent on errands by their mothers, with sixpences and shillings; and the lay is just to take their money away—they've always got it ready in their hands—then knock 'em into the kennel, and walk off very slow, as if there were nothing else the matter but a child fallen down and hurt itself. Ha! ha! ha!'\"\n If this expression has figured in Mulligan's creative process, his nickname implies that Stephen is not only a sharp-witted writer with a penchant for literary assassination, but also a sponger who supports himself by lifting money off of easy marks. And that too would fit the relationship of the two young men. Stephen has borrowed money and goods lavishly from Mulligan, as from various other acquaintances, and Mulligan shames him for eating all of the food that he has provided at no expense—a role that allies him with Joyce's mother, who sent postal orders whenever she could to relieve the son who was going days at a time without food in Paris. Eumaeus finds one more solicitous person, Bloom, offering food to this young man who says that he hasn't eaten for two days.\n Mulligan mentions the knife association, Molony observes, just after remarking that Haines is \"Bursting with money and indigestion,\" a fact which may prompt his reflection that Stephen is the intellectual equal of the Oxfordian but lacks his financial means and should go to Haines and \"touch him for a guinea.\" This action of teasing out money, he notes, is not unrelated to knife-blades, because in Aeolus Stephen imagines the two old virgins from the Liberties putting one to similar use: \"They save up three and tenpence in a red tin letterbox moneybox. They shake out the threepenny bits and a sixpence and coax out the pennies with the blade of a knife. Two and three in silver and one and seven in coppers.\" In fact, Mulligan seems to associate cadging money with a whole range of cutlery: \"We must go to Athens. Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid?\" This is all fantastically associative, but perhaps not beyond the reach of what Frank O'Connor memorably called Joyce's \"associative mania.\""

    "note": " \"Where the foreleg of King Billy's horse pawed the air Mrs Breen plucked her hastening husband back from under the hoofs of the outriders\": Dennis Breen's heedless half-mad pursuit of justice in Wandering Rocks nearly reduces him to roadkill under the hooves of the viceregal cavalcade. Close by, a statue of King William III celebrates the reduction of Catholic Ireland to roadkill in 1690.",
    "expandedNote": " Joyce's prose contrives to crush the Catholic Breen between the living horses pulling the carriages of Ireland's English governors and the bronze one carrying its most decisive English conqueror. The Dutch prince William of Orange invaded England to assist in the deposition of King James II, whose Catholic sympathies had alarmed the Protestant majority of that nation, and as the newly crowned King of England he invaded Ireland to pursue the fleeing James. The victory of \"King Billy,\" as many Scots and Ulster Protestants call him, over James at the Battle of the Boyne near Drogheda ushered in the Protestant Ascendancy, the penal laws, and the systematic colonial subjugation of Irish Catholics. \n William's \"immortal memory\" was celebrated in Dublin with an equestrian statue at the busy College Green intersection across from Trinity College. Gifford wryly summarizes the esteem in which it was held by Catholics: \"He is remembered only a little more cordially than Cromwell as a great oppressor. The emphasis on the horse in this passage recalls a traditional Irish toast: 'To the memory of the chestnut horse [that broke the neck of William of Orange].' (It was actually his collarbone, but that and a chill were the death of him.) The controversial statue was removed after an encounter with a land mine in 1929.\"\n Joyce had already once used this statue to symbolize the paralyzing subjection of life in a colonial city. In The Dead, Gabriel Conroy gracefully tells the story of his grandfather's horse Johnny, who spent his days walking round and round to turn the wheel in Patrick Morkan's starch mill. And \"That was all very well; but now comes the tragic part about Johnny. One fine day the old gentleman thought he'd like to drive out with the quality to a military review in the park.\" Like the Dubliners bowing and scraping before the viceregal carriage in Wandering Rocks, Morkan puts on his best attire for \"the quality\" at the military review, and harnesses his old horse to his carriage. \n \"And everything went on beautifully until Johnny came in sight of King Billy's statue: and whether he fell in love with the horse King Billy sits on or whether he thought he was back again in the mill, anyhow he began to walk round the statue,\" over and over in his accustomed pointless repetition. The \"tragic part\" of Gabriel's funny story is that Irish men and women revolve in the same soul-killing orbit.\n Stephen has associated fine horses with English nobility and Irish Ascendancy gentry in Nestor. Bloom too has his thoughts about the horsey set in Lotus Eaters, Lestrygonians, and Circe."

    "note": " The monarch on the British throne in 1904 was King Edward VII, known before Queen Victoria's death in 1901 as Albert Edward, Prince of Wales. Predictably, he comes in for less than reverential treatment in Ulysses. The dissolute ways of the prince are mocked in Cyclops, and in Circethe hallucinated figure of the king steps in to oversee the fight that occurs when two soldiers hear Stephen say, \"in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.\"",
    "expandedNote": " Mr. Deasy's mantelpiece in Nestor boasts a picture of \"the shapely bulk of a man in tartan filibegs: Albert Edward, prince of Wales.\" The portrait is recent enough that Dirty Bertie, as he was sometimes called, has assumed his distinctive \"bulk.\" Over time, the man's waistline came to match his gargantuan appetites for food, drink, smoking, gambling, and sex. Edward was also a fancier of thoroughbred horses and an habitué of the racetrack, a fact which may well explain Deasy's having coupled \"the princely presence\" with portraits of \"vanished horses.\"\n In Cyclops, J. J. O'Molloy observes that \"we have Edward the peacemaker now,\" referring to the king's efforts to establish peaceful relations with some of his European neighbors. Gifford notes that this is \"What the French called Edward VII in the first blush of optimism about the entente cordiale. It was also a title that he coveted.\" In reply, the Citizen blusteringly alludes to the prince's notorious sexual exploits: \"Tell that to a fool. . . . There's a bloody sight more pox than pax about that boyo.\" Joe Hynes sneers at \"the priests and bishops of Ireland doing up his room in Maynooth in His Satanic Majesty's racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his jockeys rode,\" to which Alf Bergan replies, \"They ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself.\" J. J. wryly assures him that \"Considerations of space influenced their lordships' decision.\" \n The Citizen also takes aim at Edward's German origins, calling him \"Edward Guelph-Wettin.\" Guelph, Gifford notes, was the family name of the House of Hanover, and \"Wettin is the Prussian version of the Swedish Wetter, Prince Albert's family name. Queen Victoria dropped the name Guelph when she married Prince Albert.\" In 1849, at the tender age of 8, their son Albert Edward was created \"earl of Dublin\" during his mother's state visit to Dublin—a fact which likewise draws the Citizen's scorn.\n In Circe, the looming presence of two aggressive British soldiers brings King Edward into the drama, via Stephen's thoughts: \"(With elaborate gestures, breathing deeply and slowly.) You are my guests. Uninvited. By virtue of the fifth of George and seventh of Edward. History to blame.\" George V, Edward's successor, was crowned King after his father's death in 1910. Stephen's wish to cleanse his mind of the imperial presence—\"(He taps his brow.) But in here it is I must kill the priest and the king\"—excites the soldiers' wrath. It also makes the king spring to life: \"Edward the Seventh appears in an archway.\" He has come to oversee the fight."

It connects Dublin by train with western and southern parts of Ireland, and in late 1893 James Joyce (then 11) made a trip to Cork with his father, leaving from Kingsbridge Station.",
    "expandedNote": " After King George IV paid a visit to Ireland in 1821, a bridge was built across the Liffey to commemorate the event. In 1846 the Great Southern and Western Railway built a striking new train station nearby, designed in an Italianate style by English architect Sancton Wood. It came to be called by the name of the bridge. In 1966, fifty years after the Easter Rising, the station was renamed after Seán Heuston, one of the sixteen leaders executed by the British authorities. Heuston had been employed by the railroad, had worked in the offices of the station, and had commanded a detachment of soldiers nearby during the Rising.\n In the second part of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, Stephen is seen \"seated beside his father in the corner of a railway carriage at Kingsbridge. He was traveling with his father by the night train to Cork\" (91-92). The purpose of the trip is to sell some family properties in that city, where John Joyce was born, in order to pay back a moneylender to whom he was deeply in debt. Joyce made a point of remembering the name of that moneylender, Reuben J. Dodd, in Ulysses.\n In Wandering Rocks the viceregal cavalcade leaves Phoenix Park by the lower gate and \"proceeded past Kingsbridge along the northern quays.\" Whether the reference is to the bridge or to the station is really a distinction without a difference, as the last photograph displayed here may illustrate."

  "010037harbourmouth": {
    "note": " Atop the Martello tower in Telemachus, Stephen looks northwest to where a ship is leaving \"the harbourmouth of Kingstown.\" The suburb of Kingstown, today called Dún Laoghaire (Dunleary), lies several miles southeast of Dublin very near Sandycove, the rocky point where the tower is sited. Two granite walls, referred to as the \"pier\" in Telemachus and Nestor, project out into Dublin Bay from Kingstown, forming a large artificial harbor.",
    "expandedNote": " In the second decade of the 19th century work began on creating a harbor at the coastal town of Dún Laoghaire by erecting two immense walls called the East and West Piers. The town was later renamed Kingstown to honor an 1821 visit by King George IV in his yacht. After independence its Irish name was restored. The western pier is nearly a mile long, and together the two walls enclose an area of about 250 acres, with water depths from 15 to 27 feet. It is one of the world's best manmade harbors.\n In Telemachus a young man swimming in the Fortyfoot tells Mulligan that he has seen a friend of theirs hanging out with a girl \"on the pier.\" In Nestor, Armstrong refers to \"Kingstown pier,\" and when Stephen asks him what he knows about Pyrrhus, the boy can only think of a silly pun: \"Pyrrhus, sir? Pyrrhus, a pier.\" The heavy use of the East Pier by people enjoying themselves (walkers, musicians, lovers, yachters, children at play) poses quite a contrast to the dismal story of Pyrrhus. Armstrong indeed does not \"know anything about Pyrrhus,\" and has other things on his mind."

    "expandedNote": " In Proteus Stephen asks himself, \"Here, I am not walking out to the Kish lightship, am I?\" InNausicaa, Bloom reclines on the same Sandymount beach and sees a light far out on the waves: \"And far on Kish bank the anchored lightship twinkled, winked at Mr Bloom.\" Such lightships (still to be found in Ireland and the UK) warned pilots of navigation hazards at sites where it would be impossible or prohibitively expensive to build a lighthouse. They had large letters on their sides, announcing not the name of the vessel but its location. A stout mast or superstructure supported a single light high enough off the water to be visible from passing ships. \n Men were needed to staff these lonely outposts, a fact that arouses Bloom's sympathy in Nausicaa: \"Life those chaps out there must have, stuck in the same spot.\" He remembers the crew of the Erin's King \"throwing them the sack of old papers,\" a frail lifeline to civilization. \n This memory, first recalled in Calypso, comes from a time when Bloom took his daughter Milly \"On the Erin's King that day round the Kish.\" Gifford notes that it was \"an excursion steamer that took sightseers on two-hour trips around Dublin Bay, circling the Kish lightship to the south or Ireland's Eye, an island just north of the Howth peninsula, to the north. During the summer it sailed several times a day from Custom House Quay in central Dublin; fare, one shilling.\"\n Bloom remembers the \"Damned old tub pitching about,\" but Milly did not suffer the fate of those \"lovely seaside girls,\" seasickness. In Nausicaa he remembers how her spirits contrasted with those of the adults on the ship: \"Drunkards out to shake up their livers. Puking overboard to feed the herrings. Nausea. And the women, fear of God in their faces. Milly, no sign of funk. Her blue scarf loose, laughing. Don't know what death is at that age.\" The memory comes back one last time in Eumaeus: \"the Irish lights, Kish and others, liable to capsize at any moment, rounding which he once with his daughter had experienced some remarkably choppy, not to say stormy, weather.\""

Shut your eyes and see.\" The sense of touch can confirm things that vision may leave ambiguous.\n The allusion to Boswell's Life of Johnson was first noticed by Robert M.

This delicious song of sexual seduction comments in many ways on the Blooms' marriage and Boylan's intrusion into it. Bloom thinks of several phrases from the duet, all of them discouraging, in subsequent chapters. The other number that Molly will be performing, Love's Old Sweet Song, carries more positive associations.",
    "expandedNote": " Don Giovanni (1787) is a version of the Don Juan story penned by librettist Lorenzo da Ponte. The anti-hero is a nobleman who takes advantage of his social position to seduce or rape many hundreds of women and girls (the current count, according to his servant Leporello, is 2,065) in Italy, Germany, France, Turkey, and Spain. Early in the opera, Giovanni comes upon a procession celebrating the upcoming marriage of two peasants named Masetto and Zerlina, and sets his sights on the bride. He gets rid of all the others and begins seducing Zerlina, who is tempted by his attentions but fears that he will leave when he has had his way with her. He promises that in his nearby casinetto (little villa) he will change her sorte (fate), by making her a nobleman's wife:\n Don Giovanni\n Là ci darem la mano, \n là mi dirai di sì. \n Vedi, non è lontano;\n partiam, ben mio, da qui.\n Zerlina\n (Vorrei e non vorrei; \n mi trema un poco il cor. \n Felice, è ver, sarei, \n ma può burlarmi ancor.) \n Don Giovanni\n Vieni, mio bel diletto!\n Zerlina\n Mi fa pietà Masetto.\n Don Giovanni\n Io cangerò tua sorte.\n Zerlina\n Presto, non son più forte! \n Don Giovanni\n Vieni! Vieni! \n Là ci darem la mano.\n Zerlina\n Vorrei e non vorrei.\n Don Giovanni\n Là mi dirai di si.\n Zerlina\n Mi trema un poco il cor.\n Don Giovanni\n Partiam, ben mio, da qui.\n Zerlina\n Ma può burlarmi ancor. \n Don Giovanni\n Vieni, mio bel diletto!\n Zerlina\n Mi fa pietà Masetto. \n Don Giovanni\n Io cangerò tua sorte.\n Zerlina\n Presto, non son più forte! \n Don Giovanni\n Andiam'! \n Zerlina\n Andiam'!\n Giovanni and Zerlina\n Andiam', mio bene, \n a ristorar le pene \n d’un innocente amor! \n There you will give me your hand,\n there you will tell me “yes.”\n You see, it is not far;\n Let's go from here, my beloved.\n (I would like to, and I wouldn't.\n My heart trembles a little.\n I would be happy to, it's true,\n but he may be tricking me.)\n Come, my beautiful love!\n I feel sorry for Masetto.\n I will change your fate.\n Soon I won’t be strong anymore!\n Come! Come!\n There you will give me your hand.\n I would like to, and I wouldn't.\n There you will tell me “yes.”\n My heart trembles a little.\n Let's go from here, my beloved.\n But he may be tricking me.\n Come, my beautiful love!\n I’m sorry for Masetto.\n I will change your fate.\n Soon I won’t be strong anymore!\n Let's go!\n Let's go!\n Let's go, my beloved,\n to relieve the pangs\n of an innocent love!\n There is nothing \"innocent\" about Giovanni's pangs, and \"Blazes\" Boylan seems cast very much in the same mold of the heartless seducer, but Molly is hardly innocent herself. She sees how the song bears on her marital situation and feels justified in taking some pleasure outside of a marriage lacking in sexual satisfaction: \"I know what Ill do Ill go about rather gay not too much singing a bit now and then mi fa pieta Masetto then Ill start dressing myself to go out presto non son piu forte Ill put on my best shift and drawers let him have a good eyeful out of that to make his micky stand for him Ill let him know if thats what he wanted that his wife is fucked yes and damn well fucked too up to my neck nearly not by him 5 or 6 times...serve him right its all his own fault if I am an adulteress as the thing in the gallery said O much about it if thats all the harm ever we did in this vale of tears God knows its not much doesnt everybody only they hide it.\" \n Although Molly finds much to dislike about Boylan after spending intimate time with him, she does not seem to have experienced any of Zerlina's hesitation before. When Bloom recalls Zerlina's first line in Calypso he misremembers it in a way that emphasizes his wife's very active participation in the adulterous liaison: \"Voglio e non vorrei. Wonder if she pronounces that right: voglio.\" Substituting the present indicative voglio (\"I want\") for the conditional vorrei (\"I would like\") calls the reader's attention to Molly's very active desire. In the next chapter, Lotus Eaters, even the one conditional verb has dropped out: \"Voglio e non.\" But one chapter after that Bloom does recall the line correctly: \"voglio e non vorrei. No: vorrei e non.\" \n It is a joke with multiple layers. Not only is Molly's pronunciation of the word irrelevant, since it does not appear in the duet, but voglio has a particular, unflattering application to Bloom himself. His counterpart in the seduction scene is the subjugated Masetto, and he outdoes Masetto in abjectness. Masetto in fact stands up for himself, trying in vain to stop the rapacious nobleman from exercising his droit de seigneur. Bloom never does, and his substitution of voglio connects him with Don Giovanni's servant Leporello, as Robert M. Adams has suggested (Surface and Symbol, 71). In a deliciously mock-heroic aria at the beginning of the opera, \"Notte e giornio faticar,\" Leporello dreams of throwing off the yoke of servitude and becoming a master himself. The rousing central declaration of this aria is \"Voglio far il gentiluomo, / E non voglio più servir\": \"I want to play the gentleman, / And I don't want to serve anymore.\" But at the end of the opera, after Giovanni has died, he goes looking for \"a better master,\" as much a servant as ever.\n It makes perfect sense for Bloom to identify with Leporello, as with Masetto. Calypso shows him to be a servant to his wife, and in Circe his failure to stand up to the violator of his marriage is enacted by having him serve Boylan as a butler, showing him into the house and conducting him to the room where Molly is stepping naked out of her bathtub. A phrase in Ithaca, \"supraracial prerogative,\" suggests that he acquiesces in the violation of his marriage in part because his Jewish heritage puts him in an inferior position to the ethnically Irish Boylan, like a peasant displaced by an aristocrat. \n Bloom tries to turn the tables, in fantasy, when he woos his former flame Josie Breen in Circe. With \"his fingers and thumb passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which she surrenders gently,\" he places on her finger a ring that signifies domination more than betrothal, and says, \"Là ci darem la mano.\" She replies with the same misremembered phrase that implied sexual excitement in Lotus Eaters: \"Voglio e non. You're hot! You're scalding!\" But, as Stephen says of Shakespeare's whoring in London, such \"Assumed dongiovannism\" cannot dispel the pain of being betrayed. In his introduction to Hades in James Joyce's Ulysses: Critical Essays, Adams observes that Bloom's recollection of another line from the song, \"Mi trema un poco,\" stops just short of articulating \"il core,\" the heart, which would add romantic heartbreak to all the other thoughts of broken hearts in the chapter (105).\n Other threads from Don Giovanni weave their way into Ulysses starting in Lestrygonians, when Bloom recalls the scene from the end of the opera in which the seducer is finally caught and punished. These details center on the image of feasting."

    "note": " Not least of the bewildering ways in which Proteus plunges the reader into the waves of Stephen's thoughts, with little connection to the dry land of plot, dialogue, and action, is its refusal to translate his kaleidoscopic multilingualism into English. After some scattered phrases inItalian, German, and Latin, Stephen leans into French, the foreign language that most colors the shifting verbal fabric of the chapter. Stephen is fluent in French, and he thinks of the brief time he lived in Paris as a would-be artist in exile. His internal monologue becomes peppered with language that he remembers from those days. This note, and two subsequent ones, translate those bits of French speech and provide some contextualizing interpretation.",
    "expandedNote": " Stephen's thoughts of Paris are triggered by the name of thePigeon House, which reminds him of a joke about pigeons (\"— C'est le pigeon, Joseph\") in La Vie de Jésus (\"The Life of Jesus\") by the irreverent French writer Léo Taxil. Stephen learned about the book from a young man named Patrice Egan, \"home on furlough\" from the French army. Patrice is the son of the wild goose Kevin Egan, whom Stephen has made a point of looking up in Paris.\n Stephen recalls Patrice saying, \"— C'est tordant, vous savez. Moi, je suis socialiste. Je ne crois pas en l'existence de Dieu. Faut pas le dire à mon père.\" (It's hilarious, you know. Me, I'm a socialist. I don't believe in the existence of God. But don't tell my father that.) Stephen asks, \"Il croit?\" (He's a believer?), and Patrice replies, \"Mon père, oui\" (\"My father, yes\"). \n As Stephen recalls looking at Patrice across the cafe table, the coincidental resemblance between the English verb \"lap\" and the French noun lapin (rabbit) turns Patrice, Proteus-like, into a bunny: \"he lapped the sweet lait chaud with pink young tongue, plump bunny's face. Lap, lapin.\"Lait chaud is the cup of warm milk that Patrice is drinking. Stephen thinks, \"He hopes to win in the gros lots\" (he hopes to hit the jackpot in the lottery.) The French lot stems from the same root as the English lottery, and a gros lot is a first prize, a jackpot. Patrice passes his days playing the numbers. In Circe he returns as a \"rabbitface,\" still proclaiming himself a \"Socialiste!\""

God, we simply must dress the character.\" (Haines too dresses informally in a \"soft grey hat.\")",
    "expandedNote": " Gifford describes Stephen's hat as “A soft or slouch hat associated with the art and student worlds of the Latin Quarter in Paris, as against the 'hard' hats (bowlers or derbies) then fashionable in Dublin.” In December 1902 Joyce mailed a Parisian photo-postcard of himself posing in such a hat to his friend J. F. Byrne. The look contrasts sharply with most of the headgear that one would have seen on Dublin streets.\n In Proteus Stephen thinks of this bohemian topper as \"my Hamlet hat.\" But its resemblance to certain clerical chapeaux causes some people to refer to Stephen as a clergyman. Early in Oxen of the Sun he is described as having the \"mien of a frere,\" and near the end of the chapter someone says or thinks, “Jay, look at the drunken minister coming out of the maternity hospal! Benedicat vos omnipotens Deus, Pater et Filius.” Shortly later, he is called \"Parson Steve.\" At the beginning of the next chapter, Circe, two British soldiers call out derisively to him as \"parson.\""

    "note": " Looking at the naked woman depicted in a scene from Ruby, Bloom notes that the illustrator has preserved some decorum: \"Sheet kindly lent.\" (And indeed it was in the actual printed book.) His phrase may irreverently echo the opening words of a popular hymn, \"Lead, Kindly Light,\" the words for which were written by John Henry Newman (later Cardinal Newman) in 1833 as a poem titled The Pillar of Cloud. Molly thinks of this hymn in Penelope.",
    "expandedNote": " Newman wrote the poem as a young priest when his ship was becalmed for a week between Corsica and Sardinia, after weeks of illness in which he was desperate to leave Italy and return to England. The first stanza expresses his state of physical longing and spiritual faith, with one step completed and many more to go: \n Lead, Kindly Light, amidst th'encircling gloom,\n Lead Thou me on!\n The night is dark, and I am far from home,\n Lead Thou me on!\n Keep Thou my feet; I do not ask to see\n The distant scene; one step enough for me. \n Set to several different tunes, the hymn has enjoyed great popularity. In the 20th century it was sung by trapped survivors of a mine explosion, by occupants of one of the Titanic's lifeboats, by troops going into the trenches in WWI, and by women being led to a concentration camp by S.S. troops.\n Zack Bowen (Musical Allusions, 88) infers an allusion because of the verbal similarities between \"Lead kindly light\" and \"Sheet kindly lent,\" and they are striking: assonance and near-alliteration (amounting to near-rhyme) in the first word, an identical second word, and identical alliteration at the beginning and the end of the third word. It is certain that Bloom knows the hymn, because Molly remembers how \"he got me on to sing in the Stabat Mater by going around saying he was putting Lead Kindly Light to music I put him up to that till the jesuits found out he was a freemason thumping the piano lead Thou me on copied from some old opera.\" As a Catholic cardinal and a famous Catholic convert, Newman's authorship of the hymn would certainly have recommended it to Jesuits organizing a performance of sacred music.\n What to make of Bloom's flippant reference to this inspirational religious song, in the context of a naked woman being beaten with a whip, is harder to imagine. He may simply be playing whimsically with the sounds of the words. But the effect is certainly at least a bit \"witty\"—a faculty he wonders whether he possesses."

    "note": " In Lotus Eaters, as Bloom stands on the corner of Westland Row and Great Brunswick Street scanning the \"multicoloured hoardings\" posted on a wall, he sees a notice for a theatrical production: \"Hello. Leah tonight. Mrs Bandmann Palmer. Like to see her again in that.\" The production of this powerful 19th century melodrama with a Jewish heroine makes him remember how much his father loved it, which in turn prompts feelings of guilt for abandoning the Jewish faith. Hades finds him thinking that he could go see the play \"tonight,\" which would fit perfectly with the plan he has apparently communicated to Molly, of eating out and going to a show at the Gaiety Theatre. But in Nausicaa he realizes that it is \"Too late.\" InIthaca he regrets not going, but he tells Molly that he has done so.",
    "expandedNote": " Leah, the Forsaken (1862) is a strong English-language adaptation by the American playwright John Augustin Daly of the hugely popular German-language Deborah (1849) by a Jewish-German-Austrian playwright, Salomon Hermann Mosenthal.Deborah was translated or adapted into more than a dozen European languages and given titles as various as Deborah, D'vorah, Leah, Miriam, Naomi, Rebecca, Ruth, Lysiah, Clysbia, and The Jewess. Trying to recall the original name, Bloom manages only to add another one to the list: \"What is this the right name is? By Mosenthal it is. Rachel, is it? No.\" Gifford speculates that he may be thinking of \"the Alsatian-Jewish actress Elisa Rachel (1821-58),\" who played the title role in some performances of Mosenthal's Deborah. But he may simply be remembering Leah's sister in the book of Genesis. \n The tragic story of Leah runs as follows: In the early 1700s in a violently anti-Semitic Austrian village, a young Catholic man named Rudolf falls in love with a passionate Jewish girl who has fled a pogrom in her native Hungary and is passing through the town, where by law she cannot settle even for a night. He offers to run off with her, but their conversation beneath \"a large ruined cross\" in the forest is overheard by an apostate Jew named Nathan, who has assimilated into Gentile society for two decades by hiding his past and becoming more intolerant than the natives. Nathan brings the unwelcome news to Rudolf's father Lorenz, and convinces father and son to let him test Leah by going to the forest and offering her money to renounce her love, but he pockets the gold and falsely tells Rudolf and Lorenz that Leah has accepted it. Rudolf repudiates Leah and marries the Austrian girl that his father has picked out for him, only to learn the truth from Leah after the wedding. Five years later, she shows up outside the couple's house, tenderly embraces their daughter, calls out the parents, and denounces Nathan. Nathan is led away by the police, and Leah falls dead at Rudolf's feet. \n This spectacular starring role attracted many famous actresses of the late 19th century, including the Czech Fanny Janauschek, the Italian Adelaide Ristori, the American Kate Bateman, the French Sarah Bernhardt, and the American Milly Bandmann-Palmer. In addition to longing to see Mrs. Bandmann-Palmer \"again\" in the part, Bloom recalls his father telling him how two more of these leading ladies played the role: \"Poor papa! How he used to talk of Kate Bateman in that. Outside the Adelphi in London waited all the afternoon to get in. Year before I was born that was: sixtyfive. And Ristori in Vienna.\"\n But one scene from Leah that deeply impressed Rudolph Bloom did not feature the heroine. Over and over again, he has told his son about a moment when Nathan's Jewish identity is discovered. Nathan has lived in constant fear of being recognized by Jews from his old country, and Leah's band of wandering Hungarian Jews poses a mortal threat to him. In the third act this threat comes to life: \"The scene he was always talking about where the old blind Abraham recognises the voice and puts his fingers on his face. / — Nathan's voice! His son's voice! I hear the voice of Nathan who left his father to die of grief and misery in my arms, who left the house of his father and left the God of his father. / Every word is so deep, Leopold.\" \n The scene in act 3 shows a \"dilapidated Hut\" where Leah has brought the blind old Abraham and Sarah to stay the night. Nathan enters it and tries to bribe Sarah to leave Austria and take Leah with her, but Abraham appears, saying, \"I hear a strange voice, and yet not a strange voice. . . . There was a man at Presburg, a man whose name was Nathan. He was a singer in the synagogue. It is his voice I hear. . . . It was said he became a Christian, and went out into the world. . . . He left his father to die in poverty and misery, since he had forsworn his faith, and the house of his kindred.\" Nathan tries to silence him all the while he is speaking, but Abraham says, \"I will not be silent. I hear the voice of Nathan. (passing his hand over NATHAN's face) And I recognize the features of Nathan.\" Nathan grabs him by the throat and strangles him. He \"loosens his grip from which ABRAHAMsinks supinely; at the same moment a thunder-bolt strikes the cabin, and the storm increases) / SARAH. (screams) He is dead!\" \n It seems clear that Leah, the Forsaken spoke powerfully to Rudolph Bloom because, like Leah, he was a Jew who left his native Hungary and wandered west. His particular interest in the scene with Nathan and old Abraham, however, is not so easy to explain. Perhaps he felt guilt over having \"left the house of his father and left the God of his father\" (Rudolph converted to Catholicism to marry Ellen Higgins). But his conversion cannot truly be called an apostasy, because Rudolph continued to live with Jews and he quietly preserved the memory of the religious traditions he was raised in, passing them down to his son.\n Leopold Bloom went much further, rejecting the Jewish faith completely and, after living among Jews for the first few years of his marriage, leaving them behind to associate with Gentiles. Any guilt that his father may have felt while watching the craven and murderous Nathan must have been greatly amplified in his own recollections of his father's words. His thoughts about how Nathan abandoned his father to poverty and death are immediately followed by thoughts of his own father's death: \"Poor papa! Poor man! I'm glad I didn't go into the room to look at his face. That day! O, dear! O, dear! Ffoo! Well, perhaps it was best for him.\"\n The reader of Lotus Eaters learns, then, that Bloom suffers from a psychic affliction very much like Stephen's: natural grief over the loss of a parent has become infected with religious guilt. In Bloom's case more time has passed and the ailment is not as crippling (\"Well, perhaps it was best for him\"), but his response to Leah contributes significantly to the mental parallels that the novel is constructing between its male protagonists."

    "note": " The mention of \"the steps from Leahy's terrace\" fixes Stephen's location at the beginning of Proteus fairly precisely, and also links him with the location of Bloom in Nausicaa. Leahy's Terrace is a road in the southeastern suburb of Sandymount. It runs SW-NE, beginning at Sandymount Road and terminating, at the time of the novel, at a seawall bordering Sandymount Strand. (Since that time, land has been reclaimed from the sea, pushing the seacoast further east.)",
    "expandedNote": " Stephen is walking on the sands exposed by the ebb tide and sees two women coming down the steps from the road to the beach. The Star of the Sea Church that focuses the action in Nausicaa is also sited on Leahy's Terrace, very near the water. It seems certain, then, that Bloom and Gerty MacDowell cannot be seated far from where Stephen is walking when he sees the two old women descend the steps for their walk on the beach.\n The steps that Stephen looks at no longer exist, and their former location is a matter for detective work. In 1960, before the Irishtown reclamation project, William York Tindall published a photograph of steps that he assumed were the ones mentioned in the book, and Clive Hart and Ian Gunn reproduced his image in their James Joyce's Dublin (2004). But they have discovered more recently that a smaller section of the strand was reclaimed in the 1920s, meaning that Joyce's steps must have been located still farther west, closer to the church.

    "note": " When the honorable Judge John M. Woolsey absolved Ulysses of pornographic intent, finding that it seeks to accurately represent human consciousness (\"his locale,\" after all, \"was Celtic and his season Spring\") and that \"nowhere does it tend to be an aphrodisiac,\" he charitably overlooked certain steamy passages of narration. One of the most egregious occurs in Sirens: \"On the smooth jutting beerpull laid Lydia hand, lightly, plumply, leave it to my hands. All lost in pity for croppy. Fro, to: to, fro: over the polished knob (she knows his eyes, my eyes, her eyes) her thumb and finger passed in pity: passed, repassed and, gently touching, then slid so smoothly, slowly down, a cool firm white enamel baton protruding through their sliding ring.\" This is pretty good pornographic writing—suggestive of graphic action, not merely suggestive or merely graphic; evocative of various kinds of physical pleasure, emotional involvement, and desire; palatable to both genders.",
    "expandedNote": " Of course, Joyce's sentences do represent the contents of human consciousness, and to anyone who dislikes pornography their artistic merit might possibly be defended on those grounds. But such an argument would never have flown in his time, and the fact that the humans involved are female would only have heightened the ire of that era's pervasive morality police, if they had been good enough readers to suspect the passage of a dark design. The chapter that most excited their outrage, Nausicaa, did so not only by making a respectable young woman the object of a lascivious male gaze but also by making her a willing, and more or less witting, participant in the excitement. \n The same is true here, where the bold flirtation that the barmaids have been carrying on with the customers, the admiring gazes that they have been receiving from them, the maternal pity that Lydia Douce feels for the croppy boy (\"Because their wombs,\" Bloom thinks), and the sense of danger the song gives her (\"Thrilled she listened, bending in sympathy to hear\"), all feed into the suggestive action that she performs. Bloom looks at her \"Blank face\" and thinks, \"Virgin should say: or fingered only,\" but, as with Gerty MacDowell two chapters later, lack of conscious awareness does not imply lack of desire. \n In the musical theme-and-variations manner characteristic ofSirens, this passage cunningly repeats something that Lydia said much earlier in the episode and imbues it with lustful coloration. Recently returned from a vacation at the beach, Miss Douce has asked Miss Kennedy, \n — Am I awfully sunburnt? \n Miss bronze unbloused her neck. \n — No, said Miss Kennedy. It gets brown after. Did you try the borax with the cherry laurel water? \n Miss Douce halfstood to see her skin askance in the barmirror gildedlettered where hock and claret glasses shimmered and in their midst a shell. \n — And leave it to my hands, she said. \n — Try it with the glycerine, Miss Kennedy advised. \n Hands that tend to her own body may also tend to a man's. As Joyce replied to a young admirer in Zurich who asked, \"May I kiss the hand that wrote Ulysses?\": \"No, it did lots of other things too.\""

    "note": " Joyce continued the story of Stephen Dedalus in Ulysses, but his persona had exhausted its potential. He needed a more adult protagonist, someone open to registers of experience that Stephen could not accommodate. The Homeric design of his new novel encouraged him to create such a person, \"many-minded,\" practical, tested by adversity. He found his Ulysses in the man he called \"Mr Leopold Bloom.\" Bloom too is autobiographical in many ways, the self-expression of an older James Joyce. But in many other ways he represents a leap outside of the artist's personality, an effort to sympathetically inhabit different registers of human existence. Several Jewish men appear to have contributed details to the portrait.",
    "expandedNote": " Bloom, born in 1866, is 38 years old in the novel. Joyce began writing Ulysses at age 32 and published it on his 40th birthday. By this time in his life he had metamorphosed considerably from the brilliant student and rebellious poet imaged in Stephen Dedalus. He was supporting a common-law wife and two children with an assortment of low-paying jobs, struggling desperately to publish his works in the face of brutal censorship forces, and beginning to suffer the serious health problems that would plague him for the rest of his life. His \"epic of the body,\" as he once called Ulysses, reflects his maturation from a young man of great intellectual promise into a middle-aged man defined by major life experiences. \n Countless details tie Bloom to the man who conceived him. The name on his birth certificate, \"Leopold Paula Bloom\" (Ithaca) jokingly reproduces the mistake that caused the future novelist to be officially registered as \"James Augusta Joyce\" (Ellmann, 21). It also suggests an androgynous interest in female experience that Joyce shared. Bloom's unprepossessing physicality, his lack of male bluster and dominance, his pacifism, his social marginality, his markedly anal sexuality, his voyeurism, his passion for female undergarments, his less than brilliant employment history, his religious apostasy, all encourage readers to identify him with the author. \n So too do Joyce's frequent suggestions that, in a different life, Bloom might himself have become a writer. The story he reads in Calypso makes him think of writing something similar that might earn him a bit of money, and his experience in the cabman's shelter in Eumaeus renews this aspiration to \"pen something out of the common groove.\" Ithaca recalls snatches of verse and acrostics that he composed as a young man. Lenehan says in Wandering Rocks, \"There's a touch of the artist about old Bloom.\" In context, all of these implications of equivalence between the uneducated and clownish Bloom and the sophisticated Joyce seem equivocal, wry, mocking. But there is more to it than that. Bloom thinks constantly, sensitively, and creatively about his world, in patterns that make his interior monologue, if not the equal of Stephen's self-consciously brilliant thoughts, at least a worthy counterpart to them. Ellmann remarks justly that Bloom's \"monologue is a continuous poetry, full of phrases of extraordinary intensity\" (362). \n But Bloom encompasses many other features that were not part of Joyce's life, beginning with the fact that he is descended from Hungarian Jews. Ellmann argues that Joyce's chief model in this regard was his close friend in Trieste, the writer named Ettore Schmitz but known by the pen name Italo Svevo, \"whose grandfather came from Hungary, and who wore the mustache that Joyce gave to Bloom, and like Bloom had a wife and daughter. . . . Schmitz was in many ways quite different from Bloom; but he had married a Gentile, he had changed his name (though only for literary purposes), he knew something of Jewish customs, and he shared Bloom's amiably ironic view of life. Joyce could not abide the inner organs of animals and fowl, while Schmitz, like Bloom, loved them. Some of these are small similarities, but Joyce had a spider's eye\" (374). \n Born in 1861, five years before Bloom and 21 years before Joyce, Schmitz was a prosperous businessman who met Joyce through the Berlitz school in Trieste. The young, impoverished teacher and his older, richer student became fast friends who took long walks through the city streets together, as Bloom and Stephen do at the end of June 16. Their families became close, as Bloom hopes may happen with Stephen. And Schmitz gave Joyce abundant information about Jewish traditions and the Jews living in Trieste.\n Another purported model for Bloom was the otherwise little-known Dubliner Alfred H. Hunter. Hunter reportedly played the Good Samaritan to Joyce in 1904, when the writer accosted an attractive young woman in St. Stephen's Green, not realizing that she had a boyfriend nearby. Abandoned by his friend Vincent Cosgrave, Joyce ended up, as he observed in a notebook, with a \"black eye, sprained wrist, sprained ankle, cut chin, cut hand.\" Hunter, whom Joyce had met briefly once or twice, is said to have come upon the scene, helped the writer up, and taken him home. Ellmann says that Hunter was \"rumored to be Jewish and to have an unfaithful wife\" (162). In fact he was not Jewish, as Louis Hyman notes (The Jews of Ireland, 169), but Ellmann got his information from Stanislaus Joyce, so James may very well have supposed him to be so. And Bloom, for that matter, is only ambiguously Jewish himself.\n Within a few years Joyce was thinking of putting Hunter in aDubliners story to be called \"Ulysses,\" which would follow the man as he wandered about Dublin. When Ulysses turned into a novel Joyce asked Stanislaus and his Aunt Josephine for more details about Hunter (Ellmann, 375). Several of these made it into the book, as Vivien Igoe observes in The Real People of Joyce's Ulysses. Hunter was born in the same year as Bloom. His wife was named Marion (though they married considerably later than the Blooms, in 1899), and the couple lived at a succession of different addresses. She was the daughter of a professor of music who served as grand organist of the Dublin Freemasons. Hunter worked as an advertising canvasser for the Freeman's Journal from 1902 onwards.\n Inspired perhaps by Hunter's \"corporal work of mercy\" (Cyclops, Ithaca), Joyce conceived Bloom as a man of kindness, compassion, and familial warmth. To some extent, he associated these ethical dispositions with Jews in general. Frank Budgen recorded that Joyce said to him of Jews, \"Look at them. They are better husbands than we are, better fathers and better sons,\" and Ellmann observes that he quietly valued two characteristics of Jews: \"their chosen isolation, and the close family ties which were perhaps the result of it\" (373). Bloom is not only a devoted husband and father. He extends his kindness to a young man whom he has briefly met only twice. He attends the funeral of an acquaintance with whom he was not close, and generously contributes money to his impoverished family. He visits a hospital to inquire about a distant acquaintance who is in her third day of labor. He gives food to gulls and to a stray dog. He thinks often of the condition of being cast out and in need.\n Recently, yet another Jewish model for Bloom has been proposed: \"Altman the Saltman,\" a nickname applied collectively to Albert Liebes Lascar Altman, his brother Mendal, Mendal's son Emanuel, and perhaps others in the family. The Altmans were prosperous Dublin merchants known for their salt business near the family home at 11 Usher's Island. In his Ulysses, published in the 1980s, Hugh Kenner recorded a Dublin rumor that he thought might explain the outlandish assertion in Cyclops that Bloom gave \"the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper.\" Kenner noted that the Dublin writer Anthony Cronin told him that \"Griffith was persistently rumoured to have a Jewish adviser-ghostwriter\" (133). In the last few years it has been suggested that this nationalist Jew was Albert Altman. Neil R. Davison, Vincent Altman O'Connor, and Yvonne Altman O'Connor have argued for this view in \"'Altman the Saltman’ and Joyce’s Dublin: New Research on Irish-Jewish influences in Ulysses,\" Dublin James Joyce Journal 6/7 (2013-2014): 44-72. \n [2020: A later article by Davison, \"'Ivy Day': Dublin Municipal Politics and Joyce's Race-Society Colonial Irish Jew,\" Journal of Modern Literature 42.4 (2019): 20-38, explores Albert Altman's complex nationalist political convictions in the context of Ivy Day in the Committee Room, suggesting that the short story's engagement with this capitalist but left-leaning Irish Jew laid the groundwork for the characterization of Bloom in Ulysses.]\n If the Altman hypothesis becomes widely accepted, it seems likely to force a substantial rethinking of Bloom's relation to the cause of Irish independence. Unusually for Dublin Jews, the Altman brothers were advanced nationalists who supported Parnell, Home Rule, and the Land League. They were peripherally associated with the Invincibles who carried out the Phoenix Park murders and also with the escape of the Fenian James Stephens. But many other, more personal details link Bloom to \"Altman the Saltman.\"\n Although Albert (born in the early 1850s) and Mendal (b. 1860) were older, wealthier, and more politically important than Bloom, the circumstances of their lives coincide in seemingly countless ways. Like Bloom's father in the 1860s, the Altman family emigrated to Ireland (from Prussian Poland rather than Hungary) in the 1850s. Albert Altman was Jewish but was expelled from Mary's Abbey synagogue in Dublin for marrying a Catholic, Susan O'Reilly from Cork, and after the death of Susan he married a Protestant woman, Victoria Olive Corbett, in Belfast—echoing Bloom's Jewish-Catholic-Protestant allegiances. His father Moritz Altman (né Shraga Moshe ben Aharon) died after ingesting poison, like Rudolph Bloom (né Rudolf Virag). His son Albert Denis (called Bertie, somewhat like Bloom's Rudy) died shortly after birth. And according to family lore his daughter Mary (known variously as Mim, Mimi, Maimie, or Maimy—her name resembles Milly) spurned the advances of James Joyce. \n The connections continue. Mimi was a singer. Mendal Altman had daughters named Cissy and Edy, like the girls on the beach in Nausicaa. His son Emanuel worked as a health inspector in Dublin's Cattle Market where his great adversary was the cattle dealer Joe Cuffe, Bloom's erstwhile employer. Albert Altman was a freethinker influenced by the atheist writer Charles Bradlaugh. He was a teetotaler who espoused the cause of Temperance, but he drank liturgical wine. He suffered the anti-Semitic slurs of sundry Dubliners as Bloom does, and he stood up to them to defend his people and their cultural traditions. Neither assimilationist nor exclusionary, he wished to be known as an Irishman who happened to be Jewish. Like Bloom, he advocated for various kinds of civic improvement: modernization of city fire brigades, establishment of a municipal manure-treatment facility, construction of the Main Drainage sewer lines, bringing the tramway system owned by William Martin Murphy under municipal control.\n Albert Altman was elected as a Councillor for the Usher's Quay ward in 1901 and he was succeeded by Mendal in 1907. He died in a blaze of publicity in 1903 shortly after exposing a scandal when he claimed that leading Councillors were dilatory in paying their rates to the disadvantage of the less well-off. (Thanks to Vincent Altman O'Connor for supplying many of the details in this summary of the life of Altman the Saltman.)\n Visually, Joyce probably had still other models in mind, including three men who were not Jewish. In her Shakespeare and Company (1960) Sylvia Beach recalls Joyce having told her that Bloom resembled George Holbrook Jackson, a British writer born in 1874 whom Joyce probably met in London. At Joyce's request she wrote to Jackson requesting that he send her a photograph of himself, but when she showed Joyce the photo of Jackson smoking a pipe, he remarked that it was \"not a good likeness. He doesn't look as much like Bloom in it\" (97). \n In Nausicaa Gerty MacDowell supplies another clue to how Joyce may have visualized Bloom: she says that, except for the mustache, he looks just like John Martin-Harvey, the dreamily handsome stage and screen idol. And in Penelope Molly recalls that, when he has courting her, she thought Bloom looked like the dashing Lord Byron, \"though he was too beautiful for a man.\" It seems clear that, although Bloom is frequently the object of derision or contempt in Ulysses, Joyce did not intend for him to lack sex appeal. \n A brief note such as this one, keyed to a few actual people who may have contributed to Joyce's protagonist, can only begin to delineate his protean qualities. Many more discoveries await the attentive reader of the novel. Indeed, it has been said that by reading Ulysses we come to know Bloom in more depth and detail than we know ourselves."

  "080000lestrygonians": {
    "note": " Episode 8, called \"Lestrygonians\" in Joyce's schemas, presents a relatively straightforward response to a short passage in Homer's Odyssey. Having left the newspaper offices at about 1:00, Bloom strolls southward down O'Connell, Westmoreland, and Grafton Streets and then heads east along Duke and Molesworth Streets to end up at the National Museum on Kildare Street. He is hungry. The chapter begins with him pausing at a candy shop, taking in its smells. As he walks on he sees famished people, and people selling food. Eventually he finds a place to have lunch, after being nauseated by the ambience of the first restaurant he enters. Inspired by the Homeric analogue, the chapter's prose relentlessly throws up figures of food, hunger, eating, digestion, excretion, baiting, feeding, killing, and cannibalism. Reflecting on food's passage down the alimentary canal (echoed by his own long passage down urban corridors hemmed in by large buildings, at the end of which he will search for a statue's anus), Bloom thinks also of time's passage and the changes it wreaks in human lives.",
    "expandedNote": " In book 10 of Homer's epic, just after the story of Aeolus and the winds, Odysseus recounts how his men rowed for six days to reach the land of Laestrygonia, where they found a harbor like a mouth:\n We reached the famous harbor, all surrounded\n by sheer rock cliffs. On each side, strips of shore\n jut out and almost meet, a narrow mouth. (88-90)\n Most of the ships dropped anchor inside this harbour, but Odysseus cautiously moored his vessel just outside it. Three men were dispatched to go inland and see who lived there. They met a girl fetching water—the daughter of the king, Antiphates—and she took them back to the palace, where her mother, a giant, grabbed and ate one of the men. A force of giants led by her father pursued the other men back to the harbor, wrecked the anchored ships by bombarding them with huge boulders, and speared the floating sailors for supper. Only Odysseus and his crew escaped.\n Since Joyce identified the art of his chapter as \"architecture,\" it seems likely that he meant for the imposing buildings flanking Bloom as he walks—the Ballast House, the \"surly front\" of Trinity College, the Bank of Ireland, the canyon of Grafton Street, the bend into Duke Street—to evoke the cliffs that frame the Lestrygonian harbor. Other details in the two schemas neither require conjecture nor add much to the impressions that any attentive reader will take from the chapter's prose. The Linati schema identifies the color of the chapter as \"sanguigno\" (blood-red), the technique as \"peristaltic prose,\" the organ as the \"esophagus,\" and the symbols as \"bloody sacrifice: food: shame.\" The Gilbert schema adds a correspondence between the Lestrygonians and \"Teeth.\" \n In addition to countless mentions of food, most of them benign and some wonderfully funny, Joyce's chapter features some decidedly dark thoughts about the brutal business of eating. As in many other chapters of Ulysses, the violent interpersonal conflicts of Homer's poem are recast as conflicts within the human psyche. Bloom is horrified by meat-eating in Lestrygonians, but his modest vegetarian lunch does not begin to absolve him of his species' carnivorous murderousness. Feeling compassionate sympathy for butchered cows and sheep, as he does, does not change the fact that he and most of his kind regularly eat them. \n Other animals are no different. When he feeds some gulls from the O'Connell Bridge, moved by pity for \"Those poor birds,\" Bloom becomes \"Aware of their greed and cunning\" and does not waste a second penny. Life on earth inevitably involves taking life from others, and thinking of the whole bloody business can leave even the cannibals at the top of the food chain feeling cannibalized: \"This is the very worst hour of the day. Vitality. Dull, gloomy: hate this hour. Feel as if I had been eaten and spewed.\" The Linati schema identified the Sense/Meaning of the 8th chapter as \"L'abattimento\" (dejection, despondency). \n Although Bloom has no particular horror of the stuff that comes out of the intestines (rather the contrary), he does feel discouraged by the unending daily need to eat: \"stuffing food in one hole and out behind: food, chyle, blood, dung, earth, food: have to feed it like stoking an engine.\" The cyclicality of food becoming waste and re-entering the mouth reconstituted as food has been anticipated earlier as he stood on the bridge, gazing at the feces-laden Liffey: \"If I threw myself down? Reuben J's son must have swallowed a good bellyful of that sewage.\" The alimentary channel forms a torus through which the physical environment flows uninterrupted. Eater and eaten, food and excrement, make up an endlessly repeated cycle.\n The elemental need to fill one's stomach day after day discourages Bloom. In one brief passage of a few paragraphs, he thinks of how dinner invitations bait young men into joining the revolutionary cause; how trams and policemen go in and out, in and out, every day of the year; how dead bodies are \"carted off,\" and screaming babies \"tugged out,\" every day of the year; how an entire \"cityful\" of people is replaced with a new \"cityful\" of people, over and over again; how cities themselves, and their wealth, are \"worn away age after age.\" His conclusion: \"No one is anything.\" Even planets and stars wink in and out: \"Same old dingdong always. Gas: then solid: then world: then cold: then dead shell drifting around, frozen rock, like that pineapple rock.\" Later, his contemplations of transience become personal as he remembers kissing Molly on Howth Head and accepting the chewed seedcake from her mouth while a nannygoat walked by, \"dropping currants.\" The passage of food reminds him that the passage of ten years has destroyed his marital happiness: \"Me. And me now.\" \n Aeolus announces the coming end of what Joyce called the \"initial style\" of his novel: experimental but still recognizably conventional third-person objective narration, stuffed with interior monologue and with free indirect discourse that pulls the narrative into the orbits of particular characters' thoughts. The all-caps headline-like titles of the newspaper chapter are the first of many bold departures from this initial style. Subsequent chapters explore entirely new ways of telling the story, but Lestrygonians affords a pause. Like the relief that Calypso offers to the exhausted reader of Proteus, this chapter draws back from the strangeness of Aeolus to offer one last experience of a by-now accustomed mode of narration. It is an oasis of familiarity before the coming disorientations."

It was also famously destroyed in late antiquity, so Stephen's self-mortifying fantasy is a little over the top. But Joyce actually did give instructions that were only slightly less pretentious.",
    "expandedNote": " So important were his early \"epiphanies\" in his ambition to become a great prose artist that Joyce at one time viewed them as masterpieces, rather than simply sketches. The editors of a webpage on the epiphanies published by The James Joyce Centre note that in 1902, \"as he was preparing to leave for Paris, Joyce gave Stanislaus (who was keeper of the manuscript of the epiphanies) instructions that, in the event of his death, copies of the epiphanies were to be sent to all the major libraries of the world, including the Vatican\" (emphasis added). See http://jamesjoyce.ie/epiphanies.\n For several centuries, from the 3rd century BC to the 1st AD, the Hellenistic library at Alexandria was a great center of learning, visited by scholars from throughout the Mediterranean world. The library preserved every single text it could get its hands on, often by seizing scrolls carried by visitors to the city, returning copies to them, and keeping the originals. According to tradition, the library was destroyed in a great fire, but scholars have not been able to determine exactly when or how it may have happened."

    "note": " Kevin Egan may have left Ireland for \"gay Paree\" decades ago, but the Irish Catholic puritanical distrust of sexuality remains strong in him. He keeps his memory of a young Swedish woman \"who rubs male nakedness in the bath at Upsala\" stored next to cautionary tales of \"Licentious men\" like \"Félix Faure,\" a French politician who died in flagrante delicto.",
    "expandedNote": " Félix François Faure was the seventh President of France from 1895 until his death in 1899. In 1897 he met Marguerite Steinheil, a 28-year-old married woman who hosted a salon frequented by many prominent Parisians. Shortly after their first meeting, they began an affair that ran until 16 February 1899, when servants were called into the salon bleu in the Palais de l'Élysées to find the President unconscious on a sofa and Mme. Steinheil hastily putting her clothes in order. According to rumor, the two had been engaged in some particularly energetic fellatio. After Faure's death (by cerebral hemorrhage, according to Gifford), Steinheil conducted sexual affairs with many other famous men. Egan's comment is: \"Félix Faure, know how he died? Licentious men.\"\n From there he is off to memories of a public bath where a young Swedish woman offered massages to the clients. \"Moi faire, she said, Tous les messieurs. [I do all the gentlemen.] Not this Monsieur, I said. Most licentious custom. Bath a most private thing. I wouldn't let my brother, not even my own brother, most lascivious thing.\" Leaving aside the interesting notion that no one should be more physically intimate with a man than his own brother, it seems worthwhile to note that Egan's assumptions about sexual relations between men and women (\"Lascivious people\") are markedly censorious. \n Stephen Dedalus seems like an ironically inapt audience for Egan's fulminations: he has been receiving a lot more than massages from prostitutes since his early teens, and he seems to relish the sexual decadence of Paris. But for all his sexual adventurism, he has not overcome his religious indoctrination in the wickedness of sexuality. (As Buck Mulligan says in Telemachus, \"you have the cursed jesuit strain in you, only it's injected the wrong way.\") So perhaps Egan does have some limited rapport with the man he's talking to. Later in Proteus, as he imagines the \"writhing weeds\" under the surface of the water to be women, Stephen echoes Egan's language: \"Weary too in sight of lovers, lascivious men, a naked woman shining in her courts, she draws a toil of waters.\""

    "note": " Nursery rhymes dance through Bloom's thoughts throughout the day, probably reflecting his experience as a devoted parent, but also suggesting childlike qualities in him, and an ad-man's propensity for jingles. Some nursery rhymes become freighted with textual significance, while others play a more incidental role in the fiction. Thornton identifies two seemingly slight allusions near the beginning of Calypso,and does not note a third possibility. Together with a more substantial allusion later in the chapter, these three rhymes all involve food.",
    "expandedNote": " Bloom watches the cat at her saucer of milk as \"She lapped slower, then licking the saucer clean.\" There is probably an echo here of the Jack Sprat ditty from Mother Goose, the most familiar modern version of which runs:\n Jack Sprat could eat no fat;\n His wife could eat no lean.\n And so between them both, you see,\n They licked the platter clean.\n In the 16th and 17th centuries the name Jack Sprat was idiomatic for a short, scrawny man. Bloom is not short, but he is a bit weak—he has been practicing Sandow's exercises to beef up his muscles. And Molly does perhaps enjoy luxurious food a little more than her husband—in Lestrygonians Nosey Flynn remembers meeting Bloom \"with a jar of cream in his hand taking it home to his better half. She's well nourished, I tell you. Plovers on toast.\" Still, it seems a stretch to apply the nursery rhyme to Joyce's couple. \n The same is true of a similar echo several sentences later, when Bloom thinks about his wife's eating preferences: \"Thin bread and butter she likes in the morning.\" There may be an echo here of Little Tommy Tucker, also from Mother Goose: \n Little Tommy Tucker\n Sings for his supper.\n What shall we give him?\n White bread and butter. \n How shall he cut it\n Without any knife?\n How will he be married \n Without any wife? \n Brown bread sometimes substitutes for white in the rhyme, and Thornton says that \"Though I have not located it in print, I believe there is a variant reading 'Thin bread and butter.'\" If so, thoughts of eating continue to be inflected through Mother Goose.\n Together with these two allusions noted by Thornton and Gifford, there are these sentences from the fourth paragraph of Calypso: \"He turned from the tray, lifted the kettle off the hob and set it sideways on the fire. It sat there, dull and squat, its spout stuck out.\" The second sentence brings to mind the song I'm a Little Teapot, one version of which goes as follows: \n I'm a little teapot,\n Short and stout.\n Here is my handle,\n Here is my spout.\n When I get all steamed up\n Hear me shout,\n Just tip me over \n and pour me out!\n The song, written by George Harold Sanders and Clarence Z. Kelley, was published in the United States in 1939, but its verbal similarities to Bloom's thoughts are close enough to suggest that it may have been based on an earlier nursery rhyme. \n Later in Calypso A Song of Sixpence will make repeated appearances. The theme of eating is present in this rhyme too, but Joyce uses it to evoke aspects of the sexual dysfunction in the Blooms' marriage."

In Lotus Eaters he stands in the church and imagines meeting Martha in the flesh, thinking that she could \"Turn up with a veil and black bag. Dusk and the light behind her.\" The reference is to a one-act operetta by Gilbert & Sullivan in which a young man woos a woman so unattractive that she could seem desirable only in such lighting conditions.",
    "expandedNote": " Trial by Jury, first produced at London's Royalty Theatre in 1875, was the second of many great collaborations between Arthur Sullivan and W. S. Gilbert. It was a success, and went on tour throughout the British Isles in subsequent years. The operetta features a breach-of-promise lawsuit engendered by a young attorney's ambition to succeed in his profession. He lacks the money to get ahead, so he falls \"in love\" with a successful attorney's daughter:\n When I, good friends, was call'd to the bar\n I'd an appetite fresh and hearty,\n But I was, as many young barristers are,\n An impecunious party.\n I'd a swallow-tail coat of a beautiful blue,\n And a brief which I bought of a booby,\n A couple of shirts, and a collar or two,\n And a ring that looked like a ruby.\n He'd a couple of shirts, and a collar or two,\n And a ring that look'd like a ruby.\n At Westminister Hall I danc'd a dance\n Like a semi-despondent fury,\n For I thought I never should hit on a chance\n Of addressing a British jury.\n But I soon got tired of third-class journeys\n And dinners of bread and water,\n So I fell in love with a rich attorney's\n Elderly, ugly daughter.\n So he fell in love with a rich attorney's\n Elderly, ugly daughter.\n The rich attorney, he jump'd with joy\n And replied to my fond professions,\n \"You shall reap the reward of your pluck, my boy\n At the Bailey and Middlesex Sessions.\n You'll soon get used to her looks,\" said he,\n \"And a very nice girl you will find her.\n She may very well pass for forty-three\n In the dusk, with a light behind her.\"\n She has often been taken for forty-three\n In the dusk, with a light behind her.\n The prospective father-in-law is \"good as his word.\" He sends plenty of business to the young barrister, who becomes rich and then finds himself less enamored of the elderly, ugly daughter. The result is the breach-of-promise lawsuit. \n Bloom's cautious skepticism about epistolary self-representations feels prophetic. Probably many thousands of 21st century amatory hopefuls—male, female, and otherwise—have thought something like \"Dusk and the light behind her\" after meeting their internet correspondents in the flesh."

    "note": " In his Shakespeare talk, which is studded with countless phrases from the bard's works, Stephen uses a term for a sexually unfaithful woman from Much Ado about Nothing: \"light-of-love.\" He uses the phrase again in Circe, where it also shows up in Bloom's mouth.",
    "expandedNote": " The OED traces \"light of love\" to early appearances that declare it a cousin of the Elizabethan use of \"light\" to mean \"sexually inconstant.\" In Euphues (1579) John Lyly uses it as an adjectival phrase: \"Ah wretched wench, canst thou be so lyght of love, as to chaunge with every winde?\" In Thomas Proctor's A Gorgeous Gallery of Gallant Inventions (1578) it is a noun denoting loose love: \"The fickle are blamed: their lightilove shamed.\" Later uses cited in the OED show that it could also be a name for the loose women themselves, as in John Fletcher's The Chances (1618): \"Sure he has encountered / Some light-o-love or other.\" \n The phrase also became the title of an Elizabethan dance tune. (It was a \"turkeylony,\" a form possibly derived from thetordiglione, a type of Italian galliard.) In the scene of Much Ado about Nothing in which Hero prepares for her wedding and Beatrice frets over her newfound love for Benedick, while Margaret needles both of them with sexual innuendo, this popular tune figures in the dialogue:\n Hero. Why, how now? Do you speak in the sick tune?\n Beatrice. I am out of all other tune, methinks.\n Margaret. Clap's into \"Light a' love\": that goes without a burden. Do\n you sing it, and I'll dance it.\n Beatrice. Ye light a' love with your heels! then if your husband have\n stables enough, you'll see he shall lack no barns.\n Margaret. O illegitimate construction! I scorn that with my heels. \n (3.4.41-51)\n A \"burden\" was the bass line in a song, and the word acknowledges the heaviness of Beatrice's love-longing, but it also echoes \"the weight of a man\" from several lines earlier. \"Light . . . with your heels\" evokes \"light-heeled,\" another idiom for unchastity. \"Barns\" extends the theme of \"stables,\" but also puns on \"bairns\" or children. \"Illegitimate\" refers not only to faulty logic but also to the fruits of promiscuity. The lush word play in these lines suggests that the lyrics of this tune (now lost?) must have set lustful thoughts racing through Elizabethan minds. \n In Scylla and Charybdis Stephen imagines every sexually adventurous \"light-of-love\" in London keeping a copy of Venus and Adonis in her bedroom. In Circehe thinks of Shakespeare, Socrates, and Aristotle each dominated by his \"light of love.\" In the same chapter Bloom strangely addresses the constable who is about to arrest him as both a Mason and an inconstant lover: \"No, no, worshipful master, light of love. Mistaken identity.\""

    "note": " \"He turned from the morning noises of the quayside and walked through Lime street.\" In the first paragraph of Lotus Eaters, having walked eastward along the quay that fronts the river, Bloom turns south onto Lime Street through a very ugly part of town that no longer exists. Near \"Brady's cottages\" he contemplates the poverty of a boy and a girl who inhabit this wretched slum.",
    "expandedNote": " Commentators have had remarkably little to say about \"a boy for the skins.\" Gifford glosses the phrase as referring to \"A boy who has been making the rounds of trash heaps and garbage cans\" (though he supplies no source for this information) and explains his \"linked\" bucket as meaning \"Held by a chain or cord rather than a handle.\" The \"offal\" in the bucket is less obscure: it refers to those internal organs of animals that are not normally regarded as fit for human consumption. It seems, then, that the boy has been collecting the leavings of butcher shops—bringing home the bacon, or the impoverished equivalent of Bloom's pork kidney. Kidneys are offal in orthodox Jewish cultures, and in Circe Bloom purchases \"a lukewarm pig's crubeen,\" or pig's foot, and \"a cold sheep's trotter,\" a sheep's foot, so he and the poor boy have something in common. The young girl that he sees next holds a \"battered caskhoop,\" which Gifford glosses as a toy which she too has salvaged from the trash, \"the discarded hoop from a barrel.\" By Gifford's reading, then (and no one has offered anything better), both children are the equivalent of Brazil's catadores, trash-pickers.\n Brady's cottages lined a small alley off Lime Street. The exhibit from which the first photograph is taken, \"Derelict Dublin, 1913,\" on the website of the Dublin City Public Libraries, comments: \"This photograph is one of those taken by W. J. Joyce in 1913 to illustrate the dreadful living conditions in Dublin. Over 50 people lived in this small row of cottages in 1911. It was noted that in some cases this type of cottage was unhealthier than the tenements as there was no possibility of getting access to pure air or to sunlight. The overcrowding in Brady’s Cottages was particularly bad, with up to ten people living in a two-roomed cottage in 1901.\" \n Dublin is still a city in which prosperous neighborhoods live cheek by jowl with blighted ones, but in 1904 the socioeconomic chasms were gargantuan. Middle-class citizens like Bloom, who were proportionally not very numerous, rubbed elbows every day with a vast underclass. Joyce's fictions identify with the striving middle classes, but they cast frequent glances at the hopeless underclasses that crowded Dublin's \"tenements\" (mostly decayed Georgian townhouses) and \"cottages\" like Mr. Brady's squalid development."

The description of Bloom's feet seems strange (is he leaning to one side?) only because it employs a common 19th century usage that has since become obsolete: \"list slippers\" were soled with fabric, making them more comfortable than outdoor footwear and also much quieter. Joyce puts them into his narrative to indicate Bloom's solicitous care toward his possibly sleeping wife.",
    "expandedNote": " In a personal communication, Vincent Van Wyk notes that he sought an obscure meaning of this word and found it on World Wide Words (www.worldwidewords.org), a blog which Michael Quinion compiled from 1996 until 2017. In response to a reader's question about the meaning of \"list slippers\" in Arnold Bennett's The Old Wives' Tale (1908), Quinion reports that one meaning of \"list\" documented in the OED is a border or boundary. Medieval jousting tournaments were held in the \"lists,\" a space defined by wooden walls separating the warriors from the spectators. (\"On pain of death,\" says the marshal in Shakespeare's Richard II, \"no person be so bold / Or daring-hardy as to touch the lists.\") Pieces of fabric were similarly bordered by \"lists,\" hems of selvage that prevented them from unraveling. At some point in history, these securely woven edging materials were adapted to serve as the soles of slippers.\n Quinion observes that gunners on Royal Navy ships, as described in C. S. Forester's Lieutenant Hornblower, wore list slippers when handling gunpowder to lessen the risk of sparks. But The Old Wives' Tale calls attention to a different virtue: \"Sophia wore list slippers in the morning. It was a habit which she had formed in the Rue Lord Byron—by accident rather than with an intention to utilize list slippers for the effective supervision of servants.\" The implication is that these cloth-soled slippers were very quiet. Quinion quotes from an 1878 parenting manual which prescribes that in sick rooms nurses should wear \"list slippers—soles and all being made of list,\" and he observes that in Oscar Wilde's The Canterville Ghost (1887) the poor ghost \"gave up all hope of ever frightening this rude American family, and contented himself, as a rule, with creeping about the passages in list slippers.\" In addition to the works that Quinion cites, at least one other 19th century fiction emphasizes the quietness of these slippers: in Jane Eyre (1847) Grace Poole emerges from the door leading to the mysterious upper story and the protagonist sees her \"glide along the gallery, her quiet tread muffled in a list slipper.\"\n The stealthy, soothing quietness of list slippers has clear relevance to the passage in Ithaca. Several sentences earlier Stephen has watched Bloom, through the kitchen window, \"removing in turn each of his two boots.\" This day-ending ritual no doubt affords the paterfamilias great relief after tramping the streets of Dublin in leather shoes for 17 hours, but it soon becomes clear that he changes footwear the moment he gets inside his house so as not to awaken Molly. Honoring some kind of unnarrated guidance from his host, Stephen takes pains to make no noise on his way from the front steps to the kitchen: \"entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and followed softly along the hallway the man's back and listed feet and lighted candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down a turning staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of Bloom's house.\""

    "expandedNote": " Much of this water came (and still comes) from Lithia Springs, Georgia in the U.S. The lithium salts in the water were supposed to cure various ailments, and doctors prescribed it for their patients. In 1888 a resort spa opened in Lithia Springs, and the water also began to be bottled and sold. \n When Richie Goulding says (in Stephen's imagination), \"Damn your lithia water. It lowers,\" it is not clear whether he is referring to some preference of Stephen's or whether he is using \"your\" in a generic sense. Nor is the sense of \"lowers\" made very clear. Does lithia water lower one's metabolism? one's spirits? the strength or flavor of one's \"malt\"? The OED notes that \"lower\" can mean \"to dilute.\" It offers several examples, including one from Dickens' Martin Chuzzlewit: \"What do you go a lowerin' the table-beer for then?\"\n It seems most likely that Richie is rejecting the theory that \"Whusky\" should be diluted with a drop of water, and especially mineral water. In \"A Little Cloud,\" Ignatius Gallaher greets his old chum with a discussion of the issue: \"Hallo, Tommy, old hero, here you are! What is it to be? What will you have?

    "note": " Demonstrating his familiarity with all parts of the globe, \"skipper Murphy\" reveals a solemn mystery of the Far East: \"— I seen a Chinese one time, related the doughty narrator, that had little pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened and every pill was something different. One was a ship, another was a house, another was a flower. Cooks rats in your soup, he appetisingly added, the chinks does.\" Not only could these toys have been found in Europe in 1904—no travels needed—but they were most likely Japanese in origin. Joyce probably encountered them in Marcel Proust's monumental novel In Search of Lost Time: it was being sequentially published in France at the time that he was writing Ulysses, and when he wrote Eumaeushe was living in Paris. If this inference is correct, then the seemingly inconsequential little recollection resonates with implications about the survival of the past in the present, in a chapter preoccupied with that theme.",
    "expandedNote": " Only once in Eumaeus is Murphy called the \"narrator,\" and it comes just before an echo of the foremost example of first-person narration in 20th century fiction. The most famous passage of Proust's long novel, at the end of the first chapter of Swann's Way (1913), tells how the little village of his youth which he calls \"Combray\" became miraculously present once again when he tasted a bit of cake dipped in tea. In this marvellous passage the narrator recalls how the visual details of the village \"rose up like a stage set\" in his memory. Then, in an extended simile featuring one of the novel's many bits of japonerie, he heightens the magic by describing how the same thing can happen when little pieces of folded paper are dropped into a bowl of water.\n Here is the passage, in Scott Moncrieff's translation: \"And as soon as I had recognised the taste of the piece of madeleine soaked in her decoction of lime-blossom which my aunt used to give me (although I did not yet know and must long postpone the discovery of why this memory made me so happy) immediately the old grey house upon the street, where her room was, rose up like a stage set to attach itself to the little pavilion opening on to the garden which had been built out behind it for my parents (the isolated segment which until that moment had been all that I could see); and with the house the town, from morning to night and in all weathers, the Square where I used to be sent before lunch, the streets along which I used to run errands, the country roads we took when it was fine. And as in the game wherein the Japanese amuse themselves by filling a porcelain bowl with water and steeping in it little pieces of paper which until then are without character or form, but, the moment they become wet, stretch and twist and take on colour and distinctive shape, become flowers or houses or people, solid and recognisable, so in that moment all the flowers in our garden and in M. Swann's park, and the water-lilies on the Vivonne and the good folk of the village and their little dwellings and the parish church and the whole of Combray and its surroundings, taking shape and solidity, sprang into being, town and gardens alike, from my cup of tea.\" \n I have never seen \"little pieces of paper\" precisely like the ones Proust describes, but as the accompanying video by artist Étienne Cliquet demonstrates, such origami is still being practiced in France. All folded paper tends to unfold in water, perhaps because folding stretches the wood fibers and loads them with potential energy, while wetting the fibers (which happens slowly, through capillary action) gives them a way to return to a lower energy state. Today, one can buy many other toys that expand in water, including some containing small sponges that have been cut into recognizable shapes and packed inside pill capsules. When one of these capsules dissolves in water, the sponge inside opens and swells to become an animal or a vehicle or an action figure. Joyce's \"little pills like putty\" may perhaps be a precursor to these, since gelatin capsules for delivering medications were invented in 1833. But even if this is the case, his account of all the things packed inside the pills (\"One was a ship, another was a house, another was a flower\") seems clearly to owe its inspiration to Proust.\n The observation that Joyce's passage echoes Proust's was first made by James H. Maddox, Jr. in \"Eumaeus and the Theme of Return in Ulysses,\" Texas Studies in Literature and Language 16.1 (1974): 211-20. Maddox sees the allusion as tipping the reader off to the fact that in Eumaeus the characters are always threatening to become reincarnations of great figures from the past: Ulysses, Christ, Charles Stewart Parnell. If he is right, this is not the end of the passage's implications. Bloom, for instance, is forever revisiting the past: the day on Howth when he asked Molly to marry him, the day when she became pregnant with Rudy, the afternoon of the inquest into his father's death, and so on. In Oxen of the Sun he stares at a bottle of Bass ale, lost in thought, \"recollecting two or three private transactions of his own.\" Several paragraphs earlier, the reader has learned what these private memories are: a day when he headed out for high school with a bookbag over his shoulder, a day a year or so later when he was practicing his father's trade of traveling salesman, the night when he first visited a prostitute named Bridie Kelly. \n Stephen too revisits vivid memories from his past, as does Molly. To list them all would be tedious, but a copious account of the three characters' recollections would show how right John S. Rickard was to speak of Joyce's Book of Memory. Not only does Joyce clearly believe what Stephen says in Scylla and Charybdis—\"I, entelechy, form of forms, am I by memory\"—but he appears to hold a Proustian view that the past never really goes away. When we re-collect or re-member, we simply allow the shapes to assemble again, like little pieces of paper on water. As another modernist writer, William Faulkner, famously wrote, \"The past is never dead. It's not even past.\" From this insight hinted at in Eumaeus, it is only a small step to Finnegans Wake."

    "note": " An Odysseus manqué, Bloom dreams throughout the day (beginning with his Mideastern reveries in Calypso and Lotus Eaters) of seeing the sights in far-flung places. His fantasies turn bittersweet in Ithaca when he contemplates leaving Molly: the narrative notes that \"departure\" is rendered \"desirable\" by \"The attractive character of certain localities in Ireland and abroad,\" i.e. famous tourist attractions. Nearby, there are wonders recalling the enthusiastic lists in Cyclops: \"The cliffs of Moher, the windy wilds of Connemara, lough Neagh with submerged petrified city, the Giant's Causeway, Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle, the Golden Vale of Tipperary, the islands of Aran, the pastures of royal Meath, Brigid's elm in Kildare, the Queen's Island shipyard in Belfast, the Salmon Leap, the lakes of Killarney.\" Bloom's aspiration to travel to these celebrated sites invites comparison with Gabriel Conroy's deteremination to \"journey westward\" at the end of The Dead.",
    "expandedNote": "Three of the national treasures listed in Ithaca are in the west, near Galway. Countless paintings, postcards, and posters have featured the dramatic \"cliffs of Moher,\" southwest of the Burren in County Clare. Running for nearly 10 miles along the coast and dropping hundreds of feet vertically into the North Atlantic, they give one a sense of coming to the abrupt, jagged end of the earth. \n The \"windy wilds of Connemara\" lie some 40 miles farther north on the same rugged coast. A cultural region in the western part of County Galway, Connemara has stony land, poor people, winds perpetually promising rain or snow, and the largest Gaeltacht in Ireland. It is famous for its rare green-veined \"Connemara marble,\" mentioned in Cyclops. That chapter also mentions the \"Connemara hills,\" and Oxen of the Sun refers to \"the wilds of Connemara.\" \n Directly between these two sites, at the mouth of Galway Bay, lie the three famous \"islands of Aran,\" another stronghold of the Irish language. Beginning in 1898 John Millicent Synge spent several summers on these remote islands, soaking up the rhythms of western speech that came to suffuse his six plays. Joyce himself visited Aran with Nora in 1912 and wrote two Italian newspaper articles about its islands, which continue to hold huge appeal for tourists from Ireland and around the world.\n Three more inspiring sites are in the north, starting with \"lough Neagh with submerged petrified city.\" This freshwater lake shared by Counties Antrim, Tyrone, Armagh, Down, and Londonderry is the largest anywhere in Ireland or Britain, and its extensive \"banks,\" mentioned in Thomas Moore's Let Erin Remember the Days of Old, are one of the Irish glories said to be embroidered on the Citizen's impossibly crowded handkerchief. Ithaca recalls one of several old legends about the lake's origins: Gerald of Wales' Topographia Hiberniae (ca. 1188) reports that it formed when someone neglected to replace the lid covering an ancient city's freshwater spring. The entire city was drowned, and Gerald reports that on calm days fishermen can see tall round \"ecclesiastical towers\" rising up from the lake bottom. Moore's poem mentions these round towers as well. \n Some 20 miles east of the lake lies \"the Queen's Island shipyard in Belfast,\" a massive manmade island (nearly 200 acres) occupied for many generations by shipbuilders Harland and Wolff. Originally called Dargan's island for the man who directed the dredging and filling operation, the land became Queen's Island in 1849 after Victoria paid a visit to Belfast. As the chief builder for the White Star Line, Harland & Wolff produced the famous trio of Olympic-class ocean liners: RMS Olympic (launched 1911), RMS Titanic (launched 1912), and RMS Brittanic (launched 1914). Eumaeus repeatedly evokes icebergs and large ships in ways that suggest the Titanic disaster. In recent decades, a large chunk of the island has been renamed the Titanic Quarter and given over to developments encouraging the tourist trade. \n North of Lough Neagh, on the coast of County Antrim, is \"the Giant's Causeway,\" a spectacular formation of some 40,000 hexagonal basalt columns stretching from a seaside cliff northward into the water. Legend has it that Finn MacCumhaill (a giant in this story, though not elsewhere) laid them down to walk across the sea and fight a Scottish giant who had taunted him from across the narrow strait. The Causeway remains a major tourist draw today, contributing mightily to the economy of Northern Ireland. Over one million people visited it in 2017, bringing nearly half a billion pounds of revenue into the north coast region.\n Three more sites on Ithaca's list can be found in the southwestern part of Ireland, near Cork. \"Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle\" are coastal defense fortifications (now renamed Forts Meagher and Davis) guarding the great natural harbor at Queenstown (now Cobh), just beyond Cork on the southwest coast. The forts face one another on headlands on either side of a narrow strait, dominating access to the harbor. In Eumaeus, the garrulous sailor who says his name is Murphy says also that he comes from a town called Carrigaloe and challenges his listeners to say where that is. Stephen correctly identifies the town as being in \"Queenstown harbour,\" and Murphy confirms his answer by bragging about a local claim to fame: \"That's right, the sailor said. Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle. That's where I hails from. I belongs there. That's where I hails from.\"\n Some 40 or 50 miles northeast of Cork lies \"the Golden Vale of Tipperary\" (sometimes called the golden \"vein\"), a stretch of rich pastureland north of the Galtee Mountains that occupies parts of Counties Tipperary, Limerick, and Cork. It is about 15 miles long and half that wide. The adjective \"golden\" may refer to the fertility of its soil, said to be the richest in Ireland, or it could be a corruption of Gowlin (Irish An Gabhailín), a village that itself is now called Golden. Pastures and dairy farms fill the valley.\n West of Cork, some 50 or 60 miles away in County Kerry, are \"the lakes of Killarney,\" set in a low valley surrounded by mountains. This varied and spectacularly beautiful landscape is now protected as Killarney National Park. Its three \"lovely lakes\" are mentioned also in Cyclops. In Wandering Rocks Stephen sees a Pocket Guide to Killarney on a bookseller's cart, and Gabler's edition places a copy ofThe Beauties of Killarney on Bloom's bookshelf in Ithaca.The perpetual appeal of this area, largely wild but also comfortably human-scaled, makes the nearby town of Killarney a touristic hellhole in the summer months.\n Finally, the list mentions three natural attractions close to Dublin. The \"pastures of royal Meath\" are another rich stretch of agricultural land in County Meath, named for the ancient Kingdom of Meath which for many centuries was the seat of the High King. These attractive green rolling hills around the River Boyne, several miles northwest of Dublin, are studded with sites of archeological interest: the Hill of Tara, megalithic passage tombs like the one at Newgrange, and many other artifacts of the Neolithic age, including mounds, henges, cairns, and tombs.\n \"Brigid's elm in Kildare\" is a puzzle. It is said that in the late 5th century St. Brigid, one of three patron saints of Ireland, lived in a cell beneath a large tree and founded a famous religious house there, possibly in the vicinity of what is now the town of Kildare, 30 miles southwest of Dublin. But the tree was not an elm—the town and county name derive from the Irish Cilldara, \"Church of the Oak\"—and if any such tree has survived to become a tourist destination I have not heard of it. The Citizen's reference in Cyclops to \"the chieftain elm of Kildare with a fortyfoot bole and an acre of foliage\" seems to refer to the same thing but begs the same questions. If this immense tree exists, no one seems to have documented its location, and the elm, Gifford notes, was a \"common,\" not a \"chieftain,\" tree. He infers that \"the one in question was not renowned for the chieftain associated with it but for St. Brigid, a chieftain's daughter.\" \n The last of these three eastern sites, \"the Salmon Leap,\" is a waterfall on the River Liffey at Leixlip, about 10 miles west of Dublin on the border of Counties Kildare and Dublin. The name Leixlip derives from the Norse words lax hlaup, meaning \"salmon leap.\" Many artists have drawn or painted these low but picturesque falls. \n Ithaca's list of tourist attractions not only evokes the lands and waters around Ireland's four major cities: Dublin, Cork, Belfast, and Galway. It also shows the protagonist of Ulysses taking a good deal more interest in his native country than does the character whose meditations conclude Dubliners. Gabriel Conroy dreams of trips to the Continent, and scorns Gretta's appeals to visit her native Galway—until the revelation of her interest in another man convinces him that \"The time had come for him to set out on his journey westward.\" His thoughts of snow falling on the Bog of Allen, and the River Shannon, and the churchyard in Galway where Michael Furey is buried, are incomparably lyrical, but they are thoughts of death. Gabriel resolves to go west in a spirit of defeat, feeling that the loss of his love portends the extinction of his life: \"His own identity was fading out into a grey impalpable world: the solid world itself which these dead had one time reared and lived in was dissolving and dwindling.\"\n Ithaca comically presents the possibility of Bloom becoming an aged, homeless, disrespected beggar, but this jilted husband does not scorn his native land or dream of death through snow-misted images. The thought of losing Molly terrifies him, but he also thinks with characteristic equanimity that it could present a long-postponed opportunity to see the world, starting with the wonders of a pretty remarkable island."

  "030046lochlanns": {
    "note": " Looking out to sea in Proteus, Stephen casts his thoughts back eleven centuries, to the time of the first Viking invasions of Ireland: \"Galleys of the Lochlanns ran here to beach, in quest of prey, their bloodbeaked prows riding low on a molten pewter surf.\" Lochlann (land of the lochs, i.e. the fjords of Norway), a Gaelic name preserved to the present day in both Ireland and Scotland, refers to the first Viking raiders and settlers of Ireland, in the last decade of the 8th century and the first decades of the 9th. At about the same time, other invaders from what is now Denmark began settling Britain, and in 853 these new Scandinavians arrived in Ireland. Stephen thinks of them in the next breath: \"Dane vikings, torcs of tomahawks aglitter on their breasts when Malachi wore the collar of gold.\"",
    "expandedNote": " In a lecture titled \"Ireland, Island of Saints and Sages\" (1907), Joyce observed that \"Anyone who reads the history of the three centuries that precede the coming of the English must have a strong stomach, because the internecine strife, and the conflicts with the Danes and the Norwegians, the black foreigners and the white foreigners, as they were called, follow each other so continuously and ferociously that they make this entire era a veritable slaughterhouse. The Danes occupied all the principal ports on the east coast of the island and established a kingdom at Dublin.\" \n The invaders possessed the most formidable warships of the time: light, slender, flexible, and shallow-drafting galleys that could cut the seas swiftly, venture up rivers, and land on beaches. As Gifford notes, the Danes also had \"metal bodyarmor (coats of mail and helmets with visors)\" that the Gaels could not match. He speculates that \"torcs of tomahawks aglitter on their breasts\" refers to a device of reversed battle-axes that the Danes often wore on top of their mail coats."

  "060027loftycone": {
    "note": " Simon Dedalus remarks on \"The O'Connell circle,\" while Jack Power sends his gaze \"up to the apex of the lofty cone.\" Daniel O'Connell's body (sans heart) has been buried in two different places: for the first two decades in a raised circle of earth near the center of the Glasnevin cemetery, and afterwards in a tower near the mortuary chapel on the edge of the cemetery.",
    "expandedNote": " Since these two sites are not adjacent, it seems possible that Joyce made a mistake in having two characters refer to them as if they are. Another possibility is that Dedalus may be referring to the grounds around the tower, rather than to the raised circle in the center of the cemetery. As the last of the photos here shows, the tower is surrounded by a circular patch of turf, with a circular path at its circumference. Perhaps this is what Dedalus calls the \"The O'Connell circle\"?\n In 1869 O'Connell's remains were moved from the raised circle at the center of the cemetery to a crypt at the base of a 168-foot monument, modeled on medieval Irish round towers, that had been under construction since 1855. Such glorification befits this champion of Catholic rights who worked to establish a cemetery in which Catholics and Protestants alike could be buried with the full rites of their respective faiths. \n The tower originally housed spiral stairs allowing visitors to climb to the top, but it was bombed by loyalists in 1971, perhaps in reprisal for the 1966 bombing of Nelson's pillar by the IRA. The three-foot-thick granite walls of the tower survived, but the staircase was destroyed. The Glasnevin Trust has raised funds and received permission to rebuild the stairs, in a double helix pattern that will allow people to pass both up and down without difficulty. Since Glasnevin itself sits at 110 feet above sea level, the view from another 150 feet up promises to be spectacular."

  "050006looplinebridge": {
    "note": " The \"Loop Line bridge\" is a heavy railroad bridge that crosses the Liffey on the east side of central Dublin, continuing over city streets on the north side to the Amiens Street station and on the south side to the Westland Row station. It was built in 1891 to connect train lines on the two sides of the city, \"looping\" between the two stations in a large arc. Its elevated structure, occasioned by the need for ships and city traffic to pass beneath it, spoiled views of the large, handsome neoclassical building just to the northeast: the Custom House.",
    "expandedNote": " This prominent Dublin feature is first mentioned in Lotus Eaters, when the elegant woman whom Bloom has been ogling, waiting for her to climb up on a jaunting car and reveal glimpses of her underwear, rides off \"towards the Loop Line bridge.\" The \"bridge\" here is quite a few blocks from the water, passing over Great Brunswick Street on its way to the nearby Westland Row (now Pearse) railway station, where it terminates.\n One chapter later, in Hades, the carriage in which Bloom is riding along Great Brunswick (now Pearse) Street passes \"under the railway bridge\" near Westland Row station. In the space between the two chapters Bloom has traveled southeast to Paddy Dignam's house in Sandymount, and is now revisiting the area he walked through before. \n The bridge proper (that is, the part that crosses the river) figures in Wandering Rocks, when the throwaway which Bloom has thrown away on the O'Connell Street bridge drifts past its pilings: \"A skiff, a crumpled throwaway, Elijah is coming, rode lightly down the Liffey, under Loopline bridge, shooting the rapids where water chafed around the bridgepiers, sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains, between the Customhouse old dock and George's quay.\" In 1904 oceangoing ships moored both upstream and downstream of the Loop Line bridge, navigating past the immediately adjacent Butt Bridge by virtue of its swiveling central section.\n The action of Eumaeus takes place under the northern part of the bridge, behind the Custom House. Stephen and Bloom, we hear, \"made a beeline across the back of the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge where a brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one attracted their rather lagging footsteps.\" This is the post of Gumley, guarding the Corporation's stones. \n From the nearby cabman's shelter, Bloom sees the old sailor Murphy \"gaping up at the piers and girders of the Loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was all radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved.\" Bloom, then, is much in favor of this recent feat of mechanical engineering in service of railway connectivity, accomplished during Murphy's long absence. He does not seem to be bothered by any aesthetic violence it may have done to the Georgian cityscape. \n At its northern end, the bridge runs into the Amiens Street (now Connolly) station, the departure point for northbound trains. This station too is mentioned in Eumaeus and Ithaca."

  "180006lordbyron": {
    "note": " The Romantic-era poet George Gordon, \"Lord Byron\" (1778-1824), figured in the erotic imaginations of both Blooms during their courtship: Leopold gave Molly a book of Byron's poems, and both she and he seem to have fancied that he possessed some likeness to the famous poet. But Byron's influence on Ulysses goes deeper than this. One of his early lyric poems describes the power of erotic kisses in ways that strongly shape a reader's understanding of Bloom, Molly, Stephen, and Joyce himself. The opening stanzas of Don Juan shed light on Joyce's decision to make his first erotic encounter with Nora the foundation of a new fictional world.",
    "expandedNote": " Molly came into her relationship with Bloom liking poetry and imagining that this new man in her life might bear some resemblance to the poet who notoriously embodied sexual ardor: \"I always liked poetry when I was a girl first I thought he was a poet like lord Byron and not an ounce of it in his composition I thought he was quite different.\" Bloom appears to have played along with Molly's fantasy, and his looks helped: \"he was very handsome at that time trying to look like Lord Byron I said I liked though he was too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged.\" Ithaca observes that Bloom, caught up perhaps in this mutual focus on his Byronic potential, sent a romantic lyric to Molly on Valentine's Day, 1888 that emphasized her affectionate name for him. It does not proclaim the second coming of Lord Byron:\n Poets oft have sung in rhyme\n Of music sweet their praise divine.\n Let them hymn it nine times nine.\n Dearer far than song or wine,\n You are mine. The world is mine. \n Molly also remembers, in Penelope, that Bloom gave her a book of Byron's poems when they were arguing: \"after that I pretended I had a coolness on with her over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you going to and I said over to Floey and he made me the present of Byrons poems and the three pairs of gloves so that finished that I could quite easily get him to make it up any time.\" \n Ulysses does not record the name of the book, but Byron's first published collection, Hours of Idleness (1807), contains a poem called \"The First Kiss of Love\" that seems powerfully relevant to Molly and Bloom. (It also features a poem titled “To Marion.”) In seven quatrains, \"First Kiss\" praises the experience of new sexual passion as an authentic inspiration for poetry that far surpasses the influence of stale artistic conventions:\n Away with your fictions of flimsy romance; \n Those tissues of falsehood which folly has wove! \n Give me the mild beam of the soul-breathing glance, \n Or the rapture which dwells on the first kiss of love. \n Ye rhymers, whose bosoms with phantasy glow, \n Whose pastoral passions are made for the grove; \n From what blest inpiration your sonnets would flow, \n Could you ever have tasted the first kiss of love! \n If Apollo should e'er his assistance refuse, \n Or the Nine be disposed from your service to rove, \n Invoke them no more, bid adieu to the muse, \n And try the effect of the first kiss of love. \n I hate you, ye cold compositions of art! \n Though prudes may condemn me, and bigots reprove, \n I court the effusions that spring from the heart, \n Which throbs with delight to the first kiss of love. \n Your shepherds, your flocks, those fantastical themes, \n Perhaps may amuse, yet they never can move: \n Arcadia displays but a region of dreams: \n What are visions like these to the first kiss of love? \n Oh! cease to affirm that man, since his birth, \n From Adam till now, has with wretchedness strove, \n Some portion of paradise still is on earth, \n And Eden revives in the first kiss of love. \n When age chills the blood, when our pleasures are past— \n For years fleet away with the wings of the dove— \n The dearest remembrance will still be the last, \n Our sweetest memorial the first kiss of love. \n Byron's description of the physical energy of the kisses—\"effusions that spring from the heart, / Which throbs with delight\"—makes clear that these are embraces of a passionately carnal sort, like those represented later in the 19th century by Rodin, Munch, and Toulouse-Lautrec. But he also uses religious language to characterize their spiritual power. New love is \"soul-breathing,\" a \"rapture,\" a \"blest inspiration\" which shows that \"Some portion of paradise is still on earth.\" The allusion in stanza 6 to mankind's fall from Eden, with its recognition that only \"Some\" of the original perfection can \"still\" be glimpsed, introduces the thought of the final stanza, that within individual lives too there is a falling away. Rapturous sexual \"pleasures\" belong to hot-blooded youth, because (in an echo of Psalm 55:6) \"years fleet away with the wings of the dove.\" First kisses do not remain in one's experience, but they do endure in memory: the \"dearest remembrance\" of older years, \"Our sweetest memorial,\" will be the flaring passion we experienced in youth.\n The poem is clearly relevant to Molly's memories. Although she seems almost as addicted as Gerty MacDowell to \"fictions of flimsy romance,\" when left alone with her thoughts what stirs her is the passion of a \"first kiss.\" The lyrical rapture that closes Ulysses blends her memory of kissing Mulvey in Gibraltar with the memory of kissing Bloom on Howth Head: \"my God after that long kiss I near lost my breath.\" Such kisses, she thinks, possess an intensity that dissipates in long-term relationships: \"its only the first time after that its just the ordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man without going and marrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help yourself I wish some man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul almost paralyses you.\"\n Bloom too looks back on the picnic on Howth Head as a kind of lost paradise. His recollections in Lestrygonians are sadder than Molly's, but no less rapturous: \"Coolsoft with ointments her hand touched me, caressed: her eyes upon me did not turn away. Ravished over her I lay, full lips full open, kissed her mouth. Yum. Softly she gave me in my mouth the seedcake warm and chewed. Mawkish pulp her mouth had mumbled sweet and sour with spittle. Joy: I ate it: joy. Young life, her lips that gave me pouting. Soft, warm, sticky gumjelly lips. Flowers her eyes were, take me, willing eyes. . . . Wildly I lay on her, kissed her: eyes, her lips, her stretched neck beating, woman's breasts full in her blouse of nun's veiling, fat nipples upright. Hot I tongued her. She kissed me. I was kissed. All yielding she tossed my hair. Kissed, she kissed me.\"\n The eyes gazing on Bloom, the hand caressing him, the sense of rapture, undoubtedly derive from Joyce's memory of his first date with Nora, when she took the sexual initiative and caressed him to orgasm. In a letter he wrote to her years later, Joyce recalled that evening in Ringsend when she \"first led the way\" by reaching into his pants, \"all the time bending over me and gazing at me out of your quiet saintlike eyes.\" In another letter he called Nora the girl who \"took me so easily into her arms and made me a man.\" He was overwhelmed by the realization of what sex could be with a woman who somehow evaded, or combined, the Catholic dualities of fallen woman and saint.\n In Proteus Stephen wishes for the same experience. Walking on the strand not far from where Jim found delight with Nora, he longs for someone to \"Touch me. Soft eyes. Soft soft soft hand.\" Knowing nothing but sexless Catholic icons and prostitutes, however, he cannot imagine a kiss like the one that dwells in the memories of Molly and Bloom. A few paragraphs earlier, seeking inspiration for a poem, he concocted a fantasy of a kiss that was itself inspired by a poem, meriting Byron's condemnation of art that is sterile because it knows only art. Moreover, it involves a prostitute meeting a man who \"comes, pale vampire, through storm his eyes, his bat sails bloodying the sea, mouth to her mouth's kiss.\" The association between love and nutrition seen in Bloom's recollection of the seedcake here is inverted into a vampirish draining of life. \n § Joyce famously set his masterpiece on the day when he walked out to Ringsend with Nora, and his sense of the importance of that date points to still more Byronic influence. In a note titled \"Byron's Don Juan and Joyce's Ulysses,\" James Joyce Quarterly 29.4 (1992): 829-33, which argues that Byron's ottava rima comic epic exerted great influence on Ulysses, Walter E. Anderson quotes from the first canto, where Byron narrates the beginning of the amour between Don Juan and Donna Julia:\n 'Twas on a summer's day—the sixth of June—\n I like to be particular in dates, \n Not only of the age, and year, but moon; \n They are a sort of post-house, where the Fates \n Change horses, making history change its tune. (1.103)\n James Joyce too liked to be particular in dates, and Ulyssesshows his fascination with crucial moments when lives can track a new course. Anderson infers that he must have been struck by the coincidence of June 6 and June 16, and he quotes more lines from Don Juan which may have further inspired Joyce to make his date with Nora a date that changed the tune of history: \"June the sixth (that fatal day / Without whose epoch my poetic skill / For want of facts would all be thrown away)\" (1.121). Byron here reiterates his sense of the date's cosmic importance and returns to the lyric poem's theme of basing literary art on actual human experience, \"facts.\" Several lines later, he recalls another motif from \"The First Kiss of Love,\" its fancy that new erotic passion is a taste of Edenic perfection which outshines all the later events of a life:\n But sweeter still than this, than these, than all,\n Is first and passionate love—it stands alone, \n Like Adam's recollection of his fall; \n The tree of knowledge has been pluck'd—all's known—\n And life yields nothing further to recall. (1.127) \n Anderson leads off his brief article with these passages about newfound love, but he seems chiefly interested in the ways that Byron may have inspired Joyce to write an irreverent, densely contemporaneous version of ancient epic poetry: \"Seminal as is the suggestion of a fateful day of seduction in June, it seems at least equalled in importance by other basic propositions\" (830). This may be true, but the importance to Joyce of the life-altering effect of sexual delight should never be underestimated. Not only do all three principal characters of Ulysses show the unmistakable imprint of \"The First Kiss of Love,\" but the novel itself is founded upon the author's experience of a kiss that set his life upon a new course. \n In Part 2 of A Portrait of the Artist (85-86), Stephen endures a pummeling by bullies rather than recant his high esteem for Byron's poetry. His classmates object to Byron primarily on moral grounds: \"Byron was a heretic and immoral too\"; \"Byron was a bad man\"; \"Byron was no good.\" Stephen maintains his aesthetic judgment that Byron is the greatest English poet (one that Joyce shared even in later life, according to Ellmann) despite his notorious philandering. There is a kind of ironic triumph in knowing that in Ulysses Joyce values Byron in large part because of his enthusiastic celebration of erotic passion."

  "030092losdemiurgos": {
    "note": " Cracking along on his feet, tapping shells and sand with his cane, Stephen thinks, \"Sounds solid: made by the mallet of Los Demiurgos. Am I walking into eternity along Sandymount strand?\" The eternal principles here are supplied by William Blake, who conceived of \"Los, the creator\" as the earthly form of one of the Four Zoas (the primal faculties), and by Plato, who conceived of a δημιουργός (demiourgos) or \"creator\" that fashioned the visible world. Stephen's idea of \"walking into eternity\" was probably directly inspired by reading Blake.",
    "expandedNote": " Timaeus, in Plato's dialogue of the same name, says that a demiurge formed the world that we see about us. This deity acts from benevolent intentions in the Timaeus, fashioning the cosmos to be as good \"as possible\" (30b), as much like the eternal Ideas as \"necessity\" will allow (47e-48a). Later Gnostic works, by contrast, depicted the Demiurge as a demon whose creative work is evil, trapping mankind within the realm of matter. The Platonic position, it should be noted, is much closer to the Christian view that the world was made by a beneficent Creator who found his work to be \"good.\" \n Blake's Los, mentioned in The Book of Urizen, The Book of Los, America a Prophecy, Europe a Prophecy (all mid-1790s), and Jerusalem (1804-20), is also a creator, and like the Demiurge he inhabits an intermediary plane between the visible and eternal worlds. He is the fallen human form of Urthona, one of the Four Zoas. Blake represents him as a smith beating his hammer on an anvil (associated with the beating of the human heart) and blowing the fire with large bellows (associated with the lungs). He creates life, sexual reproduction, and consciousness, and as the begetter of Adam he originates the line of biblical patriarchs and prophets. \n Thornton notes that, in a 1912 lecture, Joyce referred almost verbatim to a characterization of Los in yet another of Blake's works, Milton (1804-10): \"For every Space larger than a red globule of Man's blood / Is visionary, and is created by the Hammer of Los.\" And, indeed, Stephen seems to be regarding the work of Los in Proteus as an occasion for \"visionary\" enlightenment, just as he drew on the works of Jakob Boehme andGeorge Berkeley to read the sights of the seashore as \"signatures\" or \"signs\" of noumenal reality.\n It is hard to know how many of Blake's works Joyce may be drawing on, but the lecture suggests that at the very least he was thinking of Milton. That work seems to have supplied Stephen with his idea of walking into eternity, which follows hard upon the mention of Los. Blake describes how Milton entered him through his left foot: \"And all this Vegetable World appear'd on my left Foot / As a bright sandal form'd immortal of precious stones & gold. / I stoop'd down & bound it on to walk forward thro' Eternity\" (I, plate 21). \n Blake also connects Los with a large pair of compasses, suggesting the architectonic work of drafting the plan of creation. In a famous plate, he represented Urizen as the Ancient of Days extending an opened compass into the dark void beneath him. Urizen and Los are opponents in Blake's early works, each trapping the other within a human body. Does their opposition (constructed as a binary of reason and imagination, repression and revolution, denial of human passions and gratification of them) somehow reinstantiate the ancient debate about the goodness or evil of the created world? Gifford notes that, \"in Gnostic theory and Theosophy,\" the Demiurge was called \"the architect of the world.\" \n These debates do not surface in Stephen's thoughts, but they do beg the question of how he may conceive the \"Demiurgos\": is it a force for repression and ignorance, or for liberation and insight? No certain conclusions can be drawn from such brief utterances, but Stephen's belief that he can access eternity through the created world does not seem to bespeak a Gnostic sensibility. It associates him instead with the view articulated by Plato—and, later, by the early Christians—that the Creation is good."

    "note": " Walking on the battered and rotted remains of old ships and boats—\"wood sieved by the shipworm\"—Stephen turns his thoughts from the disaster of his own past to a national disaster: the ruination of Spain's great \"Armada,\" which helped England to become an imperial power, the ruler of the waves.",
    "expandedNote": " Catholic Spain was the great European power of the 16th century. Harassed during the reign of the Protestant Queen Elizabeth by small English privateers in the Atlantic and by English armies in the Low Countries, the Spanish assembled a huge fleet (130 vessels) to crush England's military power and topple its government. The fleet rendezvoused off the coast of England in August 1588 but was driven into disarray by an attack of English fire-ships and withdrew to the north, with English ships in pursuit. Attempting to return to Spain by sailing around Scotland and Ireland, the fleet encountered fierce storms and lost about four dozen ships. More than two dozen washed up along Ireland's western shore. Stephen entertains the logical possibility that some of the countless bits of driftwood in Dublin Bay may be from those lost ships.\n Irish national history preserves the memory of other catastrophic failures of continental naval powers to dislodge the English colonizers. In Telemachus, Mulligan mentions that the tower at Sandycove was built \"when the French were on the sea,\" during the nationwide rebellion of 1796-98 when French fleets attepted to land armies on Irish soil. One failed to land in bad weather; a second landed troops who were quickly defeated in battle; a third was defeated at sea by the Royal Navy. In Aeolus, professor MacHugh remarks proudy that \"We are liege subjects of the catholic chivalry of Europe that foundered at Trafalgar\" in 1805, invoking still another memory of French and Spanish fleets crushed by the Royal Navy.\n [2015] In 1912 Joyce published a rambling essay in Il Picolo della Sera of Trieste which is translated in The Critical Writings as \"The Mirage of the Fisherman of Aran. England's Safety Valve in Case of War.\" From the vantage of a boat leaving Galway harbor, it observes that \"Beneath the waters of this bay and along its coast lie the wrecks of a squadron of the unfortunate Spanish Armada. After their defeat in the English Channel, the ships set sail for the North, where the storms and waves scattered them. The citizens of Galway, remembering the long friendship between Spain and Ireland, hid the fugitives from the vengeance of the English garrison and gave the shipwrecked a decent burial, wrapping their bodies in white linen cloth.\""

    "note": " Imagining the girl next door seeking salvation from a constable, Bloom plays wittily on the name of her employer, Mr. Woods: \"O please, Mr Policeman, I'm lost in the wood.\" His conceit alludes to two staples of popular culture. The traditional children's story Babes in the Wood is one that he might have encountered either in pantomimes or in Mother Goose nursery rhymes. He combines its picture of frightened children lost in the forest with a music-hall song, Oh Please, Mr. P'liceman, about country girls lost in the big city.",
    "expandedNote": " Babes in the Wood, originally published as a broadsheet ballad in 1595, is the story of two small children left in the care of their uncle after their parents die. To steal their inheritance, the uncle sends them off with a pair of murderers, one of whom kills the other and leaves the children to fend for themselves in the woods. They die, and birds cover their bodies with leaves. \n Oh Please, Mr. P'liceman presents a less dire predicament. Gifford and Seidman identify the song as one \"written by E. Andrews and popularized in the 1890s by the Tillie Sisters.\" They publish these lyrics:\n To London Town we came, you know, a week ago today,\n And 'tis the first time we've been out, and quickly lost our way;\n We got somewhere near Leicester Square, when a p'liceman bold \n Cried out, \"Move on!\" and how he laughed as we our story told.\n (Chorus)\n Oh, please, Mr. P'liceman, do be good to us;\n We've not been long in London, and we want to take a 'bus.\n They told us we could go by 'bus to Pimlico, \n Oh, what wicked Place is London—Oh! Oh! Oh!\n This was not the only music-hall song about unhelpful policemen. In Popular Music in England, 1840-1914: A Social History (McGill-Queen's UP, 1987), Dave Russell observes that \"Policemen seem to have featured in music-hall song from at least the late 1860s,\" often as objects of scorn (101). Nor was it the only such song to entertain audiences with stories of country bumpkins daunted by their city cousins.\n Please, Sir, I've Lost My Way, performed by Vesta Tilley, is the song of a Lincolnshire villager who feels \"a little green\" in the big city. He is approached by a woman who says that she too has lost her way in the city and needs help. A policeman appears; the woman suddenly accuses her savior of insulting and threatening her; the policeman threatens to haul him away and teach him better manners; he offers to give the policeman all his possessions to avoid the beating; the policeman takes his watch, his chain, and his purse. When the man finds another policeman and tells him the story, the constable at first laughs, and then tells him that he has been victimized by a pair of swindlers that the police are looking for. And now, \"I'm chaffed by all who know it, by my friends, both far and near, / And even cheeky barmaids when they serve me smile and jeer.\"\n The theme of laughter in these songs—knowing city dwellers enjoying themselves at the expense of naive recent arrivals—cuts the melodramatic pathos of Babes in the Wood. Bloom clearly is not too worried about the sexual vulnerability of his neighbor's servant, the girl who wears \"Brown scapulars in tatters, defending her both ways.\" Herself perhaps a recent arrival from the country, she goes in the same mental pigeonhole as redheaded curates from the county Leitrim and burly policemen."

  "050000lotuseaters": {
    "note": " Like Stephen's second chapter, the second of Bloom's three morning chapters shows him outside of his domicile, making his way in the world of human society. In another echo of Nestor, the time frame is approximately 9:30 to 10:30 AM. The episode that Joyce called \"Lotus Eaters\" begins the saga of Bloom's daylong journey through Dublin with a sustained meditation on drugs and other tactics for avoiding reality, inspired by some two dozen lines of Homer's poem in which several of Odysseus' men fall under the spell of a narcotic plant and must be forcibly re-conscripted. In the context of what he has learned about Molly and Blazes Boylan in Calypso, this analogue has clear application to Bloom.",
    "expandedNote": " As always, Joyce adapted the Homeric story very freely. The first sentence of the chapter makes Bloom an Odysseus figure, keeping his wits about him as others lose theirs: \"By lorries along sir John Rogerson's quay Mr Bloom walked soberly.\" In the third paragraph he thinks of people in Ceylon who \"Sleep six months out of twelve,\" which Gifford attributes to a Greek mythological belief that \"the Lotus-Eaters slept half the year.\" But the previous chapter has shown that Bloom has his own harsh reality to avoid and his own avoidance mechanisms. In Lotus Eaters he seems to be trying to think about anything but his wife's coming infidelity, while his entire world seems to be conspiring to remind him of it. \n In the Odyssey, most of the wanderings of the protagonist are narrated retrospectively. Odysseus sails away from Calypso's island in Book 5 and washes up on the shore of the Phaeacians, where the princess Nausicaa finds him half-drowned. (If Joyce had been slavishly following the sequence of Homer's events, Nausicaa would have been his fifth chapter rather than his thirteenth.) Received hospitably into the palace of Nausicaa's father, Odysseus tells his hosts of the various adventures that befell him on the long way from Troy to Ogygia. \n The second of these adventures, narrated in Book 9, tells of \"the coastline of the Lotos Eaters, / who live upon that flower.\" Three of Odysseus' men scouted the land, encountering natives who offered no hostility but only a sample of their favorite food. Tasting it, the Ithacans \"never cared to report, nor to return: / they longed to stay forever, browsing on / that native bloom, forgetful of their homeland.\" Odysseus felt compelled to drive them back to their ships and secure them under the rowing benches, admonishing the others to shove off or \"lose your hope of home.\" \n Since Calypso has taken place in Bloom's home, Lotus Eaters marks the beginning of his wanderings, and much of what he thinks in the chapter stands juxtaposed against what he has just left. If his \"hope of home\" has been shaken by Boylan's letter, other Dubliners have far less to stake their hopes on. Several sentences into the chapter he sees an impoverished boy \"smoking a chewed fagbutt\" and considers warning him about the dangers of tobacco, but then thinks of his family: \"Tell him if he smokes he won't grow. O let him! His life isn't such a bed of roses. Waiting outside pubs to bring da home. Come home to ma, da.\" Countless Dublin homes have been blighted by alcohol—but later chapters will show that Bloom has evaded this habit, to the benefit of his family.\n Tobacco and alcohol (and opium, also mentioned in the chapter) make hard lives more bearable but exact a heavy price. So too do various non-chemical fixes to which Bloom seems immune: militaristic patriotic fervor, mesmerizing religious rituals, the alluring greed of betting on horses. Some milder indulgences clearly appeal to him: drinking tea, dreaming of warmer climates, lusting after women who are not his wife. But these tender seductions are less dangerous than Bloom's determination not to think seriously about the marriage problems that are driving his wife to commit adultery. At one point in the chapter he envies castrated horses their freedom from sexual desire. At another he discounts the value of communication between spouses: \"Talk: as if that would mend matters.\" \n Hugh Kenner argues that this chapter presents a man who is \"virtually in shock\" (Ulysses, 51): \"In a state of near-nescience, Bloom is wandering almost at random, thinking of everything but the main thing he found out an hour before, that Boylan will cuckold him this afternoon. This he must not dwell on\" (22). Ian Gunn and Clive Hart note that \"The meanderings which follow his initial appearance on the quay are like the aimless wanderings of a drugged and troubled man, Bloom's demeanour suggesting, indeed, that he may not be fully conscious of what he is doing\" (James Joyce's Dublin, 34-35). Scholars have noted that Bloom's steps trace the shape of a giant question mark. In his earlier Topographical Guide (1976), Hart observes that he actually tramps out two question marks, the second one begun when he detours all the way around the Westland Row post office to end mere feet from where he began.\n Joyce's two schemas continue the disagreement they showed about the times of Stephen's second and third chapters: Gilbert's has Lotus Eaters starting at 10 AM, while Linati's says 9. Neither can be correct, because unnarrated actions occur both before and after those represented in the chapter. After the conclusion of Calypso at 8:45, Bloom pays one more visit to his wife in her bedroom and then travels southeast a little more than a mile from his house to the docklands. Lotus Eaters could not begin earlier than about 9:30. After the conclusion of the chapter, Bloom visits the Turkish baths that he has been thinking about and then continues his southeasterly travels to Sandymount, where he joins the funeral party at about 11:00. So the chapter could not end much later than 10:30.\n Clive Hart observes that Bloom's journey of a little over a mile between Calypso and Lotus Eaters corresponds closely in time and distance to the one that Stephen takes between Telemachus and Nestor and predicts the walk that he and Stephen will take at the end of the novel, from the same area near the Liffey docks back to Bloom's house on Eccles Street: \"The initial and final parts of the odyssey, the outward and inward journeys, are thus made to form a perfect symmetry\" (James Joyce's Dublin, 34)."

  "170017loudlonecrack": {
    "note": " As Bloom sits in his parlor, about to rise and enter the adjoining bedroom, he contemplates three minor mysteries: a \"selfimposed enigma,\" a \"selfinvolved enigma,\" and a \"selfevident enigma.\" The first is self-imposed because it \"involuntarily\" impacts his thoughts: a wooden table in the parlor emits \"a brief sharp unforeseen heard loud lone crack.\" Bloom's curiosity about the \"cause\" of this noise invites comparison to a moment in Homer's Odyssey when a thunderclap is taken for evidence of divine approval. But it is also productive to ask why he is searching out mysteries at this particular time: could it be that he is none too eager to climb into bed with Molly?",
    "expandedNote": " Gifford suggests an allusion to the end of Book 21 of the epic poem, when Odysseus strings his mighty bow and prepares to slaughter the suitors. In the Robert Fitzgerald translation from which he quotes, the verbal echo is particularly strong: \"Then Zeus thundered / overhead, one loud crack for a sign. / And Odysseus laughed within him that the son / of crooked minded Kronos had flung that omen down.\" \"Coincidentally,\" Gifford notes, Carl Jung acquired a sense of spiritual purpose and began his search for numinous archetypes within the human psyche when he heard two \"loud cracks\" from pieces of furniture in the summer of 1898. \n Joyce was reading some of Jung's work when he wrote Ulysses, but this personal anecdote apparently first appeared in print in the early 1960s (in Memories, Dreams, Reflections), and the two men first met in the 1930s—so, intriguing as the coincidence may be, there is little reason to suppose that it informs the passage in Ithaca. Leaving aside Jung's odd experience, though, the echo of the Odyssey, in a chapter teeming with such echoes, is sufficiently strong to introduce the notion that divinity can declare its presence in mundane sounds. In Nestor Stephen called God \"A shout in the street.\" Similar deities might manifest themselves in cracking timbers.\n The evocation of supernatural support, if such it is, comes just after what Gifford calls Bloom's \"prayerful\" review of his day, in which various events have symbolically enacted Jewish religious rituals. If quotidian occurrences like making breakfast, going to work, listening to music, and masturbating may affirm a divine order, then the release of tension in a piece of \"strainveined timber\" may well do the same thing. The narrator encourages such a reading by inserting the word \"unforeseen\" into his long list of crisp monosyllables (\"a brief sharp unforeseen heard loud lone crack\"), and by mentioning that the sound has been produced by \"insentient material.\" Inanimate objects produce sounds all the time, so why call attention to the fact unless to suggest that something extraordinary is happening? And saying that the event was unforeseen places it in the context of divine omens that men cannot anticipate.\n It's quite reasonable, then, to suppose that Joyce here is encouraging his Odyssean hero to move forward with killing the suitors—an action which he will shortly perform in a remarkably nonviolent way, by examining his \"antagonistic sentiments\" toward the adultery (envy, jealousy, abnegation, equanimity), considering possible responses to it, and choosing acceptance rather than rage. For several hundred pages now, the novel has employed Homeric analogies to suggest that Bloom may prove to be a heroic individual: standing up to the Citizen, reclaiming his manhood from Bella Cohen, acting as a father to Stephen. If he can now master the longstanding sexual anxiety that Molly has brought to the surface and forced him to confront, June 16 may prove to have been a climacteric. \n All of this may be implied by the answer in this brief Q&A, but different notes are struck in the meandering question: \"What selfimposed enigma did Bloom about to rise in order to go so as to conclude lest he should not conclude involuntarily apprehend?\" However one construes the syntax and references of the central words here, they create a picture of irresolution. Bloom is \"about to rise\" from his chair in the parlor, but his meditation on the cause of the table's cracking noise stops him. Why was he about to rise? It was \"in order to go\" into the bedroom. Why was he going to go there? It was \"so as to conclude\" something. What was that something? His waking day? His understanding of what happened during it? His differences with Molly? His marriage? Whatever it was, he wished to conclude it \"lest he should not conclude.\" Etymologically, \"conclude\" means \"to shut completely.\" None of Bloom's thoughts about his wife, his marriage, or his sexuality come within a country mile of that condition. \n If the cracking timber does offer some hope that Bloom will succeed in the bedroom, it does so only within the context of his evident uncertainty, self-doubt, and hesitation. A similar mixture of anxiety and hope is implied by the allusion to a popular song in his final, \"selfevident enigma.\" Here at the outset of the triad, \"selfimposed\" probably refers chiefly to the fact that the sound intrudes on Bloom's consciousness irresistibly. But nothing in nature requires him to search for its \"cause,\" so it is Bloom too who is imposing the enigma on himself. Spending time on two more such mysteries before he departs for the bedroom—Who was McIntosh? Where was Moses when the light went out?—shows a reasoning mind in thrall to its emotions. Fear is the mother of procrastination."

Lough Owel is a glacial lake about four miles long, lying about four miles northwest of the town.",

The hotel is still luxuriously appointed, and still hosts concerts. \n Lough Owel offers opportunities for swimming, boating, trout fishing, and birdwatching. Gifford quotes \"Black's rather outspoken Tourist Guide to Ireland (Edinburgh, 1888)\" as saying that it is \"attractive but not overwhelming.\" He notes also that \"Picnics in the late nineteenth century were more formal and elaborate than they tend to be today; so a 'scrap picnic' is an exception, an informal, last-minute outing.\" \n Lough Owel and Lough Ennell, which is similar in size and lies at a similar distance southwest of Mullingar, are both part of the River Shannon drainage.

    "note": " After Mulligan tells Stephen to \"Give up the moody brooding\" about his mother's death, he quotes some apposite lines from a song in W. B. Yeats' play The Countess Kathleen: \"And no more turn aside and brood / Upon love’s bitter mystery.\" The song’s soothing images of shore and sea underline the gesture that Mulligan has just made toward the surrounding water: “Look at the sea. What does it care about offences?\" We learn within a few lines that Stephen too knows the song well, but for him it carries more troubling meanings in relation to his mother.",
    "expandedNote": " Kathleen (the spelling was changed to Cathleen in later versions) was first published in 1892 and first performed in 1899. Joyce attended the premiere. He did not care either for the play's overtly political agenda or for the political backlash against it (he refused to sign a student petition objecting to its disrespect for Christian doctrine). But, as Ellmann reports, he was deeply moved by the song; \"its feverish discontent and promise of carefree exile were to enter his own thought, and not long afterwards he set the poem to music and praised it as the best lyric in the world\" (67). The lyrics are sung to console the Countess, after she has sold her soul to the devil to relieve her starving tenants:\n Who will go drive with Fergus now,\n And pierce the deep wood’s woven shade,\n And dance upon the level shore?\n Young man, lift up your russet brow,\n And lift your tender eyelids, maid,\n And brood on hopes and fears no more.\n And no more turn aside and brood\n Upon love’s bitter mystery;\n For Fergus rules the brazen cars,\n And rules the shadow of the wood,\n And the white breast of the dim sea\n And all disheveled wandering stars. \n Stephen sang the song for his mother when she was dying, and phrases from it hover in his thoughts now: “Woodshadows” (in the following line of the novel) recalls Yeats’ “shadow of the wood,” and “White breast of the dim sea” (two lines after that) quotes from the song verbatim. Mulligan hears the poem's promise of happy release, but Stephen attends more to the anguished love that motivates the Countess. He recalls that when he had finished singing the song and playing its “long dark chords,” his mother “was crying in her wretched bed” for “those words, Stephen: love’s bitter mystery.” Love is a mystery which he has not begun to fathom but must learn, as both she and he know. Against Mulligan’s escape into hedonism, then, Stephen finds himself pulled toward deeper emotional engagement. \n As a figure of Christian piety, suffering, and martyrdom, Stephen's mother fills him with terror and guilt, and his brooding on her death is certainly unhealthy. But like Kathleen she has known the love that frees one from the tyranny of egoism. (After her death the countess is redeemed and ascends into heaven, because her apostasy sprang from generous motives.) Stephen must brood on this mystery."

    "note": " Molly tells her husband in Calypso that there will be two numbers on the \"programme\" for her upcoming concert tour. Mozart's lusty duet of sexual seduction will be paired with a sentimental celebration of enduring love, \"Love's Old Sweet Song.\" An English poet, G. Clifton Bingham, wrote the lyrics of this popular Victorian song, and the Irish composer James Lynam Molloy set them to music. Published in 1884 as sheet music, the song enjoyed great popularity in home parlors as well as on the concert stage.",
    "expandedNote": " The song begins with low notes supporting a verbal picture of some vaguely ancient time when \"mists began to fall\" on the world, but even as it mentions the mists the musical line is rising in pitch. With \"dreams that rose in happy throng,\" the music reaches a fourth above the beginning tonic (\"dreams\"), and then a fifth (\"throng\"). The feeling of happy confidence expressed in this rise continues into the beautiful melody of the chorus, where the fifth is attained twice more at \"twilight\" and \"weary,\" and then surpassed by a soaring sixth on the second iteration of \"twilight.\" The fifth returns once more at \"old song,\" and the final line of the song reaches up to a climactic octave.\n Once in the dear dead days beyond recall,\n When on the world the mists began to fall,\n Out of the dreams that rose in happy throng,\n Low to our hearts Love sang an old sweet song;\n And in the dusk where fell the firelight gleam\n Softly it wove itself into our dream.\n (Chorus)\n Just a song at twilight, when the lights are low,\n And the flick'ring shadows softly come and go;\n Though the heart be weary, sad the day and long,\n Still to us at twilight comes Love's old song,\n Comes Love's old sweet song.\n Even today we hear Love's song of yore,\n Deep in our heart it dwells forevermore;\n Footsteps may falter, weary grow the way,\n Still we can hear it at the close of day;\n So till the end, when life's dim shadows fall,\n Love will be found the sweetest song of all.\n (Chorus)\n Zack Bowen argues that this song \"tends to reenforce the image of the Boylan-Molly intimacy and is destined also to recur many times through the rest of the book, each time with the overtones of Molly's promiscuity\" (Musical Allusions in the Works of James Joyce, 87). It is hard to imagine how he could think this. With its appeal to a past so distant that it can barely be remembered, its evocation of a dream that survives deep in the heart, its mention of a long sad day that leaves the traveler weary, and its tender promise that Love will ultimately \"be found the sweetest song of all,\" Bingham's text seems tailor-made to suggest that an enduring love in the Blooms' relationship may overcome the transient flash of sexual excitement that Molly experiences with Boylan.\n The texts and emotional registers of Là ci darem and Love's Old Sweet Song could not be more different. Bowen is certainly right, though, about their pairing and their pervasive presence in the novel (nine and twelve mentions, respectively). One cannot adequately read Ulysseswithout having the tunes of many songs run through one's brain whenever they appear in the text. These two in particular are so central that they could be called the theme songs of Ulysses. Their interplay initiates and sustains an uncertainty about the outcome of Molly's affair that carries into her monologue in Penelope.\n When Bloom returns home in Ithaca, the piano in his parlor has a copy of Love's Old Sweet Song on the musicrest. Its title page lists not only the composer, the lyricist, and the key, but also \"Madam Antoinette Sterling,\" an American contralto with a big, rich voice. Sterling gave many concerts in England in the 1870s and 80s, moving in her later years from oratorios and lieder to sentimental ballads like Molloy's. She was immensely popular.\n In Penelope Molly hears a long train whistle whose \"frseeeeeeeefronnnng\" makes her think of \"the end of Loves old sweeeetsonnnng.\" She is thinking of the last two syllables of the chorus: \"sweet,\" given two simple eighth notes in the score, often lends itself to melismatic elaboration, and \"song\" occupies the space of a whole note. Later she hears the train again and thinks of the song in more detail: \"Frseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeefrong that train again weeping tone once in the dear deaead days beyond recall close my eyes breath my lips forward kiss sad look eyes open piano ere oer the world the mists began I hate that istsbeg comes loves sweet sooooooooooong Ill let that out full when I get in front of the footlights again.\"And shortly afterward she thinks of the song a third time: \"comes looooves old deep down chin back not too much make it double.\"\n In these latter two passages Molly thinks about how she will perform the piece: the emotion she can communicate about \"days beyond recall\" with her eyes and her lips, the piano dynamics she must maintain through the phrase \"ere o'er the world,\" the deep vowel sounds she can produce in \"love's old\" by keeping her chin back, the \"weeping tone\" she can get by doubling the single syllable of \"dead\" into \"deaead\" over the course of a quarter note, the difficulty of articulating all the clustered consonants of \"mists began\" (\"istsbeg\"), the extended whole note of the final \"song\" (in the 3/4 time signature of the sheet music, a dotted half note tied to a quarter note with a fermata). Molly is an artist. Elsewhere she thinks of aesthetic choices that two male singers have made in performing another popular song of the 19th century, approving of Simon Dedalus' natural articulation and scorning Bartell Darcy's pompous artificiality. \n § The first edition in 1922 contained what would seem to be one more literary imitation of musical effects: \"days beyond recall\" was printed as \"days beyondre call.\" This typography was corrected in the Odyssey Press editions, but the Gabler edition restores it. Tempting as it is to find one more inventive deployment of language in the passage, my online text assumes that the editors of the 1930s knew what they were doing, because the short \"re\" seems to belong as firmly to its \"call\" as \"be\" does to its \"yond.\" The song gives these two words a very natural musical expression, converting the iambs (be-YOND re-CALL) into a simple dotted rhythm (short-LONG short-LONG). If there is anything in the music corresponding to \"beyondre,\" I cannot hear it."

  "040038lowlintel": {
    "note": " When Bloom steps into the outhouse, \"bowing his head under the low lintel,\" his action is possibly meant to echo a line in a poem published in 1904 by Henry Van Dyke, praising the low lintel of a friend's house as a sign of humility.",
    "expandedNote": " Van Dyke, born in 1852, was a prominent American clergyman and professor of literature. His high-minded poetry, given to stale abstractions and unrelentingly uplifting sentiments, seems an odd candidate for anything but ironic inclusion in Ulysses, but Inscriptions for a Friend's House does contain one suggestive analogue to the sentence in Calypso. The first two of the poem's four sections go as follows:\n THE HOUSE \n The cornerstone in Truth is laid, \n The guardian walls of Honour made, \n The roof of Faith is built above, \n The fire upon the hearth is Love: \n Though rains descend and loud winds call, \n This happy house shall never fall. \n THE DOORSTEAD \n The lintel low enough to keep out pomp and pride: \n The threshold high enough to turn deceit aside: \n The doorband strong enough from robbers to defend: \n This door will open at a touch to welcome every friend. \n When he identifies this poem as a possible literary echo in Calypso, Thornton acknowledges that \"the allusion seems perhaps unlikely.\" He argues for it by observing that Joyce spares Stephen the ignominy of defecating but inflicts it on Bloom, and that the depiction of him bowing his head \"contributes importantly to our impression of Bloom as a man without 'pomp and pride'.\" Calling the privy seat a \"cuckstool\" may amplify the sense of abasement, if the reference is to the cucking-stools used in late medieval and early modern Europe to publicly punish malefactors. But this term had a broader range of meanings."

  "010019money": {
    "note": " The basic unit of money in Dublin in 1904 was the British pound sterling—as it still is today in the U.K. Pounds were divided into shillings (no longer existent), and shillings into pence. Various silver, copper, and gold coins, and paper notes, represented amounts of these basic units.",
    "expandedNote": " The relations of the three units were not decimal, but based on the troy system of measuring precious metals: twelve pence made a shilling, and twenty shillings made a pound, so every pound was worth 240 pence. Abbreviated symbols too were nonintuitive: pounds were written as £ (from Latin libra, pounds), shillings as s. (from Latin solidus, a medieval coin), and pence as d. (from Latin denarius, another coin). The £ was normally placed before the number and the other symbols after, so that a sum of four pounds, three shillings, and ten pence would be entered in a register as £4 3s. 10d. In Lestrygonians Bloom thinks of money in general as \"L.s.d.\"\n More condensed notation could eliminate the minor symbols, following £ with a string of numbers, as is done in writing amounts of decimal currency (e.g., U.S. $24.65). Ithaca compiles Bloom’s budget for June 16 in this way, writing his total debits and credits as \"£ 2.19.3.\" Another informal method of notation, commonly used for marking prices in shop windows, listed simply the number of shillings, followed by a slash and either a dash or the number of pence. Ithaca mentions “Kino’s 11/- Trousers” (i.e., 11 shillings a pair), and “three prizes of 10/-, 5/-, and 2/6 respectively” offered by a Dublin newspaper for the best original poems (i.e., 10 shillings, 5 shillings, and 2 ½ shillings). This slash notation could also include pounds. Ithaca notes that Bloom's savings account contains \"18/14/6 (eighteen pounds, fourteen shillings and sixpence, sterling),\" and it indicates details of his life insurance policy in the same way: \"coming into force at 25 years as with profit policy of 430 pounds, 462/10/0and 500 pounds at 60 years or death, 65 years or death and death, respectively, or with profit policy (paidup) of 299/10/0 together with cash payment of 133/10/0, at option.\"\n Once the basic structure is clear, more confusion beckons. Just as U.S. money is based on a structure of dollars and cents but trades in pennies, two-cent pieces (formerly), nickels, dimes, quarters, half-dollars, dollar coins and bills, and multi-dollar coins and bills, many of which have slang names (\"buck,\" \"two bits,\" \"ten-spot\"), pre-1971 British currency was denominated in £.s.d. but circulated in a bewildering variety of physical instantiations, most of which had slang names on the streets. Here are some of the coins and banknotes, with their slang and £.s.d. equivalents:\n \"Five pound note\" or coin (slang “fiver\")\n £5\n \"Guinea\" (rare as actual coins)\n 21s.\n \"Poundnote\" (slang “quid”) or coin (slang \"sovereign\")\n 20s.\n Half-pound note (slang “ten bob”) or coin (\"half sovereign\")\n 10s.\n \"Crown\" (slang “dollar”)\n 5s.\n \"Half-crown\"\n 2s. 6d.\n \"Florin\" (slang “two bob”)\n 2s.\n \"Shilling\" (slang “bob”)\n 12d.\n \"Sixpence\" (slang “tanner”)\n 6d.\n \"Fourpence\" (slang “groat”)\n 4d.\n \"Threepence\" (slang “joey” or \"threepenny bit\")\n 3d.\n \"Twopence\" (slang “half-groat”)\n 2d.\n \"Penny\" (slang “copper”)\n 1d.\n \"Halfpenny\" (pron. “hayp’ny”)\n ½d.\n \"Farthing\"\n ¼d.\n Nearly every one of these names appears in the novel, as the boldface type indicates. Farthings are mentioned often as the smallest conceivable unit of money: \"I'd rather have you without a farthing\"; \"Not as much as a farthing to purchase a night's lodgings\"; \"exactable to the uttermost farthing\"; \"she never left us a farthing.\" Bloom thinks of £5 as a substantial sum: \"Thinks he'll win in Answers, poets' picture puzzle. We hand you crisp five pound note.\" All of the prices and expenditures mentioned in the novel fall between these two extremes.\n About the twenty-one-shilling “guinea,” Gifford observes that it is “not only more money than the twenty-shilling quid (pound), it is also more fashionable, a gentlemanly sum.” Although the actual coins had apparently not been minted since the early years of the nineteenth century and were seldom encountered, prices in high-class establishments were nevertheless typically quoted in guineas rather than pounds. The coined version of the pound, the “sovereign,” had its own appeal, being a nickel-sized round struck from 22 carat gold (for a gold content of 7.3224 grams, or 0.2354 Troy ounces). It derived its name from the image of the king on the obverse, and Joyce sometimes plays on this association, as in Telemachus when Buck Mulligan cries “Four omnipotent sovereigns” and begins singing about “coronation day” with a Cockney accent.\n Much difficulty attends the important business of asking what these various units and coins mean to the people of the novel in terms of purchasing power and wealth. Inflation has steadily and massively eroded the value of the British pound, as it inevitably does to all paper currencies not linked to fixed amounts of gold or silver. (Britain came off the gold standard to finance World War I.) One pound is an almost negligible amount of money today, but it was a substantial sum in 1904. At the turn of the 21st century, a pound was worth perhaps 150 times as much as at the turn of the 20th century.\n In his introduction to Ulysses Annotated, Don Gifford attempts to approximate the relative value of some of the sums mentioned in the novel. Among other things, he observes that Stephen’s monthly salary, identified in Nestor as \"three twelve\" (£3 12s.), is a comfortable if not princely income—or would be comfortable if he were not “wildly prodigal” with his money on June 16, and presumably other days when he has money in his pocket. In Ulysses (1987), Hugh Kenner observes that \"He uses up about a pound, drinking and treating, in a day when stout was twopence a pint and one could live on less than a pound a week\" (16). Stephen's indifference to money, particularly when he is drunk, is evident in Eumaeus when he reaches into his pockets to lend Corley a penny or two. He cannot keep different coins straight in the darkness and comes up with coins worth 30 times as much: \"Those are halfcrowns, man.\" Stephen gives one of them to Corley anyway.\n Bloom’s assets as detailed in Ithaca—savings of £18 14s. 6d., a life insurance policy of £500, and \"certificate of possession of 900 pounds, Canadian 4 percent (inscribed) government stock\"—make him more than usually comfortable by the standards of the 1904 Dublin middle class. By the 150-to-1 formula, his 900 pounds worth of railway stock would be equivalent to £135,000 in 2000."

  "030109luciferdico": {
    "note": " In the space of a few sentences in Proteus, Stephen manages to associate himself both with Christ (\"Come. I thirst\") and with Satan (\"Clouding over. No black clouds anywhere, are there? Thunderstorm. Allbright he falls, proud lightning of the intellect, Lucifer, dico, qui nescit occasum\"). In terms of his personal mythologizing, this makes sense: both figures appeal to Stephen, as they did to Joyce. There is also some connection in the name Lucifer, which can apply to both Christ and Satan.",
    "expandedNote": " In John 19, the Savior hangs on the cross: \"After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst. Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar, and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth. When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost\" (28-30). The scripture which is being fulfilled is Psalm 69:21, \"They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.\" Stephen's thirst is almost certainly for alcoholic beverages, which he has promised to Mulligan but will instead enjoy with the men he meets in the newspaper office. \n Tradition holds that, before he fell from heaven, Satan's name was Lucifer (in Latin, \"light-bearer\"). The name Lucifer has also been applied to the morning star—a bright planet, usually Venus, seen in the east before sunrise. In Isaiah 14, the decline of the morning star images the fall of an enemy (human?) of God: \"How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High. Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit. They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and consider thee, saying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms; That made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities thereof; that opened not the house of his prisoners?\" (12-17). In Luke 10, Jesus refers to Satan falling from heaven not as the morning star but as lightning: \"And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven\" (18). \n But the morning star and the name Lucifer sometimes symbolize Christ. Stephen's Latin sentence means \"Lucifer, I say, who knows no setting.\" Thornton notes that Father John P. Lahey identified the source of the phrase in a hymn sung by the deacon in praise of the paschal candle during the Easter week Holy Saturday service: \"Flammus eius lucifer matutinus inveniat. Ille, inquam, lucifer qui nescit occasum\"(\"May the rising star of morning find it burning still—that morning star that knows no setting\"). Gifford notes that, in the language of the 1962 Layman's Missal, this chant acclaims \"the light of the risen Christ\"—a star that knows no setting.\n Gifford suggests that the light-bearer who died on the cross and the one who fell from heaven may also be linked through the \"Thunderstorm\" coming to Dublin. Luke's image of Satan falling from heaven like lightning informs Stephen's thought about the \"proud lightning of the intellect.\" But Christ's death too was linked, if not with lightning, then at least with cataclysmic natural events: \"And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. . . . And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost. And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom. And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God\" (Mark 15:33-39). This darkness, interpreted as an eclipse of the sun in Luke and linked with an earthquake in Mark, is never attributed to a thunderstorm in the gospels, but it seems possible that Stephen is making such a connection."

  "020010lycidas": {
    "note": " Phrases from John Milton's pastoral elegy Lycidas (1637) sound in many parts of Ulysses. The earlier references (in Nestor, Proteus, and Scylla and Charybdis) connect to Stephen's fear of water, while later ones (in Cyclops and Eumaeus) echo the poem's setting in forests and pastures.",
    "expandedNote": " Negligently \"opening another book\" in his classroom in Nestor, Stephen moves on to whatever lesson may be next. It turns out to be Lycidas. In this long lyric poem, John Milton urges his Cambridge student peers not to bemoan the drowning of their classmate Edward King: \"Weep no more, woful shepherds, weep no more / For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead, / Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor.\" King is not dead because he has been saved \"Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves\": Jesus Christ, who walked on the waters in Matthew 14 to save his fisherman disciples. \n As Talbot goes on reading Stephen veers into his own thoughts, just as he did while putting the boys through their Pyrrhus paces. The subject of his meditation now is Christ: \"Here also over these craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer's heart and lips and on mine. It lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the tribute. . . . A long look from dark eyes.\" Christ's dark eyes return a bit later in the persons of two non-Christian philosophers: \"Averroes and Moses Maimonides, dark men in mien and movement, flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the world, a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not comprehend.\" The three wise men occupy a metaphysical darkness, invisible within the bustling world of craven hearts and eager faces. As with Pyrrhus, then, Stephen continues to look for the Spirit within the seemingly mindless futility of everyday reality.\n The passage from Lycidas also offers another drowning victim to complement the ones mentioned in Telemachus: the men saved by Mulligan, and a man who has been dead for nine days and is expected to surface soon. In Proteus Stephen thinks of the recovery of this dead body: \"There he is. Hook it quick. Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor. We have him. Easy now.\" He thinks of Shakespeare's The Tempest in the same paragraph, recalling the song in which Ariel offers spiritual consolation to Ferdinand for the drowning death of his father. \n In Scylla and Charybdis the \"curving balustrade\" along the steps in the library make Stephen think of \"smoothsliding Mincius.\" Clearly he is continuing to think of Milton's poem:\n O fountain Arethuse, and thou honour'd flood, \n Smooth-sliding Mincius, crown'd with vocal reeds, \n That strain I heard was of a higher mood. \n Three later allusions in the novel transition from the sea in which Lycidas has drowned to the pastoral landscape in which the poet is mourning his loss. The list of tree-ladies in Cyclops includes \"Mrs Helen Vinegadding.\" In JJQ 19 (1982): 168, Fritz Senn observed that this appears to echo a line of Lycidas:\n But O the heavy change now thou art gone, \n Now thou art gone, and never must return! \n Thee, Shepherd, thee the woods and desert caves, \n With wild thyme and the gadding vine o'ergrown, \n And all their echoes mourn. \n The willows and the hazel copses green \n Shall now no more be seen \n Fanning their joyous leaves to thy soft lays. (37-44)\n Twice in Eumaeus, reference is made to the evocative ending of Milton's poem, where the pastoral poet finishes his song and anticipates fresh poetic challenges:\n Thus sang the uncouth swain to th'oaks and rills, \n While the still morn went out with sandals grey; \n He touch'd the tender stops of various quills, \n With eager thought warbling his Doric lay; \n And now the sun had stretch'd out all the hills, \n And now was dropp'd into the western bay; \n At last he rose, and twitch'd his mantle blue: \n To-morrow to fresh woods, and pastures new.\n Strangely, Bloom connects the pastoral closing line to the oceanic element, placing the shepherd's sentiment in the thoughts of a sailor thinking of heading back out to sea. Talking to W. B. Murphy reminds him of \"more than one occasion, a dozen at the lowest,\" when he has passed by the North Bull and spotted \"a superannuated old salt, evidently derelict, seated habitually near the not particularly redolent sea on the wall, staring quite obliviously at it and it at him, dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone somewhere sings.\" \n The phrase comes up once more in Eumaeus as Stephen and Bloom pass by Gumley in his sentry box, \"still to all intents and purposes wrapped in the arms of Murphy, as the adage has it, dreaming of fresh fields and pastures new.\""

  "030127madelinethemare": {
    "note": " The lines of seemingly nonsensical verse—\"Won't you come to Sandymount, / Madeline the mare\"—that Stephen imagines as he marches rhythmically along the strand (\"Crush, crack, crick, crick\") do not appear to quote any preexisting literary text, though perhaps one will eventually be discovered. More likely, he is playing with sounds to make a little poetic composition, as he will do later in Proteus when he dwells on the sounds of \"mouth to her mouth's kiss.\" The second line refers punningly to either of two French visual artists, and the punning continues as Stephen thinks about the lines he has just brought into consciousness.",
    "expandedNote": " Thornton notes that \"This seems to be an Irish song or poem, but I have not been able to locate it. D. Daiches calls it 'popular verse,' but does not identify it.\" Both scholars appear to be responding to the fact that Stephen's lines sound like ballad meter (iambic tetrameter alternating with iambic trimeter), which is commonly used in English and Irish popular songs and poems.\n Regardless of whether Stephen is recalling a popular song in the first line or making one up, his imagination is clearly at work in the second line. Madeleine Lemaire, Gifford notes, was a watercolor painter known for portraits, illustrations, and floral compositions in the last decades of the 19th century and the first of the 20th. Sometimes called The Empress of the Roses, she was a fixture of the artistic salons in Paris and was one of Marcel Proust's high-society intimates. If Madeline the mare is Madeleine Lemaire, then Stephen—who perhaps encountered her works or her reputation in Paris—may be wishing that this elegant French artiste would come to Dublin and lend some class to the local literary scene.\n Alternatively, Gifford notes, the mare could be Philippe Joseph Henri Lemaire, known as Henri, a sculptor who fashioned the relief of the Last Judgment on the pediment (tympanum) of l'Église de la Madeleine, or church of the Mary Magdalen, in Paris in the 1830s. If Madeline the mare is Lemaire who did the Madeleine, then Stephen, Gifford observes, may be wishing that this impressive sculptor could have come to Sandymount and improved the façade of Mary, Star of the Sea, the church that he has just passed in Leahy's Terrace on his walk to the strand. \n Of course, it is entirely possible that Stephen is thinking of both Lemaires; nor do the verbal acrobatics stop there. His linguistic imagination is still romping as he contemplates the \"Rhythm\" of the lines, fancying that his \"catalectic tetrameter of iambs\" is \"marching. No, agallop: deline the mare.\" Lemaire is now fully a mare, galloping along the shore of the mare (Latin for sea)."

  "010036mailboat": {
    "note": " Leaning on the \"parapet\" that surrounds the roof of the tower, Stephen looks down on \"the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of Kingstown.\" Later, Haines looks over the bay, \"empty save for the smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline.\" The mailboats were oceangoing ships that carried the mail between Ireland and England twice every day. Later in the novel, we learn that Joseph Patrick Nannetti is taking the mailboat to Wales on June 16, to catch a train to London.",
    "expandedNote": " Receiving the day's mail by express rail cars from Dublin, the mailboats carried it to the port of Holyhead in NW Wales for distribution throughout the sister island. Gifford identifies their daily departures as 8:15 AM and 8:15 PM. When Stephen sees the boat passing the harbormouth, the time must be about 8:20. \n In Cyclops, Bloom learns from Joe Hynes that Nannetti, the newspaper printer and M.P., is \"going off by the mailboat . . . tonight\" to ask questions on the following day about an action pending in Parliament. InNausicaa he thinks, \"Nannetti's gone. Mailboat. Near Holyhead by now.\" Gifford notes that \"the run to Holyhead . . . took about two and a half hours in 1904,\" but it does not seem possible that nearly so much time has elapsed since the boat's departure at 8:15, so Bloom's estimate may be mistaken. (Gifford also notes that, according to the Evening Telegraph, the actual Nannetti was asking his questions in Parliament on June 16, not June 17.)"

  "010021malachi": {
    "note": " Having mocked his roommate's \"absurd name, an ancient Greek,\" the man previously known as \"Buck\" says ingratiatingly, \"My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls.\" The resonances in this name may not be quite as numerous as those of Stephen Dedalus, but they evoke ancient Irish leaders (at least fleetingly), an ancient Hebrew prophet (in a false, mocking way), and Greek epic poetry. Later details in Telemachus fold Roman mythology into the mix.",
    "expandedNote": " Noting that both names are \"dactyls\" confirms the pronunciation of the first one: it must be MAL-uh-kee rather than MAL-uh-KYE, rhyming rhythmically (and also alliteratively) with the last name just as Oliver rhymes with Gogarty. The dactyls also insinuate one more hint that Joyce's novel is somehow retelling the story of the Odyssey, because Homer's long poem was composed in dactylic hexameter: prosodic lines of six DUH-duh-duh feet. It is possible, though to my knowledge no one has explored the idea, that Joyce may be inviting his readers to listen for dactylic rhythms as they read his first chapter, just as he has asked them to hear the Catholic Introibo being chanted, and will ask them to hear countless musical tunes. \n Malachy is a common Anglicized form of Máelachlainn, an Irish name borne by a High King and by one of the companions of St. Patrick. But the relative rareness of the name in Ireland, the highly unusual \"i\" spelling, and Mulligan's own comments point toward a more symbolic meaning. In Hebrew Malachi, the last of the twelve \"minor prophets,\" means “My Messenger.” Indeed, some biblical scholars have argued that it was not a man’s proper name at all, but a symbolic one indicating the prophet’s function as a messenger of God. Mulligan is clearly aware of the biblical significance of his name. In Scylla and Charybdis he borrows a scrap of paper on which to jot down an idea for a play: \"May I? he said. The Lord has spoken to Malachi.\"\n Mulligan's determination to “Hellenise” Ireland arguably does make him a kind of prophet, albeit an anti-Christian one. This assumption is supported by the way Telemachus presents him as the bearer of evangelical \"tidings\": “He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea.” In Hart and Hayman's James Joyce's Ulysses, Bernard Benstock argues that the book makes Mulligan a kind of John the Baptist to Stephen’s Christ, in the very limited sense that he appears first, dramatically preparing the way for Stephen to emerge as a character shortly after. By this logic, Mulligan’s crudely anti-Christian message could perhaps be characterized as a proclamation of Good News that introduces Stephen’s similar but much more complex and nuanced message.\n Later in the chapter Mulligan calls himself \"Mercurial Malachi\" and the narrative refers to his Panama hat as a “Mercury’s hat,” alluding to the famous winged hat of the god Mercury. Since Mercury, the Romanized version of the Greek Hermes, was often represented as the gods' messenger, carrying decrees down from Mount Olympus to human beings on earth, this detail builds upon Mulligan’s Hebrew name of Malachi.\n By adding in references to Mercury, Joyce was apparently paying tribute to one part of Oliver Gogarty's fanciful personal mythology. In It Isn't This Time of Year at All: An Unpremeditated Autobiography, Gogarty wrote, \"It is with the unruly, the formless, the growing and illogical I love to deal. Even my gargoyles are merry and bright; my outer darkness by terror is unthronged. My thoughts are subjected to no rules. Behold the wings upon my helmet and my unfettered feet. I can fly backwards and forwards in time and space.\""

  "140020talebegan": {
    "note": " New Style. Gifford comments that the paragraph running from \"But Malachias' tale began . . .\" to \"Murderer's ground\" is largely \"After the style of Horace Walpole's (1717-97) Gothic novel The Castle of Otranto (1764). In this brief passage, Haines plays the part of Manfred, the bloodstained usurper in Walpole's novel.\"",
    "expandedNote": " Walpole's The Castle of Otranto kicked off the fad of the Gothic novel, a late 18th century breed of horror story in which fantastic things happen to ordinary people. Its prose is intensely purple. There are many echoes of Hamlet and his ghostly father stalking about the castle of Elsinore, which accounts for Joyce's allusions in this paragraph to Shakespeare's play (\"in the other a phial marked Poison,\" and \"For this relief much thanks\") and to Stephen's Hamlet theory (\"Which of us did not feel his flesh creep!,\" and \"the ghost of his own father\"). \n If Haines plays the part of the bloody tyrant Manfred, as Gifford argues, he seems also to play the part of the ghost that stalks the castle of Otranto. As they open doors and enter rooms in the labyrinthine structure, characters in Walpole's novel are terrified to see parts of the specter's massive body, an experience which Joyce parodies: \"The secret panel beside the chimney slid back and in the recess appeared... Haines!\""

  "030150malahide": {
    "note": " \"Malahide\" is a coastal village and resort about 10 miles (16-18 km) north of Dublin. In Proteus it figures as the port from which James Stephens reportedly escaped Ireland in 1867 after the failure of the Fenian rebellion. In other chapters it is mentioned as a town which Dubliners may visit on a holiday excursion, or get stranded in through poor choice of late-night trains. Most notably, it also figures as the site of Malahide Castle, ancestral home of the \"Talbot\" family.",
    "expandedNote": " The Talbots owned this baronial estate from the time of the Norman conquest in the late 12th century until its purchase by the Dublin County Council in 1976. In return for services rendered during the invasions, and, more importantly, for pledges of continuing fealty to the distant English crown, King Henry II granted one of his knights, Sir Richard Talbot, an extensive piece of land adjoining an estuary well suited to shipping. The Talbots soon built both a strong defensive fortification and a useful harbor, and in 1476 King Edward IV gave them the important title \"Lord High Admiral of Malahide and the Seas Adjoining,\" which conferred the power to regulate local shipping and exact customs duties. Father Conmee thinks of this title in Wandering Rocks: \"Lord Talbot de Malahide, immediate hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining.\"\n In the next sentence, Conmee recalls a well-known incident that occurred nearly 50 years before the conferring of the title and that has only an incidental connection to the Talbots: \"Then came the call to arms and she was maid, wife and widow in one day.\" In 1429 Sir Walter Hussey, son of Lord Galtrim, married Lady Maud Plunkett, daughter of Lord Plunkett, and was killed in battle later the same day. Very soon after this, Maud married Sir Richard Talbot of Malahide, Walter's rival for her hand. Sir Walter's ghost is said to haunt the castle, filled with resentment toward his unfaithful bride. Lady Maud too is said to haunt the castle, for different reasons.\n The Talbots' reign of nearly eight centuries was interrupted only once. During the English Civil War, Lord John Talbot and his lady were evicted and exiled to the west of Ireland by Cromwell's parliamentary forces, who installed one of their stalwarts, Miles Corbet, in the castle. With the Restoration of King Charles, Lord and Lady Talbot resumed possession of the castle but lost control of the port. They ordered the castle's defenses to be torn down, so that it would never again attract a usurper. (Most of the strong-looking towers and battlements that now adorn the castle are later, purely ornamental additions.) Miles Corbet was eventually captured in the Netherlands and hung, drawn, and quartered in England. His ghost too haunts the castle, and, like Nearly Headless Nick in the Harry Potter tales, falls into four pieces whenever some unlucky person encounters it.\n Another threat to Talbot rule came at the end of the 17th century, when a large branch of the family sided with King James against the forces of King William. It is said that on the morning of the Battle of the Boyne 14 members of the family had breakfast together at the castle, and at the end of the day all 14 were dead. Even though many Talbots fought on the losing side in this pivotal battle, the Malahide estate remained in the family's hands. Responding to the new political conditions, however, the owners of the castle adopted the Protestant faith of the Church of Ireland, a fact reflected in Oxen of the Sun when Mulligan proposes buying Lambay Island from \"lord Talbot de Malahide, a Tory gentleman of note much in favour with our ascendancy party.\"\n Like Father Conmee, Leopold Bloom is well aware of the castle and some of the legends surrounding it. In Eumaeus he recalls a dubious rumor, uttered \"with facetious proclivities,\" that \"Lord\" John Corley derived his nickname through connection with the Talbot family: \"His grandfather Patrick Michael Corley of New Ross had married the widow of a publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine (also) Talbot. Rumour had it (though not proved) that she descended from the house of the lords Talbot de Malahide in whose mansion, really an unquestionably fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing, her mother or aunt or some relative, a woman, as the tale went, of extreme beauty, had enjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen.\" The very funny joke here, delivered in the final five words, concerns the way in which Corley's grandmother is said to have been \"descended from the house\" of the Malahide Talbots. Her mother or aunt or whatnot did not trace her lineage to the great family (a \"noble house,\" as the saying goes), but was quite literally a member of the household: she washed pots in the mansion's kitchen.\n Malahide Castle today remains \"well worth seeing.\" It features a Gothic-style country house displaying many portraits from the National Gallery, splendid gardens and parklands, and a scale model railway with structures and landforms from the surrounding countryside. The nearby village of Malahide, its harbor and marina, and its beach attract summer vacationers from nearby Dublin. Today it is a far-outer suburb of the city served by the DART line, but in Joyce's era it was an independent seaside town, cultivated as a resort since Georgian times. In Eumaeus Bloom recalls the story of Mulligan rescuing a man from drowning \"at Skerries, or Malahide was it?\" Skerries is another seaside resort popular with Dubliners, several miles farther up the coast."

  "030042mananaan": {
    "note": " In keeping with the Homeric analogue of Proteus, a god changing into animal shapes on the seashore, Stephen looks out on the ocean and thinks, \"They are coming, waves. The whitemaned seahorses, champing, brightwindbridled, the steeds of Mananaan.\" Manannán Mac Lir is an Irish god of the sea who is sometimes depicted Poseidon-like driving a horsedrawn chariot (or riding a single horse named Enbarr) over the waves. Stephen thinks of him again in Scylla and Charybdis in connection with a play by George Russell, \"A.E.\" In Circe Russell and Manannán fuse.",
    "expandedNote": " Manannán is strongly associated with the Isle of Man, which lies northeast of Dublin in the Irish Sea. His Irish name comes from an old version of Man, and in many stories he provides protection and good fishing to the Manx people. It seems possible that Stephen is thinking of this connection as he looks out to the sea and sees the waves rolling in from the east. \n In Scylla and Charybdis, George Russell's otherworldly speech triggers Stephen's memory of his play Deirdre:\"Flow over them with your waves and with your waters, Mananaan, / Mananaan MacLir ...\" Gifford observes that lines like these, chanted by the druid Cathvah in act 3, call down \"a druid curse, the Faed Fia (which Russell took to mean the last flood, the end of the heroic age), on the Red Branch Knights just before those heroes begin to quarrel among themselves and destroy a comradeship-in-arms comparable to that of the Arthurian Round Table\":\n Let thy Faed Fia fall,\n Mananaun MacLir\n Let thy waters rise,\n Mananaun MacLir\n Let the earth fail\n Beneath their feet,\n Let thy waves flow over them,\n Mananaun:\n Lord of ocean!\n In 1902 Russell and William Butler Yeats co-founded the Irish National Theatre, which produced Deirdre in that year with Russell playing the part of Cathvah. Circe evokes this performance when, \"In the cone of the searchlight behind the coalscuttle, ollave, holyeyed, the bearded figure of Mananaun Maclir broods, chin on knees. He rises slowly. A cold seawind blows from his druid mouth. About his head writhe eels and elvers. He is encrusted with weeds and shells\" and speaks \"With a voice of waves.\" The name of the god is spelled as in Russell's play and he first appears as Russell does in Scylla: seated in the shadow of a library lamp, bearded, brooding, an \"ollave, holyeyed.\" When Russell stands up, he is transformed into the god and his oceanic character emerges."

In his street tours of the North Inner City, he observes that the man trap was a building on Purdon Street where prostitutes would steal money from men while their pants were down and then flee through a nearby door. Pursuers rushing through the door encountered three more closed doors, any one of which might be the right channel."

Victorians and Edwardians were preoccupied with what Bloom in Eumaeus calls \"Margate with mixed bathing\": a beach notorious for the close proximity of male and female swimmers, for displays of male nudity, and for female flirtation that reportedly gratified voyeurs both male and female.",
    "expandedNote": " Molly may possibly be referring to one of the pools created by erosion in cliff walls near Margate. But the crowded \"strand\" had its own opportunities for women to gaze on nude men. The Victorians believed, in theory, that men and women should bathe apart from one another to avoid the arousal that might (ahem) arise from seeing members of the opposite sex without much clothing on. English beaches that had been developed for tourism had horse-drawn \"bathing machines\" that enabled people to enter fully clothed on the beach, change into their swimwear while the vehicle was being pushed out into the waves, and then discreetly enter the water down some back steps that were covered with fabric, preventing any viewing of exposed skin and clingy garments. On many such beaches, the men's and women's bathing machines were kept far apart, and swimmers were expected to frolic with members of their own gender while in the water. Violations of this expectation were referred to as \"promiscuous bathing.\" \n Margate possessed a reputation for very promiscuous bathing and for voyeurism, both of them aided by the fact that men's and women's bathing machines were not separated by any appreciable distance from each other or from the shore, as the photograph reproduced here illustrates. It also developed a reputation for tolerating male nudity. Mimi Matthews observes on her weblog, mimimatthews.com, that some gentlemen \"emerged from their bathing machines in what the 2 September 1854 edition of the Leeds Times describes as an 'entirely primitive state.' Once in the water, these naked gentlemen had no compunction about approaching the female bathers nearby.\" \n The chats and splashing contests that ensued attracted audiences on the beach, \"some of whom employed telescopes to get a better view of the indecency. During the 1854 incident with the naked gentlemen, the Leeds Times reports that 'The beach was thronged with admiring spectators, and many of them with glasses, although they were not required, as the bathers, from the high tide, were close to the shore.” As in the 1850s, Matthews notes, \"the crowds at Margate during the 1860s often used telescopes to get a better view of the 'nude groups and sportive syrens' in the water. As an additional point of interest, the Era reports that these 'magnifying mediums' were as likely to be used by ladies as by gentlemen.\" \n Ink was spilled on the degradation of public morals threatened by the carryings-on at Margate. Matthews quotes from the 23 July 1865 edition of the Era, a London newspaper: \"There must be something morally infectious in the atmosphere of this popular watering place that induces men and women to do that at Margate which they would blush even to be thought capable of doing in any other locality—namely, disregarding all those social observances which are usually called decency in men, and modesty in women. . . . The bathers of both sexes romp, laugh, and perform all kinds of antics in which the actual nudity of the men is infinitely less offensive to our sense of decency than the modest immodesty of the clinging gossamer vestment in which the females cover, without hiding, their forms.\" This \"chronic evil,\" according to the Era, corrupted not only the bathers but also those watching them from the sand. \n In other parts of the UK, police actions were sometimes taken against men who strayed \"within 200 yards of the ladies bathing ground.\" Such laws against promiscuous bathing were not unrelated to the obscenity laws that kept Joyce's works from being published for many years, and it seems likely that he took an interest in Margate because it represented another form of resistance to the enforcers of public morality."

    "note": " Stephen has spent hours of his young manhood reading arcane medieval texts in \"Marsh's library,\" a library of old books and manuscripts adjacent to St. Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin. \"For whom?\" has he done this, he wonders: \"The hundredheaded rabble of the cathedral close.\" Marsh's Library is located within the high stone walls of the cathedral \"close,\" but the complex of buildings lies within the Liberties. As Gifford puts it, \"St. Patrick's close was at the heart of a teeming slum.\"",
    "expandedNote": " Marsh's library, the first public library in Ireland, was built in the first decade of the 1700s at the instigation of Archbishop Narcissus Marsh, a former Provost of Trinity College, Dublin. Most of its 25,000+ volumes are from the 1500s, 1600s, and 1700s, representing many different fields but with a particular emphasis on theology. It holds several hundred older manuscripts and books. Gifford interprets the \"stagnant bay\" in which Stephen remembers sitting as a reference to the \"wire-cage alcoves where readers could be locked while they read particularly valuable books.\" These three cages were built in the 1770s to reduce thefts. However much spiritual elevation Stephen may have experienced while reading, he has been surrounded by Dublin's huge and hopeless underclass, and \"Beauty is not there.\"\n He was reading the prophetic writings of Joachim of Fiore, which hail from the late 1100s, but he seems to have encountered them in a book published much later. Gifford notes that, \"Apparently spurred by W. B. Yeats's short story 'The Tables of the Law,' Joyce visited Marsh's Library on 22 and 23 October 1902 to consult a volume in Italian and Latin that includes a text purportedly by Joachim as well as biographical notes of uncertain reliability.\""

  "010100martellos": {
    "note": " As Mulligan explains to Haines in Telemachus, the \"Martello\" towers that line the Irish coast at intervals north and south of Dublin (12 to the north, 16 to the south) were built in the early years of the 19th century by the British government under the leadership of \"Billy Pitt\" (Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger), to protect against the threat of invasion \"when the French were on the sea.\"",
    "expandedNote": " The Napoleonic Wars between Britain and France, which had been brewing ever since the French Revolution, began in earnest in 1803. Fearing that French forces would invade to assist the cause of Irish revolution, as they had in the 1790s, the British constructed a series of small defensive fortifications along the coasts of England and Ireland, beginning in 1803 and ending with Pitt’s death in 1806. The tower at Sandycove, by some accounts, was the first built in Ireland, to protect the approaches to Dublin (personal communication from Robert Seidman). If true, this primacy may partly explain Mulligan’s saying that “ours is the omphalos” (i.e., the navel or source of all the others). \n The British took as their model for all these fortifications a squat round tower constructed by the Genovese at Punta Mortella (Myrtle Point) in Corsica, which two of their warships had tried to destroy in 1794. Their combined firepower of 104 guns failed to disable the tower. Most defensive fortifications enjoy the advantage of height: they can fire down on attacking ships, while the ships’ guns must use a good portion of their power (and risk explosive rupture of the barrel) simply to overcome gravity. In addition, the design of this tower was brilliant. Its roundness, combined with a gentle slope inward from base to top, deflected much of the power of incoming shot, and whatever force was not deflected was absorbed by exceptionally thick walls. Additionally, its round artillery platform meant that it could direct fire around an unlimited arc. After two and a half hours of close bombardment HMS Fortitude was badly damaged by shot from the tower’s two eighteen-pounders, and the warships were forced to withdraw. \n The tower was eventually captured by British land forces after two days of fierce fighting, but the British were impressed and resolved to copy the highly effective design. After ringing England and Ireland with similar towers (called Martellos, in a garbled recollection of Mortella), they went on to build many more throughout the Empire during the first two thirds of the century—about 140 in all. The towers were finally made obsolete in the 1860s and 1870s by the introduction of more accurate and powerful rifled artillery on warships. \n [2018] Coincidence governs the events of Joyce's universe in countless ways large and small, fictional and historical. In The Ulysses Guide: Tours through Dublin, 2nd ed. (New Island, 2015), Robert Nicholson notes an interesting fact: \"Coincidentally enough, the order for the building of this tower, and others in the area, was dated 16 June 1804\" (15)."

  "050027marthamary": {
    "note": " As Bloom thinks in Lotus Eaters of the Martha whose letter he has just read and the Mary who has lost the pin of her drawers, a favorite scene of 16th and 17th century painters comes to mind: \"Martha, Mary. I saw that picture somewhere I forget now old master or faked for money. He is sitting in their house, talking. Mysterious.\" The \"he\" is Christ, and the biblical story has interesting connections to Bloom's situation. It is uncertain which painting he may have seen. One by Rubens hangs in Dublin's National Gallery on Merrion Square, but nothing in it corresponds to Bloom's thoughts. A canvas by Jan Vermeer seems a more likely candidate.",
    "expandedNote": " In Luke 10:38-42 Jesus rests from his travels at a house where two sisters are living: \"Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house. And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his word. But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me. And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things: But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.\" \n The story is usually read as a parable about the competing claims of action and contemplation embodied in the two women: performing good works as Martha does is commendable, but it is even more important to attend to the wisdom that can be learned from the incarnate son of God. Bloom, however, does not identify with either sister. A wandering Jew, he projects himself into the Jew who is tired of traveling and appreciative of a chance to unburden himself: \"Nice kind of evening feeling. No more wandering about. Just loll there: quiet dusk: let everything rip. Forget. Tell about places you have been, strange customs. The other one, jar on her head, was getting the supper: fruit, olives, lovely cool water out of a well, stonecold . . . She listens with big dark soft eyes. Tell her: more and more: all. Then a sigh: silence. Long long long rest.\"\n This passage reads like a continuation of Bloom's revery about walking around an exotic mideastern city in Calypso. There, he imagined setting out \"at dawn,\" wandering about \"all day\" until the arrival of \"sundown\" and \"Evening,\" and finally contemplating the \"Night sky.\" In the next chapter he imagines himself at the end of a long journey, tired and eager simply to talk about the \"strange customs\" he has seen. In this reflective sequel he indulges some of the contradictory impulses that appear elsewhere in Lotus Eaters as he is assailed by thoughts of Molly's infidelity: to \"Forget,\" and to \"Tell all.\" The latter impulse, more pronounced here, seems essentially confessional, and the \"long rest\" for which he yearns allies him with the relief-seeking Catholics whose visits to their priests he imagines later in the chapter.\n Mary, sitting at the master's feet and listening \"with big dark soft eyes,\" performs the role of the secular confessor who can hear all and absolve. She probably suggests to Bloom a Martha Clifford who could listen to his marital troubles sympathetically and, if not cure them, at least offer a palliative. Having just read the letter in which Martha asks, \"Are you not happy in your home you poor little naughty boy? I do wish I could do something for you,\" the biblical scene gives Bloom a way to imaginatively fulfill that wish, alleviating the anxiety that afflicts him throughout this chapter. Luke's division of roles does not fully cooperate with the fantasy—it would be better if Martha had sat at Jesus' feet—but Bloom does not think about this. What is important is that there is a Martha in the scene, and also a Mary, since Molly's given name is Marion. \n Many, many painters of the \"old master\" era depicted the scene in the sisters' house. They include Giorgio Vasari (1540), Pieter Aertsen (1553), Jacopo Tintoretto (early 1570s), Jacopo and Francesco Bassano (ca. 1577), Gregorio Pagani (late 1500s), the studio of Frans Francken the Younger (late 1500s or early 1600s), Otto van Veen (late 1500s or early 1600s), Georg Friedrich Stettner (early 1600s), Allesandro Allori (1605), Diego Velásquez (ca. 1618), Hendrik van Steenwyck (1620), Jan Brueghel the Younger and Peter Paul Rubens (ca. 1628), Jan Miense Molenaer (ca. 1635), Pieter de Bloot (1637), Matthijs Musson (1640s), Johannes Spilberg (1643), Hendrik Martenszoon Sorgh (1645), Erasmus Quellinus (ca. 1645), Erasmus Quellinus and Adriaen van Utrecht (ca. 1650), Jan Steen (1650s), and Jan Vermeer (1654-55). There are also many sketches by Rembrandt and his school. \n The Rubens canvas was bequeathed to Dublin's National Gallery in 1901, so presumably Bloom might have viewed it there, but nothing on it corresponds to things that Bloom specifically imagines, and the fact that he can only remember having seen the image \"somewhere,\" possibly in a \"faked\" copy or reproduction, makes it just as likely that he saw some other painter's work.\n Many of these paintings pay exquisitely detailed attention to the food being prepared in Martha's kitchen, with still-life depictions of breads, fruits, whole fishes, sides of venison, hams, assorted fowls, eggs, root vegetables, garlics, peppers, and the like, but I have not seen any with the simple spread of Bloom's mental image: \"fruit, olives, lovely cool water out of a well.\" Nor have I seen one featuring a Martha with a \"jar on her head,\" though the Allori canvas shows water being drawn out of a well, poured into a large jug, and brought to Jesus in elegant glassware. Bloom may very well be improvising. But as his mideastern revery in Calypso was inspired by In the Track of the Sun, it seems reasonable to hunt for a specific pictorial source for its sequel in Lotus Eaters.\n It is tempting to suppose that he might have seen a copy of the magnificent canvas by Vermeer, a very early effort by that artist and his sole religious work. Vermeer offers only a hastily sketched basket of bread in lieu of the loaded tables of some rival paintings, but he beautifully captures the drama of the three-person situation, especially the absorbing discussion between Jesus and Mary. The Christs in most versions of this scene are remarkably uninteresting, but Vermeer's is supremely captivating. He looks very much like a man in need of a \"long rest.\" He projects the quality that has stuck with Bloom: \"Mysterious.\" And he perfectly pits the picture that Bloom later conjures up in Aeolus: \"Our Saviour: beardframed oval face: talking in the dusk. Mary, Martha.\" (He repeats here the time of day he had imagined in Lotus Eaters: \"dusk.\") A philanthrophic capitalist donated this canvas to the National Gallery of Edinburgh in the late 1920s—it was privately held before that—but perhaps Joyce could have seen a reproduction somewhere.\n Martha and Mary appear again in the story of Jesus' resurrection of Lazarus recounted in John 11:1-44. They are Lazarus' sisters, and John mentions that the three siblings live in a town called Bethany. Joyce was certainly aware of this second story: his long list of saints in Cyclops includes \"S. Martha of Bethany\" (Martha is venerated as a saint in the Catholic church). In \"Signs on a White Field,\" published in James Joyce: The Centennial Symposium, ed. Morris Beja et al. (U of Illinois P, 1986): 209-19, Hugh Kenner detects structural echoes of Martha, Mary, and their dead brother in \"The Sisters,\" the first story of Dubliners.\n Gifford picks up one additional thread from the sentences inLotus Eaters, noting that \"Medieval and Renaissance tradition confused Mary, Lazarus' sister, with Mary Magdalene, the prostitute whom Jesus cures of evil spirits; hence Bloom's thought, 'the two sluts in the Coombe would listen,' is appropriate.\" \n Martha and Mary also make brief appearances in Aeolus and Nausicaa. In Circe they become names for Bloom's nether extremities: Bello says that \"Martha and Mary will be a little chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing but the frilly flimsiness of lace round your bare knees will remind you...\" If Bloom's testicles divide along active and contemplative lines, no mention is made of it."

  "060034martincunningham": {
    "note": " \"Martin Cunningham, first, poked his silkhatted head into the creaking carriage and, entering deftly, seated himself\":Hades begins by reintroducing a character from Dubliners. Cunningham appears again in Wandering Rocks and Cyclops, and is mentioned in more than half the chapters of the novel. Joyce drew several of his identifying features, including the hat, from a man named Matthew Francis Kane whose funeral served as a model for Paddy Dignam's. Cunningham stands apart from most Dubliners inUlysses as unusually sympathetic, competent, and purposeful. But Joyce also gave him qualities that relegate him to second-class status, inferior to the less conventional Bloom.",
    "expandedNote": "In \"Grace,\" Martin Cunningham is one of three men, along with Jack Power and C. P. M'Coy, who show up at the home of their alcoholic friend Tom Kernan to perform an intervention, promising to \"make a new man of him\" by escorting him to a religious retreat. (M'Coy appears in Lotus Eaters, and Power and Kernan have speaking roles in Hades.) Like Matthew Kane, Cunningham works in Dublin Castle as the chief clerk for the Crown Solicitor. He is older than Mr. Power, who likewise has a law enforcement job in the Castle.\n The short story gives Cunningham numerous qualities that figure in Ulysses, many of them inspired by Matthew Kane. \"People had great sympathy with him for it was known that he had married an unpresentable woman who was an incurable drunkard. He had set up house for her six times; and each time she had pawned the furniture on him. / Everyone had respect for poor Martin Cunningham. He was a thoroughly sensible man, influential and intelligent. His blade of human knowledge, natural astuteness particularised by long association with cases in the police courts, had been tempered by brief immersions in the waters of general philosophy. He was well informed. His friends bowed to his opinions and considered that his face was like Shakespeare's.\" This man takes the lead in impressing Kernan with the value of the retreat at the Gardiner Street church, and Kernan is duly impressed. But Cunningham's pronouncements about the Jesuits and the papacy, confidently uttered and spectacularly ignorant, suggest that his immersions in the waters of general philosophy must have been very brief indeed.\n In Hades Cunningham possesses enough tact and human sympathy (as well as knowledge of Bloom's family situation) to try to forestall the other men's condemnations of suicide, and Bloom thinks, \"Sympathetic human man he is. Intelligent. Like Shakespeare's face. Always a good word to say. They have no mercy on that here or infanticide.\" In language evocative of Sisyphus, he pities Cunningham for \"that awful drunkard of a wife of his.\" But Cunningham participates in the anti-Semitic banter about Reuben J. Dodd, and when Bloom tries to ingratiate himself into this closed society by telling an unflattering story about Dodd, it is Cunningham who \"rudely\" cuts him off and finishes the story himself. \n Wandering Rocks and Cyclops present Cunningham in the highly positive light of organizing a collection of funds to support Paddy Dignam's destitute family. At the end of Cyclops he appears charitable and prudently proactive as he rescues Bloom from the Citizen's maddened attack, and he has tolerant, sympathetic things to say about Judaism in the midst of the barhounds' bigoted sniping. But he also particpates willingly in their gossip about a suspicious outsider: \" — He's a perverted Jew, says Martin, from a place in Hungary and it was he drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system. We know that in the castle.\" It seems possible that \"perverted\" here may mean something like \"converted\" (\"turned\" from Judaism to Christianity), but the usual connotations of the word are overwhelmingly negative.\n On the afternoon of 10 July 1904 Matthew Kane went swimming from a boat off Kingstown Harbor, suffered a heart attack, and drowned. He was 39 years old. Like Dignam, he had five young children. He also had many friends, and his funeral four days later was much better attended than Dignam's. Among the mourners were James Joyce and his father John. In Surface and Symbol, Robert Martin Adams observes that \"Matthew Kane had been widely popular, and was much respected by his associates and superiors in the Castle, as well as in the community at large\" (63). Joyce apparently thought enough of Kane to represent him in Ulysses in three different ways. In addition to Dignam's funeral, and the character of Martin Cunningham, he included Kane under his own name, violating not only the neat pairing of real and fictional people but even chronology. In a list of Bloom's deceased acquaintances Ithaca mentions \"Matthew F. Kane (accidental drowning, Dublin Bay),\" even though the drowning would not take place for another three and half weeks."

    "note": " Both Gerty MacDowell and Molly Bloom think of \"Martin Harvey,\" a handsome English stage actor who toured widely in the early 1900s. Molly has seen Harvey perform on stage but the actor's visage was also widely available in promotional photographs, one of which Gerty owns.",
    "expandedNote": " John Martin-Harvey was born in 1863 and joined Sir Henry Irving's Lyceum Theatre company in 1882. His career took off in 1899 when Irving gave him the lead role of Sydney Carton in The Only Way, a new stage adaptation of Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities. When Irving died in 1905 Martin-Harvey took over the business and added many production credits to his acting résumé. He was knighted in 1921, and played Sydney Carton in a 1927 film production of The Only Way that was a box-office success.\n Martin-Harvey toured extensively in the UK and in North America. Gifford notes that his autobiography describes his visits to Dublin in the early 1900s as \"a series of triumphs.\" On her Irish photography weblog, Dublin librarian Orla Fitzpatrick observes that \"according to The Irish Times of the 26th November 1904, crowds thronged to see him in the Theatre Royal where he performed Hamlet. His photograph was taken in the same month by Chancellor’s of Dublin and doubtless it sold well.\"\n Sitting across from Bloom on the strand, Gerty sees \"the image of the photo she had of Martin Harvey, the matinee idol, only for the moustache which she preferred because she wasn't stagestruck like Winny Rippingham.\" Even accounting for the lateness of the hour and the rosy glow that drapes all of Gerty's romantic affections, this comparison is very flattering. Bloom may not be the most muscular or dashing man on Dublin's streets, but clearly it would be a mistake to assume that he is sexually unattractive. Molly too implies that he possesses some smoldering good looks. She remembers that in his courting days he had a \"splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry to look at them,\" and she thinks that \"he was very handsome at that time trying to look like lord Byron I said I liked though he was too beautiful for a man.\" \n Molly also recalls a time in the recent past when she went with Milly to see \"the Only Way in the Theatre royal.\" Milly was quite taken with Martin-Harvey's performance: \"she clapped when the curtain came down because he looked so handsome then we had Martin Harvey for breakfast dinner and supper I thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man gives up his life for her that way for nothing.\" \n Molly's thoughts about true love are a response to the story of The Only Way (1899), which Gifford summarizes: \"The play de-emphasizes the novel's dark, melodramatic concentration on the human cost of the French Revolution and concentrates instead on the pathos of the dissipated hero Sydney Carton's Platonic love for Lucie Manette (the Marchioness St. Evremonde), a love that prompts him to go to the guillotine in place of her condemned husband.\" The play, Gifford notes, was written by an Irish cleric named Freeman Crofts Wills with the help of another churchman, Frederick Langbridge."

    "note": " William \"Martin Murphy, the Bantry jobber,\" was a businessman from County Cork who became perhaps the most important capitalist in all of Ireland and wielded great influence in the \"national press.\" He was elected to the House of Commons in 1885 and became a member of \"the Bantry band,\" a group of MPs who all came from the vicinity of Bantry Bay. He published the newspaper that the Citizen mocks, \"The Irish Independent, if you please, founded by Parnell to be the workingman's friend.\"",
    "expandedNote": " In the early 1900s Murphy acquired the Irish Daily Independent, which soon challenged The Freeman's Journal for the claim of being Ireland's leading nationalist newspaper. The Citizen, reading a succession of English names and addresses from the births, deaths, and marriages lists in the Independent, implies that it,like the Freeman's Journal, is insufficiently nationalistic and excessively cozy with the Anglo-Irish elite.\n Joyce told his brother Stanislaus that the United Irishman, a more vigorously nationalistic paper than either the Freeman or the Independent, was the only Irish newspaper worth reading. And given the fact that Murphy turned against Parnell in the struggles after the O'Shea divorce trial, it seems possible that the author shared some of the Citizen's dislike for Murphy. But the Citizen's words amount to little more than ethnophobia.\n Murphy is best known to historians for his steadfast opposition to labor unions, which earned him the nickname \"William Murder Murphy\" after his opposition to unionizing Dublin's tram business led to the greatest labor clash in Irish history, the Dublin Lockout of 1913. His newspaper attacks on union leaders James Larkin and James Connolly during this episode had a further murderous spillover in 1916, when the Independent urged the execution of Connolly and other leaders of the Easter uprising. It got what it asked for.\n It would have been anachronistic for Joyce to allude to this series of events in a book set in 1904, and he does not do so. But he was almost certainly aware that Murphy, in addition to being a titan of Irish journalism, was the man who organized the Dublin United Tramways Company, and the Citizen characterizes him as no friend to \"the workingman.\"\n For more on the insufficiently studied topic of Murphy's career in journalism, see \"Entrepreneurship, Power, and Public Opinion in Ireland; the Career of William Martin Murphy,\" by Andy Bielenberg, at http://www.ucc.ie/chronicon/bielfra.htm."

    "expandedNote": " Gifford and Seidman describe \"Mary Ann\" as “An anonymous bawdy Irish song.” They note that the only printed version cleans up the story of Mary Anne—a young woman who is quite charming “Though in build, and talk, and manner, like a man.” One of the bawdy versions, however (located by Mabel Worthington), concludes with a line that perfectly completes Mulligan’s quatrain: \"She pisses like a man.\"\n § In Proteus, Stephen recalls the third line of the quatrain just after urinating into a rising tidepool. Under the surface of the moving water, he sees \"writhing weeds lift languidly and sway reluctant arms, hising up their petticoats.\" In Circe \"a standing woman, bent forward, her feet apart, pisses cowily\" in the street, her action perhaps a dramatic enactment of the musical example of Mary Ann. In this episode Bloom also imagines the reverse: his having lifted \"billowy flounces, on the smoothworn throne,\" in the interests of \"Science. To compare the various joys we each enjoy.

  "010118masspopemarcellus": {
    "note": " The \"mass for pope Marcellus\" composed by Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina (1525-94) is one of the highest achievements of Renaissance sacred music, as spiritually powerful as it is musically exquisite. Stephen thinks of both the paradoxical achievement of the music (\"the voices blended, singing alone loud in affirmation\") and its religious significance (\"and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs\"). These two things—the tension between monophonic chant and polyphony, and questions of orthodoxy and heresy—were intimately linked in the composer's mind, and Stephen seems to be pondering their relevance to his own literary art.",
    "expandedNote": " Stephen imagines that, behind the voices of the singers, theArchangel Michael (“the vigilant angel”) stands menacing all those who would endanger Christian verities. This fancy almost certainly reflects a mid-16th century debate about the acceptable limits of religious music. Gifford and Seidman observe that Michael was often invoked in the Catholic church’s struggle against Protestantism in the 16th century. One aspect of this struggle was a Counter-Reformation effort to purify sacred music. The Council of Trent (1545-63) issued decrees against “music in which anything lascivious or impure was mixed,” and its sterner members argued that only plainsong (monophonic chant) should be allowed, as opposed to the polyphony (vocal music with multiple melodic lines) that had arisen from chant in the later Middle Ages and become highly popular in the Renaissance.\n Palestrina was a brilliant practitioner of polyphonic composing, and his music was utterly dependent on church patronage. When Marcellus II died in 1555, his successor Paul IV immediately dismissed Palestrina from papal employment. But Paul's death in 1559 opened the holy see to Pius IV, who was more sympathetic to polyphony. In 1564, Gifford and Seidman note, Pius asked the composer to write “a polyphonic mass that would be free of all ‘impurities’ and would thus silence the purists. The Missa Papae Marcelli was that mass, and its performance succeeded in establishing polyphonic music (and Palestrina) as the voice of the Church.” Giuseppe Verdi said of the composer, “He is the real king of sacred music, and the Eternal Father of Italian music.” In James Joyce and the Making of Ulysses (1934), Joyce's friend Frank Budgen quotes him as saying \"that in writing this Mass, Palestrina saved music for the church.\"\n Putting all these details together, one can appreciate the \"rare thought\" that Stephen may be thinking here. He does not invoke Michael to affirm Christian faith. Nor is he using him as the sixteenth century counter-Reformation theologians did, as a symbol of the church's triumph over Protestant heresy. Instead, the righteous archangel standing behind the music represents Palestrina’s justification of his polyphonicart, religion having evolved into what Ellmann calls \"a system of metaphors\" for art in Joyce's mind. The way in which Stephen describes the choir’s singing of the Mass suggests that it represents a defense of aesthetic orthodoxy. The voices are “blended” (polyphonically diverse), but they sing “alone” in a kind of “chant” (like the multiple voices which join to make a single haunting voice in Gregorian plainsong). \n Thus the mass is artistically innovative but still traditional, an intricately complex mixture of diverse elements yet still radiantly “pure.” It is quite plausible to imagine that Joyce heard in Palestrina's Mass something very similar to what he was attempting to do in Ulysses: carry venerable literary traditions like Homeric epic and Shakespearean tragedy forward into contemporary existence, and combine a kaleidoscopic multitude of subject matters and styles in a single aesthetically harmonious whole.\n Gifford and Seidman note that Edward Martyn helped to generate enthusiasm for Palestrina and his Renaissance contemporaries in 1890s Dublin, and the mass for pope Marcellus was first performed at St. Teresa’s church in 1898. It is quite possible that Joyce attended this performance: he loved the lute songs of the English Renaissance, and in Penelope Molly thinks of having sung in a concert in \"St Teresas hall Clarendon St.\" The following seven audio clips present the mass in its entirety, usefully accompanied by the score. The third movement is the Credo, which Stephen has in mind when he thinks of the “Symbol of the apostles.\" \n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16cH1RZcPKs\n (Kyrie)\n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tMWwt25wQA\n (Gloria) \n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A02VoJFv-jk&feature=related\n (Credo)\n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWOou88K4q4\n (Sanctus) \n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJY6Gi9zGHM\n (Benedictus)\n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EhQ1eOfgwI&feature=youtu.be (Agnus Dei I)\n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGWNVrXlhew&feature=youtu.be (Agnus Dei II)"

  "030121mastergoff": {
    "note": " Stephen's intention in fantasizing that his uncle Richie works for \"master Goff and master Shapland Tandy\" is obscure, but it seems both disrespectful and distinctly Irish (not an unusual combination). A \"goff\" is an idiot. Napper Tandy was a hero of the United Irishmen rebellion in the 1790s. The second name may also involve an allusion to Tristram Shandy, hero of the brilliantly digressive novel of that name written by the Irishman Laurence Sterne.",
    "expandedNote": " \"Goff\" is an obsolete English word derived from the Middle French goffe (clumsy, awkward, stupid). The OED quotes uses from the 16th through the 19th centuries, with synonyms like \"a foolish clown.\" Where Stephen may have encountered such a word, and why he should apply it to Goulding's employers—it does not sound much like either Collis or Ward—are questions not easily answered.\n Napper Tandy was no foolish clown, but a determined patriot who led troops in the cause of Irish independence. Stephen thinks of him later in Proteus in connection with a song about the revolt of the 1790s, as he remembers meeting another exiled revolutionary, Kevin Egan, in Paris. Perhaps he already has the strains of the tune floating through his mind. \n The introduction of \"Sh\" into the name makes Gifford hear an allusion to Tristram Shandy (1759-67), and the brainy comedy of Sterne's novel is so Joycean in spirit that this inference seems natural, but if an allusion is involved it is hard to know what to make of it. One might observe that Tristram received his name by an unlucky accident: his father thought that names were destiny, and that no name more certainly doomed one to failure than Tristram, but the name he chose for his son, Trismegistus (\"thrice-great,\" after the legendary mystical philosopher Hermes Trismegistus), became garbled into Tristram when the maid miscommunicated it to the priest. One might go on to note that in Finnegans Wake Joyce played happily with Tristan/Tristian/Tristram and its root meaning of \"sad.\" But one would then be forced to admit that this name does not actually appear in Stephen's fantastic coinage . . . \"Shapland\" is an uncommon English surname, possibly derived from Sheep-land or Chaplain, but it offers little for a reader to work with. What's in a name?"
  },
  "030141masterslave": {
    "note": " Stephen's declaration in Proteus, \"You will not be master of others or their slave,\" suggests that he has been reading German philosophical thoughts about self-realization. Theorization of the master-slave dialectic originated with Hegel, but many later thinkers have taken it up. Nietzsche is another possible source for Stephen's thought. Although Hegel and Nietzsche were engaged in very different philosophical projects, their thoughts about masters and slaves bear interesting connections to one another, and to Joyce.",
    "expandedNote": " Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's The Phenomenology of Spirit (1807) introduced the binary opposition Herrschaft und Knechtschaft into the philosophical lexicon, as one aspect of the dialectical struggle between antithetical forces that defines the development of Geist (Spirit, Mind, absolute self-consciousness). The master-slave dialectic plays itself out between human beings and also within individual subjects. It is a struggle that cannot be resolved by the extinction of either master or slave: both lack full self-consciousness, because each sees elements of itself within the other. Hegel envisions a state of sublation (Aufheben) in which the exclusionary oppositions are somehow transcended, and master and slave become equals.\n Nietzsche's thoughts are rather different. In The Genealogy of Morals (1887) he distinguished the \"slave morality\" of the Judeo-Christian tradition from the aristocratic morals of the ancient Greeks and Romans. The slave tradition advocates values such as kindness, humility, and selflessness, and is animated by resentment of the powerful, anticipating a future Judgment that will redress all the wrongs inflicted by worldly rulers. The master ethos values strength, nobility, and inherent self-worth, and makes no apologies for the exercise of power. Nietzsche billed his work as a polemic against the slave morality that he saw dominating contemporary European culture. \n Gilles Deleuze argued that Hegel and Nietzsche are fundamentally opposite thinkers, but their thoughts about masters and slaves show interesting points of connection. While Nietzsche's analysis of western history seems, on its face, to simply segregate the binaries—he affirms the ancient aristocratic ideal and denigrates the modern Christian one—the truth is doubtless more complicated: \"The history of mankind would be far too stupid a thing if it had not had the intellect [Geist] of the powerless injected into it\" (Genealogy of Morals 1.3). This observation suggests that Nietzsche accepts the broad outlines of Hegel's dialectical view of history, in which opposites clash to produce something greater than either one. \n By the same token, it could be argued that Hegel's conception of master and slave anticipates elements of Nietzsche's thought. His conception is essentially parabolic: it was inspired by his observation of actual struggles within the political sphere (chiefly the Haitian Revolution), but he used it to think about a broader range of human aspirations. If Hegel's slave is construed as a figure for mankind and the master is God, then his Aufheben names a condition in which humanity comes to realize that it controls those spiritual forces which have subjugated it. Such a reading would align Hegel with Nietzsche's conviction that mankind has moved beyond its need for a transcendent God. \n Ulysses repeatedly articulates the idea that God should be understood, in Stephen's words, as \"a shout in the street,\" inseparable from human struggles, and Joyce's use of Arnoldian historiography suggests that he saw a dialectical element in these struggles. Arnold's Hebraism and Hellenism closely resemble Nietzsche's slave morality and master morality, but he did not simply advocate for the Greek ethos. He saw it instead as one element in a relationship of antithetical, counterbalancing forces. If, as Mr. Deasy says, \"All human history moves to one great goal, the manifestation of God\" (it is a big \"if\"), then that manifestation must involve dialectical resolution of the Greek-Hebrew duality.\n Certainly Stephen is engaged in some such dialectical struggle within his own psyche. He finds himself enslaved to \"two masters,\" the external authorities of church and state, but his response is more philosophical than political. When he declares to himself that \"You will not be master of others or their slave,\" he announces his ambition to realize personal power by transcending or sublating the binary opposition. In Circe he says, tapping his forehead, \"In here it is I must kill the priest and the king,\" suggesting that ecclesiastical and political masters are empowered by the slave's consent."

  "040065matcham": {
    "note": " As Bloom reads Philip Beaufoy's Matcham's Masterstroke on the toilet, the first sentence of the story and a later sentence (probably the last) surface in his internal monologue: \"Neat certainly. Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke by which he won the laughing witch who now. Begins and ends morally. Hand in hand. Smart.\" In defining the story through these details, Joyce selected one minor part of a story he himself had submitted to Titbits when he was younger, and he added allusions to an Irish saying and a Miltonic trope that evoke the difficulty of Bloom's marital situation.",
    "expandedNote": " In My Brother's Keeper, Stanislaus Joyce recalls that Joyce's story was \"suitably written down to the style of a weekly paper admired by Leopold Bloom,\" and that he submitted it \"as a joke and as an experiment in raising the wind. . . . The plot concerned a man who goes to a masked ball disguised as a prominent Russian diplomat, and, when returning home on foot, narrowly escapes assassination at the hands of a Nihilist outside the Russian Embassy. The would-be assassin is arrested, and the masquer, too, as a suspicious character, because in his confusion he forgets about his disguise. But he is rescued by 'the laughing witch who is soon to be his bride,' who hearing of the attempt, at once guesses what has happened and hastens to the police station to identify him. He had been wakened from a reverie of the 'laughing witch' by the rude shock of the attempt, and the few sentences that described the reverie were not without grace\" (91).\n Apparently nothing of the Big Lebowski plot remains in the story that Bloom reads. Beaufoy's story elaborates on those few graceful (and \"moral\") sentences that described the romantic reverie, and it seems relevant to his own situation. Molly is indeed a witch by virtue of her Homeric role as Calypso, and the chapter calledCalypso has shown her to be a laughing one: \"— O, rocks! she said. Tell us in plain words. / He smiled, glancing askance at her mocking eyes. The same young eyes.\" \n Joyce has also built into Beaufoy's two sentences two suggestive allusions. In the context of marriage, \"Matcham\" may recall the saying, \"As God made them he matched them,\" common in Ireland and often used ironically to comment on a marital mismatch. Sure enough, several hundred pages later in Nausicaa Bloom thinks of the saying with a mixture of ironic detachment and generous appreciation: \"Always see a fellow's weak point in his wife. Still there's destiny in it, falling in love. Have their own secrets between them. Chaps that would go to the dogs if some woman didn't take them in hand. Then little chits of girls, height of a shilling in coppers, with little hubbies. As God made them he matched them. Sometimes children turn out well enough. Twice nought makes one. Or old rich chap of seventy and blushing bride. Marry in May and repent in December.\"\n \"Hand in hand\" alludes to several uses of the phrase in Milton's Paradise Lost. Book 4 twice describes Adam and Eve in this way: \"hand in hand they passed, the loveliest pair / That ever since in love's embraces met.\" The poem's final book concludes with them leaving Eden in the same way:\n Some natural tears they dropped, but wiped them soon;\n The world was all before them, where to choose\n Their place of rest, and Providence their guide.\n They, hand in hand, with wandering steps and slow,\n Through Eden took their solitary way. (12.645-49)\n After all their uncertainty about one another, and all of the bitter mutual recrimination that follows the eating of the forbidden fruit, these married partners forgive one another and approach their God and their lives in a spirit of humility and trust. Their hand-holding at the end of the epic confirms and extends the first hand-holding in Book 4 (\"With that thy gentle hand / Seized mine: I yielded\") that told them they were one flesh, life partners. \"Hand in hand\" is a moral sentence indeed. \n Multiple aspects of the Blooms' marriage, then, flash through these two sentences of Beaufoy's story: the \"laughing witch\" who captivated Bloom, the \"masterstroke\" by which he won her hand in marriage (many Dubliners, including Molly, wonder about how that happened), the \"matching\" of dissimilar people that sometimes fails spectacularly and sometimes relieves the loneliness of human life, the \"hand in hand\" physical closeness without which a marriage is nothing. Joyce's narrative notes that the story \"did not move or touch\" Bloom, but it certainly can prompt reflection in the reader of Ulysses."

  "150013matches": {
    "note": " The friction-ignited matches that people learned to take for granted in the 20th century were an invention of the 19th, with different forms sold under competing brand names. Characters in Ulysses use the \"vesta\" and the \"lucifer.\" Joyce did not fail to exploit the resonances of the latter name, and his avatar Stephen seems to regularly find symbolic potential in the sudden flaming candescence of these portable fires.",
    "expandedNote": " Early 19th century inventors in several European countries experimented with chemical-coated sticks that could be ignited by crushing a glass bulb or pinching the head inside a folded sheet of sandpaper. A variety developed by the Scotsman Sir Isaac Holden was sold under the Lucifer label in the 1830s, evoking the flames of hell. The name persisted in British slang into the 20th century, becoming attached to later varieties that ignited less explosively and dangerously. The shorter matches called Vestas, named for the Roman goddess of the hearth, also appeared in the 1830s. Instead of wood their sticks were made of cotton threads embedded in wax, in the manner of a candlewick. This name has lasted to the present day, but now applied to matches made of wooden sticks.\n A vesta makes an appearance in Wandering Rocks when \"Two pink faces turned in the flare of the tiny torch\" held by the reverend Hugh C. Love as he is being escorted through the chapter house of St. Mary's Abbey: \"The vesta in the clergyman’s uplifted hand consumed itself in a long soft flame and was let fall. At their feet its red speck died: and mouldy air closed round them.\" In Circe Bloom \"picks up and hands a box of matches\" to Stephen, who has lost them while fumbling in his pockets. He replies, \"Lucifer. Thanks.\" Ithaca recounts how Bloom, after dropping off the area railing and entering his kitchen, \"ignited a lucifer match by friction\" in order to light a coal gas flame. He uses another \"ignited lucifer match\" to start a coal fire in the hearth. \n On this second occasion, some aspect of the narrative consciousness that seems close to the scientifically minded Bloom's observes the match lighting the paper, sticks, and coal in the fireplace, \"thereby releasing the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen of the air.\" But just before this, a different kind of awareness has noted Bloom lighting the assembled fuel \"at three projecting points of paper with one ignited lucifer match.\" The suggestion that the Holy Trinity has thereby been consumed by demonic energy clearly accords with Stephen's ways of thinking. The appearance of fire in the hearth, then, becomes one of the many occasions on which a reader is made to feel the thoughts of the two protagonists strangely meshing.\n Stephen's fixation on the small fires also appears in Aeolus, where matches figure twice. J. J. O'Molloy takes out his cigarette case and asks, \"Who has the most matches?\" He offers a cigarette to Professor MacHugh and to the man who provides a match, Lenehan. Later in the chapter, O'Molloy takes out the case again and someone looks on as he lights a new smoke: \"Messenger took out his matchbox thoughtfully and lit his cigar. / I have often thought since on looking back over that strange time that it was that small act, trivial in itself, that striking of that match, that determined the whole aftercourse of both our lives.\" The reader is hard pressed to make sense of this strange irruption into the already disorienting prose of Aeolus. Should one take seriously its suggestion that tiny actions can have huge consequences? One thing seems certain, though: someone in the newspaper office, probably Stephen, has been staring at a lit match and seeing mysteries unfold."

  "050002maudgonne": {
    "note": " \"Maud Gonne,\" the fiery nationalist whom William Butler Yeats loved hopelessly and unendingly, is mentioned by Kevin Egan in Proteus as a \"beautiful woman\" who was involved with the French politician and journalist Lucien \"Millevoye.\" In Lotus Eaters Bloom recalls how she opposed the free rein given to British troops to roam the streets of Dublin at night, seeking sex from prostitutes.",
    "expandedNote": " Gifford notes that \"Early in the Boer War (1899-1902), in an effort to encourage enlistments, the British army suspended the rule that troops in Dublin spend the nights in barracks. The result was a considerable number of troops prowling O'Connell Street and vicinity in search of 'companionship.' Maud Gonne rallied her Daughters of Ireland to campaign against enlistment in the British army; as part of their campaign the women distributed a leaflet (attributed to Maud Gonne) 'on the shame of Irish girls consorting with the soldiers of the enemy of their country'\" (86). This is probably what Bloom is recalling when he thinks of \"Maud Gonne's letter about taking them off O'Connell Street at night.\" He thinks that \"Griffith's paper is on the same tack now.\" Arthur Griffith, the nationalistic editor of the United Irishman, did indeed join Gonne's protest in May and June 1904.\n Pearl records that in June 1904 the Dublin Corporation passed a resolution calling on army authorities to \"abate the nuisance caused by the British soldiers in the streets of the capital.\" He notes that one of the Corporation's members, \"Mr Corrigan, speaking in favour of the resolution, said he was a loyal man, but 'neither in Paris, Port Said, Cairo, nor Bombay, had he witnessed such scenes.' When the British Government rejected the protest, which Maud Gonne endorsed, Arthur Griffith's United Irishman commented bitterly: 'The British Government has officially announced that . . . it intends to take no steps to prevent the continuance of scenes which have earned for Dublin abroad the reputation of being one of the most immoral cities in the world. . . . That is what we expected it to announce. . . . Dublin is nicknamed in the British army \"the soldiers' Paradise\" because in no city in Great Britain or in any part of the British Empire is such latitude permitted to the soldiery as in Dublin'.\"\n \"M. Millevoye,\" the editor of the periodical \"La Patrie\" beginning in 1894, was an ardent supporter of the nationalist, anti-Republican general Georges Boulanger. His involvement with Maud Gonne, following his separation from his wife Adrienne in the 1880s and lasting throughout the 1890s, produced two children. Georges died in infancy, but Iseult, age 6, went to Ireland with her mother when Maud left Lucien in 1900, and eventually became the object of a marriage proposal (like similar proposals to her mother, rejected) from Yeats."

  "020080mauve": {
    "note": " The color \"purple\" and its sibling \"violet\" play a large role in the visual panoply of Ulysses (17 and 19 mentions respectively). The presence of a third near-synonym, \"mauve\" (12 mentions), points to the scientific discovery responsible for making these colors so popular in the second half of the 19th century: the laboratory synthesis of the first aniline dye. This chemically reproducible color revolutionized fashion and other aspects of Victorian design, studding cityscapes full of brown and grey woolen threads with accents of spectacular, luxurious richness. (Today, mauve sometimes refers to duller hues, but it originally denoted a deep, strong, brilliant purple.) Among other interesting associations in the novel, Joyce attaches this color to the face of Bloom's dead son, Rudy.",
    "expandedNote": "For most of human history, as Victoria Finlay lovingly details in Colour: Travels through the Paintbox (Hodder & Stoughton, 2002), the precious pigments and dyes in artists' paintboxes came from substances like crushed beetle shells, rocks mined from deep in the earth, and the urine of cows fed on mangoes. Then, in the Industrial Era, came \"the world-changing find of mauve by the eighteen-year-old chemistry prodigy William Perkin in 1856\" (xi). Working with other students under the German chemist August Wilhelm von Hofmann, Perkin was using a coal tar-derived salt called aniline to try to synthesize quinine, an anti-malarial substance (very important to the Empire in those days) that could only be harvested from the bark of chincona trees in the Andes. \n All the students' efforts failed, but when Perkin used alcohol to clean a black residue from one of his flasks, he observed an intense purple color and astutely tried dying a piece of silk with it. He conducted further experiments, filed a patent for his process, borrowed money from his father to build a factory, went into the dyeing business, and found almost immediate financial success. Throughout the late 1850s and early 60s, fashionable women in western capitals (including Queen Victoria and the Empress Eugénie) were wearing dresses dyed with the new color. Scientists too took note: in the following decades laboratories produced many new synthetic aniline dyes.\n Purple garments had traditionally been reserved for Roman senators and emperors and other people of great power or wealth. The ancient dye, painstakingly harvested from the anal mucus of certain predatory sea snails, came from the Phoenicians, a mercantile people who lived in Tyre, in the south of what is now Lebanon. Their name, Finlay observes, \"derives from the Greek word for purple, phoinis\" (340). The prestige of the Purple People's product endured long after the garments made with it were lost. Perkin initially dubbed his new color Tyrian Purple, but soon he hit on a brand-new, catchier moniker. He termed it \"mauve,\" a French word for the common mallow plant whose flowers have a similar color—or, alternatively, \"mauveine,\" a compound of mauve and aniline. (\"Aniline\" itself has a colorful history. It comes from nila, an ancient name for the Indus Valley plants that produced the deep blue indigo, i.e. \"Indian,\" hue.) The \"mauveine measles\" that swept through European populations after 1856 influenced the coloring even of postage stamps. \n Ulysses contains a couple of details that hearken back to the early days of this frenzy. In Nestor Stephen gazes on Mr. Deasy's apostle spoons \"snug in their spooncase of purple plush, faded,\" and in Ithaca Bloom dreams of becoming rich by finding a rare postage stamp from the year of his birth (\"7 shilling, mauve, imperforate, Hamburg, 1866\"). Other details suggest that the rage for the synthetic dye was still very much alive in 1904. In Hades Bloom admires the flecks of bright color in a wool coat: \"Nice soft tweed Ned Lambert has in that suit. Tinge of purple. I had one like that when we lived in Lombard street west.\" In Circe \"A man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked,\" walks through the hallway of the brothel on his way out. Bloom has recently bought Molly some sexy \"violet garters\" (Calypso, Nausicaa, Ithaca, Penelope) after receiving payment for his advertising labors, and if one of his new plans pays off he intends to buy her some even sexier \"violet silk petticoats\" (Sirens). In Ithaca he takes off his right sock \"having unhooked a purple elastic sock suspender.\" In Nausicaa Gerty MacDowell remembers some beautiful thoughts that she has written \"in violet ink\" that she bought in Wisdom Hely's stationery store. \n Other purple shades were available before Perkin's discovery. The ancient Celtic hero featured in one of Cyclops' parodic episodes wears leather boots \"dyed in lichen purple,\" an old British and Irish practice that produced a softer shade of purple. (It involved soaking lichens in urine.) The Citizen looks back to other imagined glories when Irishmen traded with Mediterranean sailors: \"Where are the Greek merchants that came through the pillars of Hercules, the Gibraltar now grabbed by the foe of mankind, with gold and Tyrian purple to sell in Wexford at the fair of Carmen?\" These cultural memories of the ancient Phoenician color of emperors surface repeatedly in Circe. Bloom sports \"a purple Napoleon hat\" (presumably the familiar bicorne) while flirting with Josie Breen. When the bishops invest him with royal power later in the chapter he appears \"In dalmatic and purple mantle\" (the dalmatic is a garment worn by English kings at their coronations). The Archbishop of Armagh stands before Bloom \"In purple stock and shovel hat,\" ceremonially administering the oath of office. \n Violet and purple, in Joyce's lyrical prose, often conjure up the lush, evocative hues of night skies and dark sea floors, respectively: \"in violet night walking beneath a reign of uncouth stars\" (Proteus); \"Night sky, moon, violet, colour of Molly's new garters\" (Calypso); \"The bay purple by the Lion's head. Green by Drumleck. Yellowgreen towards Sutton. Fields of undersea, the lines faint brown in grass, buried cities\" (Lestrygonians); \"purple seagems and playful insects\" (Cyclops); \"a cluster of violet but one white stars\" (Nausicaa); \"from the Lion's Head cliff into the purple waiting waters\" (Circe); \" A white yashmak, violet in the night, covers her face\" (Circe).\n \"Mauve,\" on the other hand, is associated with artificially colored fabrics. In Aeolus Stephen imagines Dante's triune rhymes as \"approaching girls, in green, in rose, in russet, entwining, per l'aer perso, in mauve, in purple,quella pacifica oriafiamma, in gold of oriflamme, di rimirar fè più ardenti.\" Gerty MacDowell too thinks of the colors of beautiful garments: \"each set slotted with different coloured ribbons, rosepink, pale blue, mauve and peagreen.\" And the shade over the gasjet in Bella Cohen's brothel, the one that occasions so much uproar, is made of \"mauve tissuepaper.\" The color is mentioned repeatedly as Gerald the moth bangs against it, as the gas level fluctuates, and as Stephen smashes it with his ashplant. (In this last instance, it is called a \"mauve purple shade.\")\n But the most indelible impression of this artificial color is created at the end of the chapter, when an apparition of his dead son comes to Bloom as he stands over Stephen's crumpled body in the street. Rudy holds \"a slim ivory cane with a violet bowknot,\" and \"He has a delicate mauve face.\" It is unclear whether \"delicate\" modifies \"face\" or \"mauve.\" Both are possible, since the dye could be applied in a dilute form, as seen in the shawl shown here. Such an odd facial coloring might seem (since this is Circe) to spring purely from spontaneous hallucination, but that is not the case. The word takes readers back to a moment in Hades when Bloom contemplated a child's tiny coffin passing in the street and thought, \"A dwarf's face, mauve and wrinkled like little Rudy's was.\" \n Here too the coloring seems odd, but knowing that Bloom has actually observed it on his sick son makes a difference. A pediatric cardiologist of my acquaintance who has remotely diagnosed the cause of Rudy's early death—hypoplastic left heart syndrome—notes that the mixture of cyanotic and oxygenated blood resulting from this congenital heart defect would produce precisely the effect Bloom recalls: purple skin.\n It is interesting that a shade (or family of shades) associated with rich, exotic beauty should find its most lasting impression in Bloom's most painful memory. Joyce's text does something similar when Stephen imagines, in Proteus, that the bag of one of the women walking down to the beach contains \"A misbirth with a trailing navelcord, hushed in ruddy wool.\" A botched birth becomes transformed, in his language, from an ugly bloodstained mess to a baby softly enveloped in red wool, with all the sense of quiet peace implied by \"hushed\" and all the connotations of cheerful good health carried by the word \"ruddy.\" Rudy was buried in a wool garment that Molly knitted for him, and the novel allows the memory to resurface twice in visions of lost children with rich reddish coloration—a kind of sea change into something rich and strange. \n Thanks to Vincent Van Wyk for getting me thinking about all the mentions of purple in Ulysses and their relation to the discovery of the first synthetic aniline dye."

  "010089maybemessenger": {
    "note": " Stephen imagines the milkwoman as being a humble avatar, \"the lowly form of an immortal.\" His phrase \"poor old woman\" recalls the Shan Van Vocht of Irish mythology. But the thought that she is \"maybe a messenger\" invokes Homeric divinity, likening the old woman to Athena, who twice appears to Telemachus in the form of an old man to tell him what to do.",
    "expandedNote": " In Book 1 of the Odyssey, the goddess Pallas Athena resolves (in Robert Fitzgerald’s transation) to “visit Ithaka / to put more courage in the son,” and to urge him to take certain measures to oppose the suitors and find news of his father. She visits Telemachus disguised as an old “family friend, the Taphian captain, Mentes.” Telemachus sees through the disguise, however; as Mentes leaves the palace, he “marvelled to himself / divining that a god had been his guest.” In Book 2 Athena returns in a new disguise as Mentor, “comrade in arms of the prince Odysseus, an old man now,” whom Odysseus left in charge of the palace. Telemachus has been praying to the “god of yesterday, / guest in our house” to help him, and Mentor suddenly appears. \n Joyce imitates this numinous appearance, and has Stephen think that the milkwoman may be coming “To serve or to upbraid” him. But Stephen departs from the Homeric original in “scorn[ing] to beg her favour.” This skewing of the Homeric analogue will continue in Nestor: Mr. Deasy corresponds to the old warrior Nestor whom Telemachus consults for news of his father, but Stephen does not feel that he has anything to learn from the crusty old man."

  "040079mcoy": {
    "note": " The first of many people from Dubliners to reappear in Ulysses is \"C. P. M'Coy.\" Bloom thinks of him in Calypso, shortly before he thinks of Gretta Conroy, and then runs into him on the street in Lotus Eaters. In the novel Joyce deepens his earlier portrait, offering one of many contrasts between Bloom and run-of-the-mill Dubliners—this one heightened by some striking similarities in the lives of the two men.",
    "expandedNote": " In the story \"Grace,\" Mr. M'Coy is one of three men who undertake to rescue their friend Tom Kernan from his alcoholism. He \"had been at one time a tenor of some reputation. His wife, who had been a soprano, still taught young children to play the piano at low terms. His line of life had not been the shortest distance between two points and for short periods he had been driven to live by his wits. He had been a clerk in the Midland Railway, a canvasser for advertisements for The Irish Times and for The Freeman's Journal, a town traveller for a coal firm on commission, a private inquiry agent, a clerk in the office of the Sub-Sheriff and he had recently become secretary to the City Coroner.\" \n This varied work history allies M'Coy with Bloom, as of course does the particular employment of securing ads for The Freeman's Journal, which the reader of Aeolus learns is Bloom's current job. The history with the Midland Railway is what makes Bloom think of M'Coy in Calypso, as he ponders how to travel cheaply to Mullingar to visit Milly: \"Might work a press pass. Or through M'Coy.\" After talking with M'Coy at some length in Lotus Eaters, and agreeing to do him the favor of adding his name to the list of funeral attendees, he realizes that he has forgotten to ask him for the free ticket: \"Damn it. I might have tried to work M'Coy for a pass to Mullingar.\"\n The conversation in Lotus Eaters indicates that M'Coy is still working for the city coroner, since his excuse for not being able to attend Dignam's funeral is that \"There's a drowning case at Sandycove may turn up and then the coroner and myself would have to go down if the body is found.\" The conversation also develops the portrait of M'Coy's marriage to a singer. He mentions his wife's career (\"Grace\" says that she \"had been a soprano\") in a way that compares unfavorably with the concert tour planned for Molly Bloom: \"My missus has just got an engagement. At least it's not settled yet.\" The quality of the two women's singing no doubt has something to do with their relative success, as Bloom thinks in Sirens, \"My wife and your wife. Squealing cat. Like tearing silk. Tongue when she talks like the clapper of a bellows.\" \n In addition to his excessive, but harmless, desire to talk about his wife's moribund singing career, M'Coy apparently has a nasty habit of using her supposed upcoming engagements as an excuse to borrow acquaintances' suitcases, and then pawning them. Bloom thinks in Lotus Eaters that he is on the \"Valise tack again,\" and shortly later, \"Didn't catch me napping that wheeze. The quick touch. Soft mark. I'd like my job. Valise I have a particular fancy for. Leather. Capped corners, rivetted edges, double action lever lock. Bob Cowley lent him his for the Wicklow regatta concert last year and never heard tidings of it from that good day to this.\" \n This con, which surfaces in Bloom's thoughts three more times during the course of the day, marks M'Coy as a dishonest human being, and clearly he is not one of Bloom's favorite people: \"Curse your noisy pugnose,\" \"that M'Coy fellow,\" \"that gouger M'Coy stopping me to say nothing.\" In one of the novel's most brilliant phrases, Bloom regards him as he would a bothersome object: \"He moved a little to the side of M'Coy's talking head.\"\n M'Coy was based on an actual Dubliner named Charles Chance, whose wife, Ellmann notes, \"sang soprano at concerts in the 'nineties under the name of Madame Marie Tallon\" (375). Vivien Igoe notes that he was a friend of John Joyce, and it seems that the two men's careers followed a similar trajectory: \"Charles Chance and his family later moved to live with his mother, Mrs Ellen Chance . . . In 1911, he is listed as an unemployed clerk.\" \n Joyce preserved M'Coy's given name: in Hades, when Bloom asks Joe Hynes to insert his name in the newspaper list of people attending the funeral, Hynes says, \"Charley.\" (He cannot remember Bloom's given name, however.)"

    "note": " In Lotus Eaters Bloom walks from the cabstand on Great Brunswick Street to the corner of Cumberland Street South where a lumberyard sits: “Meade’s timber yard. Piled balks. Ruins and tenements.” In Joyce's time Meade's business might still have evoked the militant nationalism of James Carey that Bloom ponders in the church slightly later inLotus Eaters. The connection is insinuated again in Hadeswhen Bloom gazes once more on the business and brackets it with some loaded words: \"National school. Meade's yard. The hazard.\"",
    "expandedNote": "According to Thom's, \"Michael Meade & Son,\" 153-59 Great Brunswick Street, were building contractors with \"sawing, planing, and moulding mills\" facilities. The sawmill business owned by \"Alderman Meade\" is also mentioned in the 28 March 1906 annual special issue of Timber and Wood Working Machinery, published in London. Glossing the \"piled balks,\" Slote quotes the definition in the OED: \"A roughly squared beam of timber, sometimes used technically to designate Baltic timber, which is roughly dressed before shipment.\" \n Why mention this business, twice? Senan Molony's The Phoenix Park Murders (Mercier, 2006) observes that it employed James Carey as a bricklayer for eighteen years. Carey lived not far from the lumber yard on Denzille Street Denzille Street (renamed Fenian Street after independence). He was a central figure of the Invincibles, the Fenian militants who assassinated two top government administrators in front of the Viceregal Lodge in Phoenix Park on 6 May 1882. Before leaving Dublin for a new life after the trials for the murders, which he had planned and was centrally involved in before turning State’s evidence against his co-conspirators, Carey transferred most of his property portfolio to Michael Meade, his former employer. This caused a sensation when it became known in Dublin in 1883. Carey left behind a legal row over his alleged \"fraudulent deed\" of transfer and a demand that the houses be sold to raise the money towards his civic debts. Meade eventually kept his new properties. \n The words before and after the mention of Meade's business inHades might be taken as insinuating his involvement in Fenian politics. A “National school\" called St. Andrew's was sited on Great Brunswick Street. Referring to it as Bloom does, however, may suggest that Meade’s was a school of Nationalism. “The hazard” is a cabstand, nothing necessarily hazardous about it. However, the Invincibles were transported to and from the site of the murders by cabs, several of them were cabbies, and Dubliners in the novel think that the operator of the cabman's shelter in Eumaeus is James Fitzharris, a.k.a. \"Skin the Goat,\" the cabbie who drove a decoy cab from Phoenix Park to central Dublin to confuse the authorities. There was certainly a hazard in Fenian nationalism, and not only for government authorities: a participant risked his life if caught or betrayed."

    "note": " In a striking departure from the Christian eschatalogy that Joyce was fed by the Catholic church, he makes Stephen, in Proteus, and Molly and Bloom, in Calypso, introduce the notion of reincarnation—\"a past life,\" \"metempsychosis,\" \"the transmigration of souls,\" \"reincarnation.\" Throughout Ulysses this conception of human immortality maintains a jocoserious presence (it surfaces most often in Molly's garbled \"met him pike hoses\") as one possible ultimate reality, and as a kind of metaphor or analogue for the mysterious interpenetration of individual identities.",
    "expandedNote": " As he walks on Sandymount Strand Stephen imagines having been alive in the 1330s as a different \"I, a changeling.\" Changelings, commonly encountered in Irish folklore (as in W. B. Yeats' poem The Stolen Child), are mysterious beings swapped for human children by the fairies—or, sometimes, the stolen children themselves. The belief probably arose as an explanation for birth defects, diseases, and other afflictions. It is not clear why Stephen thinks of past lives in these terms, or even that he believes he had one. He may only be imagining himself as a fairy child raised in a medieval bed as a fanciful way of indulging a historical revery. But a sense of deep racial identity informs his imagined ability to travel through time: \"Their blood is in me, their lusts my waves.\" \n Less than a page later, Stephen explicitly thinks of reincarnation, whimsically imagining that the dog he sees nosing about the beach is \"Looking for something lost in a past life.\" Still later in Proteus, he broadens the concept of transmigration from temporal to spatial extension. Somewhere out there in the innumerable \"worlds\" that Giordano Bruno supposed to populate the cosmos there is a parallel universe, some unknown planet in which Stephen plays a part: \"Me sits there with his augur's rod of ash, in borrowed sandals, by day beside a livid sea, unbeheld, in violet night walking beneath a reign of uncouth stars.\" Opposing the Christian cosmology of his time, Bruno proposed that the universe had no center and that the innumerable stars visible in the heavens were suns that might have their own life-bearing planets. He also affirmed the transmigration of the soul.\n Bruno was going back to Plato, and beyond him Pythagoras. When Molly asks her husband the meaning of \"met him pike hoses,\" which she has encountered in a novel, he evinces some awareness of this ancient history: \"— Metempsychosis, he said, frowning. It's Greek: from the Greek. That means the transmigration of souls.\" The word is indeed Greek, and the belief was one feature of Orphic religion in ancient Thrace: Orpheus was said to have taught that a life of ascetic purity could liberate the soul from an otherwise endless cycle of reincarnation. The 6th century BCE philosopher Pythagoras apparently brought the doctrine into greater Greek circulation, practicing vegetarianism in the belief that abstaining from harming other sentient beings could affect the soul's reincarnation in one animal form or another. This Pythagorean aspect of the doctrine appears in Lestrygonians when Bloom thinks of vegetarians: \"Only weggebobbles and fruit. Don’t eat a beefsteak. If you do the eyes of that cow will pursue you through all eternity.\" \n Many of Plato's works in the early 4th century BCE suggest that he was strongly influenced by the Pythagorean doctrine. The myth at the end of the Republic recounts how a man named Er came back from the dead to tell how departed human souls are judged and then choose new forms of existence, many of them animal. Er also saw animals taking the forms of other animals, as happens repeatedly in Proteus and Circe. The Phaedrus and the Meno suggest that true knowledge involves anamnesis or recollection of things we have encountered in the realm of Ideas between our different incarnations, and the Phaedo, the Timaeus, and the Laws all contain thoughts about the doctrine. Some later classical writers referred disparagingly to reincarnation, but Virgil made in a central component of his eschatology in book 6 of the Aeneid, and it was explored sympathetically by Plotinus and the Neoplatonists.\n Bloom's definition of metempsychosis as \"the transmigration of souls\" leaves Molly thoroughly unimpressed: \"— O, rocks! she said. Tell us in plain words.\" In response, he silently racks his brain for what he knows: \"That we live after death. Our souls. That a man's soul after he dies. Dignam's soul...\" Impressively, he rouses his inner lecturer to give his wife a brief but coherent account: \"— Some people believe, he said, that we go on living in another body after death, that we lived before. They call it reincarnation. That we all lived before on the earth thousands of years ago or some other planet. They say we have forgotten it. Some say they remember their past lives.\" Interestingly, Bloom too makes the connection to living on \"some other planet.\"\n Realizing that even this may not mean much to Molly, he tries again, with unfortunate results: \"— Metempsychosis, he said, is what the ancient Greeks called it. They used to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree, for instance. What they called nymphs, for example.\" Metempsychosis should not be conflated with metamorphosis as Bloom does, but there is certainly overlap, as reincarnation erases the boundary between animal and human. Ulysses plays both with metamorphosis in this life (as when human beings are changed into countless animal forms in Circe) and with metempsychosis in the afterlife. The two conceptions share the notion that, in Bloom's words, \"we go on living in another body.\" \n In Nausicaa Bloom watches a bat flitting about near Paddy Dignam's old house and thinks, \"Metempsychosis. They believed you could be changed into a tree from grief. Weeping willow. Ba. There he goes. Funny little beggar. Wonder where he lives. Belfry up there. Very likely. Hanging by his heels in the odour of sanctity.\" Paddy returns inCirce as a baying beagle to announce, Hamlet-like, \"Bloom, I am Paddy Dignam's spirit. List, list, O list!\" When one policeman, piously crossing himself, asks, \"How is that possible?\" and the other one says, \"It is not in the penny catechism,\" Dignam answers, \"By metempsychosis. Spooks.\" In these two passages, Joyce uses the recently departed Dignam to suggest that the Catholic church's Last Things (Hell, Paradise, and the Purgatory that Hamlet Sr. reports on) may not be the only realities that human beings can encounter after death.\n The ancient Greeks and Romans almost certainly derived their ideas of reincarnation ultimately from Indian doctrines that reach back to the Upanishads. No doubt Joyce encountered some of these more directly in theosophical writings of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. One section of Cyclops hilariously employs words covered with Sanskrit-like diacritical marks to narrate Dignam's afterlife experiences. Such passages may easily be dismissed as comic hyperbole, but they plant the seeds of speculation. \n Whatever Ulysses may be judged to say or not say about the afterlife, these quasi-eastern thoughts about reincarnation clearly do invite the reader to think about the mutability of human personality and the permeability of its boundaries. In Hades, as Dignam's coffin is diving down into the dark and the men handling the ropes are struggling \"up and out\" of the grave, Bloom thinks, \"If we were all suddenly somebody else.\" To pursue that thought, speculations about the destination of Dignam's soul are unnecessary. Much of Circe can be read as people suddenly becoming somebody else in the here and now, and Scylla and Charybdis explores the mechanisms by which Shakespeare did so again and again in his plays.\n Viewed in this way, metempsychosis is another name for self-knowledge: the ability to imagine the different forms that one's life can take. It is also a name for empathy or compassion: the ability to feel the sufferings of others as if one lived within their bodies. The word is used in this second way in Oxen of the Sun, when Bloom contemplates \"the wonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis possessed by\" the medical students, who cannot imagine the effect that their raucous laughter may be having on the unfortunate woman trying to give birth. Remembering a past life \"in another body\" probably has less ultimate value than being able to loosen the bonds of self imposed by inhabiting a body in this life."

    "note": " Patrice Egan told Stephen something \"About the nature of women he read in Michelet.\" Jules Michelet was a 19th century Republican historian—anti-monarchist, anti-clerical, free-thinking—whose History of the French Revolution and History of France established him as an important writer and endeared him to the French left. It is easy to see why the socialist and atheist Patrice would be reading him. On \"the nature of women,\" however, Michelet was anything but a revolutionary thinker.",
    "expandedNote": " Gifford observes that he was a \"historian 'of the romantic school.' Michelet is noted not for his objectivity but for picturesque, impressionistic, and emotional history. In La Femme (Woman) [Paris, 1860: trans. J. M. Palmer (New York, 1890)]—presumably the book Patrice has been reading—Michelet traces woman's growth and 'education' toward her ideal and eventual role: 'Woman is a religion' and her function is 'to harmonize religion' (p. 78), just as 'her evident vocation is love' (p. 81) and her indispensable gracefulness is 'a reflection of love on a groundwork of purity' (p. 83). Properly 'cultivated by man' in the light of this ideal, woman will become 'superior to him' to the point where he is 'strong; [but] she is divine . . . practical and . . . spiritual . . . a lyre of ampler range' than man—and yet not 'strong' (pp. 200-201).\" Such effusions typify Victorian-era expressions of the Angel in the House doctrine. \n If Joyce has any darker purpose in including this snippet of cafe conversation, it may be to suggest that the apple has not fallen far from the tree: Patrice is still deeply infected with the Irish Catholic notions of gender and sexuality that have made his father puritanical and unmarried."

    "note": " The bargeman seen in Hades as the funeral carriage crosses the Royal Canal has been \"Dropping down lock by lock to Dublin. With turf from the midland bogs.\" Ireland's midlands contain vast expanses of glacier-scoured, rain-soaked terrain where \"peat,\" a precursor of coal, has been building up for millennia, often to depths of 20-40 feet (up to 12 meters), in so-called \"raised bogs\": rounded, water-logged hills that once were marshes. For a very long time inhabitants have sliced peat out of these raised bogs, stacked it to dry, and then burned it for heat. Turf-cutting accelerated rapidly in the 17th century, and in the 19th century large quantities were shipped to Dublin on barges.",
    "expandedNote": " The construction of the Grand and Royal canals from 1779 to 1816 provided an economical way to bring the cut blocks of turf to Dublin fireplaces. A series of locks overcame the difference in elevation between lowlying Dublin and the upper reaches of the Shannon and Barrow rivers, and horses provided the power to move barges along the flat water of the canals. The narrative of Hades captures both elements of this system: \"On the towpath by the lock a slacktethered horse.\" With tethers pulled taut, barges reportedly moved at speeds up to 10 mph (16 kph). This was state-of-the-art transport in its day, but the picture created in Hades is far from glamorous: \"On the slow weedy waterway he had floated on his raft coastward over Ireland drawn by a haulage rope past beds of reeds, over slime, mudchoked bottles, carrion dogs.\"\n Far more abundant than coal in Ireland and thus cheaper, peat also supplies far less heat—about half the BTUs. Turn-of-the-century middle-class Dubliners saw it as poor people's fuel. When Mr. Best announces in Scylla and Charybdis that Haines has gone off to buy Hyde's Love Songs of Connacht, John Eglinton jokes that \"The peatsmoke is going to his head.\" In Wandering Rocks, Father Conmee sees the same turfbarge that the men in the funeral carriage saw, now about a mile farther east on the Royal Canal, and blesses the Almighty's tender care for tenement dwellers and peasants: \"Moored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a turfbarge, a towhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirty straw seated amidships, smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above him. It was idyllic: and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of the Creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor people.\" Joyce's presentation of the good father's benevolent condescensions is never more withering than here.\n The construction of the two long canals whetted appetites for further government-funded development of the peat resource. Another scheme, not yet attempted at the time of the novel, was to dredge the bottoms of the Shannon and the Barrow, which, as Gifford notes, \"flow through extensive bogs and marshes. In the latter half of the nineteenth century there was considerable public discussion of engineering projects designed to deepen the two rivers in order to drain the marshland and to develop the peat bogs.\" In Cyclops the Citizen castigates the British for ignoring \"the beds of the Barrow and Shannon they won't deepen with millions of acres of marsh and bog to make us all die of consumption.\" After independence Ireland undertook some of this hydraulic engineering and embarked on industrial-scale harvesting of peat, but that era is now coming to a close with recognition of the need to combat global climate change.\n People are also coming to recognize that the boglands contain rich ecosystems that should be preserved, but in 1904 their awareness was focused more exclusively on the economic value of the peat and the inconvenience and disease potential of the standing water. The Citizen is not alone in his distaste for \"millions of acres of marsh and bog.\" In Telemachus Buck Mulligan deplores the condition of \"Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust, horsedung and consumptives' spits.\" Meditating on water in Ithaca, Bloom thinks of \"the noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine marshes, pestilential fens.\" Stephen thinks of Deasy's Stuart coins as \"base treasure of a bog.\" (Some astonishing treasures have been dug out of Ireland's bogs, as well as perfectly preserved \"bog bodies\" and prized bogoak. The water is anaerobic and acidic.) \n The canals now have outlived their intended uses. The building of railways in the second half of the 19th century took away most passenger traffic, and automobiles, just coming on at the time represented in the novel, signaled the coming obsolescence of all barge traffic. Freight dropped steadily in the 20th century before being finally discontinued in 1959. Since then, the canals have gained popularity for recreational use, a practice whose early-20th century anticipations too are acknowledged in Hades. Bloom thinks, \"I could make a walking tour to see Milly by the canal. Or cycle down.\" He wonders also about \"Houseboats. Camping out.\""

You remember the Childs fratricide case. We medical men. By striking him dead with a hatchet. I am wrongfully accused. Better one guilty escape than ninety-nine wrongfully condemned.\" Life here imitates art, which imitates life: a play performed in London in the late 1870s presented the real-life story of a French man who was wrongfully accused of a crime, condemned, and executed. And Bloom's protestation closely echoes Stephen's paranoia in Proteus.",
    "expandedNote": " In 1854 Charles Reade adapted The Courier of Lyons from an 1850 French original, and in 1877 he rewrote it as The Lyons Mail for performance by Henry Irving at London's Lyceum Theatre. All three plays tell the story of Joseph Lesurques, who was one of six men arrested in 1796 for the ambush robbery of a mail coach leaving Paris for Lyons, a major heist that resulted in the murder of the driver and the armed guard. Three of the six men, including Lesurques, were guillotined after the trial, despite the testimony of one of the robbers, Étienne Couriol, that Lesurques had been misidentified because he closely resembled one of the actual accomplices, André Dubosq. Couriol's testimony resulted in the arrest, trial, and execution of Dubosq as well as three more accomplices.\n Despite the conviction of Dubosq, Lesurques was never exonerated by the government and his case became a famous example of miscarriage of justice in France, inspiring the 1850 play and a 1937 film. Reade's adaptation made the story famous in English-speaking countries as well: a silent film re-told the story in 1916, and a talkie came out in 1931. In the London stage production, Henry Irving's performance of the parts of both Lesurques and Dubosc (the spelling in the play) was widely acclaimed.\n As Bloom reminds the constables, the French story chimes with the Childs murder case, in which the brother of a murdered Dubliner was acquitted because of doubt about the testimony of a witness who identified him as having been present at the scene. It also makes for one more uncanny link with Stephen Dedalus, who in Proteus recalls having attended a play in order to secure an alibi against being accused of murder—on a date, 17 February 1904, on which an Irish newspaper reported on an English adaptation of a French play about a man wrongfully accused of murder. At this point the entanglements of art and life, Stephen and Bloom, Paris and London and Dublin, become almost too intricate to follow."

This incongruous intrusion of a popular ditty inProteus resembles another in Hades.",
    "expandedNote": " A common form of the nursery rhyme goes as follows:\n One misty moisty morning,\n When cloudy was the weather,\n I chanced to meet an old man,\n Clothed all in leather.\n He began to compliment\n And I began to grin,\n How do you do, and how do you do,\n And how do you do again?\n Does this flirtatious, silly meeting somehow cohere with Stephen's thoughts about the Eucharist? It is conceivable that the catchy triplet that ends the rhyme (\"How do you do . . . how do you do . . . how do you do again?\") has been sounding in his mind as, just before this, he imagines a triplet of sacring bells (\"Dringdring! . . . Dringadring! . . . Dringdring!\") Or perhaps he is not even consciously thinking of the rhyme. If he is, it would suggest that Stephen's spirit is becoming lighter and more whimsical as he moves from tortured thoughts about clerics in the previous paragraph to dismissal of his \"holy\" phase in the next."

  "080020mitycheese": {
    "note": " Bloom's meditation on cheese in Lestrygonians—\"Cheese digests all but itself. Mity cheese\"—combines an unscientific bit of folk wisdom with a valid empirical observation. The second of these thoughts becomes apparent when \"Mighty cheese,\" the text in all versions of Ulyssesbefore Gabler's, is corrected to \"Mity,\" and when one watches films of cheese mites that were being shown in UK theaters in 1903. The resulting pun manages to suggest that cheese does eat even itself, making it the perfectly cannibalistic agent in this chapter of voracious eaters.",
    "expandedNote": " According to Eric Partridge (whose scholarship on the point is repeated by Thornton, Gifford, and Slote), the saying about cheese digesting everything stretches back to the 16th century. Gifford helpfully supplies a rationale: \"The process of making cheese was popularly regarded as a process of digestion because it involved the use of rennet, a substance derived from animal stomachs and used to curdle milk.\" The precise wording of Bloom's phrase probably derives, as Thornton first observed, from an 18th century work, Jonathan Swift's A Complete Collection of genteel and ingenious Conversation, according to the most polite mode and method now used at Court, and in the best Companies of England. In Three Dialogues. Published in 1738 as Polite Conversation, Swift's dialogues satirically offer to inform readers about the proper methods of conducting genteel chatter. In a typically banal exchange of witty pleasantries in the second dialogue, the eight characters discuss ordering some cheese with their drinks, prompting Lady Answerall to report an inconsequential bit of popular wisdom: \"They say, cheese digests everything but itself.\"\n Joyce found in this saying an image of a foodstuff that is itself a universal eater—mighty cheese! And then he topped it, by giving Bloom knowledge of the phenomenon of cheese mites: tiny arachnids that, unless deterred by oil, cloth, or other coverings, will colonize the rinds of cheeses and sometimes burrow deep into their flesh. The French cheese Mimolette, produced around Lille, is one that benefits from the deliberate practice of such infestation, just as other cheeses gain their distinctive qualities from resident bacteria and molds. Its flavor and texture are significantly defined by mites of the Acarus genus, called cirons orartisons in French.\n The presence of little spider-like creatures in cheese was much in the public mind at the time represented in Joyce's novel. A 1903 film of mites moving about a piece of Stilton cheese was banned in Britain for fear that it might harm sales. One of the most important figures in prewar British cinema, the American-born Charles Urban, produced another 1903 film called Cheese Mites that was slightly more invested in narrative presentation. It showed a well-dressed Edwardian gentleman using a magnifying glass to read the newspaper while lunching outdoors. Turning the glass on his cheese, he is astounded to discover a horde of little bugs scuttling across its surface. \n With his keen interest in the cinema of his day, Joyce could hardly have failed to notice one film or the other, if only by references in newspapers. In a personal communication, Vincent Van Wyk notes that Urban's film aired at the Alhambra music hall in London in 1903. Wondering whether the film might have also been shown in Dublin, Van Wyk wrote to the film historian Luke McKernan, whose search of the British Newspaper Archive showed that it was exhibited at Kingston Gardens in Dublin on 16 November 1903 \"and presumably at other times.\" McKernan adds that Joyce undoubtedly watched other films produced by Urban when he lived in Trieste. \n \"Mity cheese,\" which a typist mistakenly altered from Joyce's manuscript, was his way of referring to these cinematic revelations, but he must also have intended the word to refer backward to cheese's supposed ability to \"digest\" other foods. Small organisms help cheeses like Mimolette become what they are by a kind of self-consumption, showing their phagic powers to be truly mighty. The pun, if it is one, shows Bloom to be perfectly capable of the kinds of witty compression of meaning that he admires in Molly's \"Bass barreltone,\" and that Stephen indulges in all the time, e.g. when thinking of Moors and Lemaires and pigeons."

The book's humor is more complicated, and more affirming of human dignity. Ulysses addresses its most serious concerns in what Ithaca calls a \"jocoserious\" manner.",
    "expandedNote": " On topic after topic—Christianity, epic heroism, Theosophy, Irish nationalism, and on and on—the novel mercilessly mocks received verities while reserving some serious interest in their claims.

  "050040mohammed": {
    "note": " When Bloom sees a cat basking on the warm window sill of a house, he recalls that \"Mohammed cut a piece out of his mantle not to wake her.\" Mantle here means a cloak or robe, not the fireplace ledge (sometimes spelled the same way) that could be called up by the image of the \"warm sill.\" The story, one of many thousands of hadith, traditional reports of the words and deeds of the Prophet, holds an obvious appeal for Bloom, who likes cats and has just thought, \"Pity to disturb them.\"",
    "expandedNote": " The best-known anthology of hadith is the Sahih al-Bukhari, compiled by a Persian scholar named Muhammad al-Bukhārī in the 9th century and revered by Sunni Muslims. It has several passages referring to a woman who was put in Hell because she imprisoned a cat until it died of hunger, but none about the Prophet's act of kindness. Other 9th and 10th century collections, however, report that Muhammad's favorite cat, Muezza, was sleeping on his robe one day when the call to prayer came. Instead of waking her, he cut off the sleeve of the robe. Islamic texts contain many other encouragements to be kind to cats.\n Bloom's sympathetic impulse toward this cat counts not only as one more instance of oriental exoticism in Lotus Eaters, but also as one more meditation on lotus-like states of blissful relaxation. Indeed, nearly all of Bloom's thoughts of the Mideast in this chapter (Jesus at dusk, the excluded peri, Mohammed and his cat) and also the Far East (lazy Cinghalese, a reclining Buddha, opium-smoking Chinese) can be read as efforts to project himself out of his current mental struggles to a place where, as Stephen thinks in Proteus, \"Pain is far.\""

As a very young boy (probably age 6), and new to Clongowes Wood College, he was pushed by an older boy into “the square ditch,” a cesspool for a privy used by the boys in the dormitory. The water was “cold and slimy,” another boy “had once seen a big rat jump into the scum,” and Stephen is soon sent to the infirmary with a severe infection that makes him wonder whether he will die. Now, at age 22, he still dreads the water, as he acknowledges in Proteuswhen he thinks of \"my fear\" in contrast to Mulligan's aquatic heroism."

Fragments of shapes, hewn. In white silence: appealing.\" After this somber echo, the commercial language that follows strikes an anticlimactic and even faintly mock-heroic note: \"The best obtainable. Thos. H.

Dennany, \"monumental builder and sculptor, stone and marble works\" at 2-8 Prospect Avenue, the street that angles up to the cemetery between the Finglas and Glasnevin roads. Thomas Hammond Dennany, born to ardently nationalist parents in Drogheda in about 1840, was listed as a \"stonecutter\" on Prospect Avenue as early as 1867. According to a note by John Simpson on James Joyce Online Notes, his brothers Arthur and Joseph also worked as stonecutters on Phibsborough Road, listing themselves as \"monumental workers\" on the 1911 census. According to Thom's, a fourth brother, James, was working as a stonemason on Prospect Avenue in 1910. \n \"Monument\" is a common synonym for \"gravestone\" or \"headstone,\" but the use of the word in self-advertisements also trumpeted the stone-cutters' execution of large ceremonial sculptures. Simpson quotes from three stories in the Freeman's Journal from the 1870s, 80s, and 90s mentioning monumental Celtic crosses that Thomas Dennany carved for notable Catholic heroes. Among them was the piece shown here, sculpted for the grave of John Keegan Casey, the \"Poet of the Fenians\" who wrote the song The Rising of the Moon and published articles in The Nation under the pen-name \"Leo.\" Vivien Igoe notes that the monuments which Dennany contributed to the Glasnevin cemetery included the splendid crypt that houses Daniel O'Connell's sarcophagus.\n When Dennany himself died in June 1910 he was buried in the Glasnevin cemetery in an unmarked grave."

  "010071moodybrooding": {
    "note": " \"— Don't mope over it all day, he said. I'm inconsequent. Give up the moody brooding.\" Mulligan seems graciously self-deprecating here, but he is, in effect, saying that Stephen should grieve more moderately and less irrationally, and the novel manages to insinuate, by multiple allusions, that his motives are quite selfish. Although the word \"brood\" prompts him to quote immediately afterward from a gentle and goodnatured poem by Yeats, the chapter's ongoing allusions to Homer's Odyssey and Shakespeare's Hamlet link him to less savory advice-givers.",
    "expandedNote": " As Thornton notes, Stuart Gilbert observed in James Joyce's Ulysses that the brooding likens Stephen to Telemachus. Gifford adds that it likens him to Hamlet, whose mother urges him to get over his grief and get out of his mourning attire. If so, then Mulligan plays the roles of Antinous, Claudius, and Gertrude, urging the young prince to get over his grief and resentment because it suits their selfish purposes. These three urge good cheer because good cheer affirms their dominant social position and does not irritate their bad conscience. Mulligan occupies exactly the same position."

    "note": " \"Moore street,\" mentioned twice in the novel, is in central Dublin, several blocks north of the Liffey and two blocks west of O'Connell Street. It was, and is, the site of a large open-air market.",
    "expandedNote": " Flora Mitchell observes that it was the city's \"main shopping district\" in the days (long before Joyce's time) when \"this was the fashionable quarter of Dublin,\" but as time went on and the neighborhood decayed, \"gradually it became an open market, radiating out into courts and lanes filled with booths and stalls\" (64). Mitchell conveys the decidedly unfashionable quality of the street in a typical conversation she has overheard. A customer shouts: \"Your stall looks for all the world like a box of gems Mrs Cassidy.\" And Mrs. Cassidy: \"Thanks be to God it does, but 'tis a fright ye'd get at the dead o' night and the whole street heavin' wid rats. Ye could sthroll on the craythurs! But bedad they do a better job than the corporation. They'd eat up the least crumb off of the street.\"\n When Mitchell wrote this in the 1960s the area had encountered \"periodic threatenings of closure, but much trading is done here and the street is a riot of colour and noise.\" The situation has not changed much over the last 50 years. Today the street presents a cascade of fruits and vegetables, flowers, meat and fish. Haggling over prices is common.\n In Lestrygonians Bloom thinks of the \"filleted lemon sole\" at a fancy dinner being \"the same fish perhaps old Micky Hanlon of Moore street ripped the guts out of making money hand over fist finger in fishes' gills can't write his name on a cheque.\" In Ithaca he thinks of a commode which he \"bought of Henry Price, basket, fancy goods, chinaware and ironmongery manufacturer, 21, 22, 23 Moore street.\" These were real businesses, located next to one another on Moore Street.\n Gifford notes that in 1904 \"M. and P. Hanlon, fish and ice merchants,\" resided at 20 Moore Street (182). Of the fancy goods store, he notes that the 1904 Thom's directory \"lists George, not Henry, Price at this business and address. Henry Price is listed (p. 1990) as a dealer in hardware, chandlery, and fancy goods, 27 South Great George's Street\" (603).\n The resemblance of this name to the \"Henry Blackwood Price\" of Nestor is intriguing. Did Joyce change George to Henry deliberately, or by error?"

  "020020morrice": {
    "note": " As Stephen solves the math equation for Sargent in Nestor,he sees a little dance unfolding on the paper: \"Across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice.\" A morris is an English folk dance in which a story is enacted by the costumed dancers—hence the following reference to \"mummery.\" Stephen imagines the interactive algebraic symbols on the paper—\"letters, wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes\"—as figures moving in a morris dance: \"Give hands, traverse, bow to partner.\"",
    "expandedNote": " The conceit is tiny, but exquisitely intricate. \"Morris\" comes from Middle English Moreys, because the dance was inspired by the Moors. The Moors in Spain also brought algebra (an Arab invention) to Europe; \"so: imps of fancy of the Moors\" in two different fields (mathematics and dance), which Stephen combines into a single fanciful image. The \"quaint caps\" that raise the dancing letters to the second and third power are mummers' hats, but they are also Moorish headcoverings, like the \"whorled . . . emir's turban\" that Stephen sees a few minutes later when he looks at the shells on Deasy's table.\n Contemplating this ingenious little passage, one may recall Joyce's reply when someone told him that Finnegans Wake is trivial. \"Yes,\" he said. \"It is also quadrivial.\" One may further note the interest in Arabic, Islamic, and Middle Eastern culture that extends into thoughts about Averroes and Moses Maimonides a moment later, and takes many other forms in the book. This interest of Joyce's can be seen as early as the story Araby in Dubliners. In Finnegans Wake it is a frequent presence.\n In Scylla and Charybdis the elements of the conceit in Nestor accrete again as Mulligan announces that he has \"conceived a play for the mummers.\" Stephen looks at \"The pillared Moorish hall\" of the National Library, and thinks: \"Gone the nine men's morrice with caps of indices.\" \"Nine men's morrice\" picks up Titania's phrase in A Midsummer Night's Dream 2.1.98, and Gifford notes that it is also the name of a checkers-like game, but Stephen seems still to be thinking primarily of those Moors who invented algebra. Their little number-men have \"caps of indices\": other numbers written above them, raising them to the second or third or fourth power. (In mathematical terminology \"index,\" plural indices, is a synonym for \"exponent\" or \"power\": the number that says how many times another number should be multiplied times itself.)\n [2020] Long before the endless loops of signification that make up the Wake, Joyce was packing dense webs of association into passages like this in Ulysses. In Lestrygonians Bloom thinks of all the meanings felicitously packed into Molly's observation that Ben Dollard has a \"base barreltone\" voice, and concludes, \"See? It all works out.\" Frank O'Connor, the short-story writer, was dismayed to find this kind of multivalence pervading even small details of Joyce's home life. When he visited him in his Rue de Grenelle apartment in the late 1920s he admired a small print of the River Lee in Cork City, put his hand on it, and said, \"That's rather nice, what's that?\" Joyce replied, \"That's Cork.\" O'Connor, who hailed from Cork, impatiently replied, \"Yes, yes! I know it's Cork, but what's the frame made of?\" Joyce said once more, \"It's Cork. I had great trouble getting the French frame makers to make it, they said they never made a frame of cork before.\" \"I felt a little bit dizzy after that,\" O'Connor said, \"and it struck me that the man was suffering slightly from associative mania.\""

  "010134mothergrogan": {
    "note": " \"Mother Grogan\" is a figure in the anonymous Irish song Ned Grogan. She enters Ulysses with Mulligan's clowning about urination in Telemachus: \"When I makes tea I makes tea . . . And when I makes water I makes water . . . Begob, ma'am, says Mrs Cahill, God send you don't make them in the one pot.\" The song appears to have charmed Mulligan because of the old woman's commendable frankness about sex.",
    "expandedNote": " Gifford and Seidman reproduce the first verse:\n Ned Grogan, dear joy, was the son of his mother,\n And as like her, it seems, as one pea to another;\n But to find out his dad, he was put to the rout, \n As many folks wiser have been, joy, no doubt.\n To this broth of a boy oft his mother would say, \n \"When the moon shines, my jewel, be making your hay; \n Always ask my advice, when the business is done; \n For two heads, sure, you'll own, are much better than one.\"\n This pragmatism about the copulative act also inspires Mulligan to joke about infidelity. In Oxen of the Sun, Dixon comments on his gravid belly: \"For answer Mr Mulligan, in a gale of laughter at his smalls, smote himself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable droll mimic of Mother Grogan (the most excellent creature of her sex though 'tis pity she's a trollop): There's a belly that never bore a bastard.\""

  "060045slipperslapper": {
    "note": " In Hades Bloom imagines that women tending to a corpse would \"Slop about in slipperslappers for fear he'd wake.\" In Circe Zoe calls Bella Cohen \"Mother Slipperslapper,\" and later in that chapter a \"woman's slipperslappers\" are among the items flung at Bloom as he flees the whorehouse. Clearly the reference is to flimsy slip-on house shoes, but this word appears in no dictionary I have consulted. The name Mother Slipperslapper suggests that Joyce must have taken it from an old English folk song called The Fox, or A Fox Went Out on a Chilly Night. If Bloom is thinking of this song in Hades, he is, very typically, keeping dismal adult facts of life at bay with the childish play of nursery rhymes.",
    "expandedNote": " The story of a fox visiting an old woman's property at night and relieving her of a duck and a goose dates back to a Middle English poem of the 15th century. Song versions are nearly as old (one was written down on the flyleaf of a manuscript in about 1500), and children's picture books have presented the story for a long time. Thornton notes that Old Mother Slipper Slopper figures in a nursery rhyme printed in the Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes, which comments, \"This rollicking song is traditional both in England and America, the fourth verse being a particular favorite and sometimes appearing alone.\" \n The fourth verse is the one in which the old woman bounds out of bed, sticks her head out of the window, and hollers, \"John, John, the grey goose is gone! / And the fox is on the town-o!\" Many variants of her name have been sung: old Mother Slipperslapper or Slipperslopper (the sentence in Hades manages to evoke both), Flipperflopper (a common American variation, heard on the first recording here), Widdlewaddle, Pitterpatter, or Gigglegaggle, or simply \"the old woman\" or \"the old grey woman\" (as in the second recording).\n Some annotators have labored to find solemn significance in this nursery rhyme figure who pops up in Bloom's thoughts as he thinks of women laying out corpses. Gifford and Seidman associate her with the Shan Van Vocht, saying (without elaboration) that she \"is a type of the 'poor old woman' who personifies Ireland.\" Zack Bowen wavers between such symbol-hunting and realistic interpretation: \"In the passage under consideration mother slipperslapper is a surrogate for Ireland as well as all of womankind and the women who prepare the bodies for burial in Ireland,\" but \"the lady in the song seems here to have been merely used as a cliché for an aroused and wary old woman.\" Nothing in Joyce's text encourages a hunt for mythical figures, but on the other hand it is uncharitable, and unperceptive, to call Mother Slipperslapper a mere cliché! No stale familiarity clings to her comically inventive name, which adds linguistic zing to the \"Huggermugger\" that Bloom has just borrowed from Hamlet. \n Joyce does, however, give his readers a context in which to make sense of the allusion. The old woman on Newbridge Avenue peers bleakly out of her window at the funeral carriages, \"Thanking her stars she was passed over\" by the hand of Death. But in the scene called up from the song an old woman is troubled by a less momentous appearance of Death: \"John, John, the grey goose is gone!\" Bloom's charming inclination to see childish play everywhere he looks, even in the midst of grim adult realities, manifests itself here in an inclination that will characterize him throughout Hades: he simply will not pay solemn reverence to death. \n And Joyce adds another light touch. Against the nursery rhyme playing in the background of his reveries, Bloom imagines that an old woman tending to a corpse would \"Slop about in slipperslappers for fear he'd wake.\" No doubt the skeptical Bloom is recalling old wives' superstitions in a purely dismissive spirit. But Joyce found the superstition affirmed in another \"rollicking song\" (this phrase of the Oxford Dictionary shows up in Hades when Bloom hears \"a rollicking rattling song of the halls\"). That song, Finnegans Wake, touts the miraculous power of whiskey to make a corpse wake up, offering intimations of immortality that Joyce was happy to explore at great length in his last novel."

  "040055moustachecup": {
    "note": " Nearly all visual representations of Bloom, beginning with Joyce's own pencil sketch in 1926, portray him with a mustache (one notable exception is Milo O'Shea's splendid performance in Joseph Strick's 1967 film), but one must dig long and hard in Ulysses to find any hair on the protagonist's upper lip. (A hint: the first twelve chapters will disappoint.) The universal impression has primarily been created, it would appear, by the book's references to a \"moustachecup, sham crown Derby,\" that, according to Calypso, Milly Bloom gave her father as a birthday present: \"Only five she was then. No, wait: four,\" an age confirmed in Ithaca. (Doubtless her mother assisted in the selection.)",
    "expandedNote": " Mustache cups were a fixture of Victorian tea drinking. They originated in England in the second half of the 19th century, in response to a decades-long love-affair with mustaches. A ledge inside the cup, separated from the brim by a small opening, kept messy liquids off gentlemen's lip hairs and prevented their heat from melting the wax that some used to keep those hairs impeccably coiffed. Crown Derby (\"Royal Crown Derby\" after 1890, by proclamation of Queen Victoria) was a prestigious brand of fine porcelain made in Derby. Molly and Milly have evidently economized by purchasing a less expensive \"sham\" knockoff. Ithaca makes clear that the gift came with a \"saucer of Crown Derby\" as well. \n The spirit in which Bloom honors his loving daughter's gift is one of the homely glories of Ulysses. Ithaca notes that no one else in the Bloom household may use the mustache cup, but Bloom comically yields his \"symposiarchal right\" to Stephen when he serves his guest cocoa. This sentence goes on to introduce a mystery, however. It says that after giving Stephen his patriarchal cup \"he substituted a cup identical with that of his guest\" for his own use. Was the birthday cup one of a set? Did Molly select one for Milly to present to her father? How do people tell the special one apart from the others?\n It is interesting that the novel almost never places a mustache on Bloom's face, because it does so to other men frequently and with confident, colorful brushstrokes. Mr. Deasy seems to be led about by his whiskers: \"He turned his angry white moustache,\" \"Blowing out his rare moustache.\" Simon Dedalus' handlebars are likewise animated: \"his angry moustache,\" \"blowing out impatiently his bushy moustache,\" \"tugging a long moustache.\"\n On some men, the display is prodigious. Molly's father BrianTweedy had \"big moustaches,\" \"moustached like Turko the terrible.\" Dennis Breen's father had \"large profane moustaches\"; there was a \"Picture of him on the wall with his Smashall Sweeney's moustaches.\" Father Cowley seems to be losing a battle for control of his face: he \"brushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand.\" The anonymous eaters in the Burton restaurant have trouble keeping theirs out of their food; they are seen \"wolfing gobfuls of sloppy food, their eyes bulging, wiping wetted moustaches.\" But some attentive curation can keep the things under control. Gerty MacDowell's Prince Charming will have \"glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping moustache.\" Bartell d'Arcy appears a \"Conceited fellow with his waxedup moustache.\"\n Other men cultivate a more spartan look. M'Coy stands \"picking at his moustache stubble,\" and Bloom notices that Bantam Lyons has \"Shaved off his moustache again, by Jove! Long cold upper lip. To look younger.\" Seymour Bushe had a \"foxy moustache.\" Tom Kernan thinks his \"Grizzled moustache\" makes him look like a soldier. Of the two soldiers that Molly has consorted with, one or the other, Mulvey or Gardner, had a mustache; Molly can't quite remember which. \n Even women's mustaches come in for narrative attention. Like Nora Barnacle, Cissy Caffrey one night \"dressed up in her father's suit and hat and the burned cork moustache and walked down Tritonville road, smoking a cigarette.\" Bella Cohen \"has a sprouting moustache,\" and when she becomes Bello we see \"fat moustache rings round his shaven mouth.\" Molly thinks that swallowing semen isn't so bad, \"only thats what gives the women the moustaches.\" \n In this lush tropical forest of Dublin mustaches, Bloom's barely registers. The only sentence in the entire novel that clearly suggests he has one is Gerty's visual impression of the man sitting across from her on the strand: \"She could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face that he was a foreigner, the image of the photo she had of Martin Harvey, the matinee idol, only for the moustache which she preferred.\" Is Bloom the one with the mustache? In context almost certainly yes, and in fact definitely so (as contemporary photographs of Harvey demonstrate), but the ambiguity in this, the sole clear indication that Bloom sports a mustache, shows just how little Joyce cared to draw attention to the fact. \n In Circe Henry Flower \"has the romantic Saviour's face with flowing locks, thin beard and moustache,\" but clearly the majority of these features are not to be attributed to Bloom himself."

  "040056mrsmarion": {
    "note": " From the moment he reenters his house and sees a letter addressed to \"Mrs Marion Bloom,\" Bloom becomes relegated (and relegates himself) to the position of a servant. Rather than being acknowledged (and acknowledging himself) as the master of his house, he is shunted into a subordinate role. An Homeric logic plays through this degradation, highlighting Molly's role as Calypso and recreating the usurpation that Stephen experiences in Telemachus.",
    "expandedNote": " According to a social convention that held through most of the 20th century, the letter should be addressed to Mrs. Leopold Bloom, reflecting her husband's masculine primacy as owner of the family name. Boylan's deliberate violation of this convention implies that Bloom's ownership of his wife's body means nothing to him, and Bloom certainly registers the insult: \"His quickened heart slowed at once. Bold hand. Mrs Marion.\"\n This new subjection is immediately subsumed in the quotidian servitude of Bloom's domestic routines. His wife shouts \"Poldy!,\" demanding to know what has come in the mail, and there follows what appears to be a long-accustomed dance of female demands and male acquiescence. Bloom asks \"Do you want the blind up?\" and begins raising it without waiting for a reply. \"— That do? he asked, turning.\" She orders him on to his next task: \"— Hurry up with that tea, she said. I'm parched.\" Before attending to the tea he picks up the dirty clothes that she has carelessly tossed onto the floor the night before, but that intimate service does not spare him from further directions: \"As he went down the kitchen stairs she called: / — Poldy! / — What? / — Scald the teapot.\" He does it. When he reappears some minutes later, bearing a full teatray that he has obsessively made sure has \"Everything on it,\" her response is not thanks: \"— What a time you were, she said.\" And so on. \n \"Mrs Marion\" remains in Bloom's thoughts throughout the day, signifying his subordinate relation to Molly in the household and Boylan's supplanting of him in her sexual affections. The first condition corresponds to Calypso's enslavement of Odysseus, enforced in Joyce's Calypso by the picture of the nymph over the bed, Bloom's comparison of Molly to the nymph, Molly braiding her hair, and associations of food smells and female warmth. The second evokes the suitors' intrusion into the royal palace on Ithaca as they seek to replace Odysseus in Penelope's bed. Joyce has already alluded to this usurpation in Stephen's first chapter, and he brings it back with Boylan's letter. \n In The Economy of Ulysses Mark Osteen observes that \"Bloom's feeling of security is fragile, in part because, like Stephen, albeit more willingly, he is a servant in his household (his service of breakfast in bed is apparently habitual). Given the typical domestic roles of the time, this seems unusual, if not exactly sinister. . . . What is most important is not the actual condition but the perceived one: Bloom believes that the nomoi (rules) of his oikos (home) are out of balance. In the etymological sense, the \"economy\" of his household is disrupted, if not by Molly's power, then by the author of the letter addressed to 'Mrs Marion [not Leopold] Bloom,' as if Bloom were dead. Like Stephen, Bloom is threatened by usurpers\" (81). The fact that he willingly participates in this subordination does not in any way lessen his need to overcome it.\n In Circe, the subjection is expressed even more strongly in fantasy, when Boylan comes to the door on Eccles Street and is ushered in by a Bloom who lacks the distinction of ever having been married to Molly: \"Thank you, sir. Yes, sir. Madam Tweedy is in her bath, sir.\""

  "010126mullingar": {
    "note": " \"Mullingar\" is the chief town in \"county Westmeath,\" west of Dublin in the Irish Midlands. Milly Bloom, the daughter of Leopold and Molly, has recently taken a job in a photographer's shop in Mullingar. In Calypso, she writes her father to say that she has met \"a young student\" there named Bannon. In this chapter, and at several later points in the novel, Bloom thinks of making a trip to Mullingar to visit his daughter, no doubt spurred in part by paternal worries about her sexual maturation. Two kinds of Irish transportation corridors figure in his plans: railways and canals.",
    "expandedNote": " Having contemplated Milly's sexual maturation in conjunction with Molly's sexual infidelity, Bloom thinks a little later in Calypso of paying her a visit: \"Better where she is down there: away. Occupy her. Wanted a dog to pass the time. Might take a trip down there. August bank holiday, only two and six return. Six weeks off, however. Might work a press pass. Or through M'Coy.\"\n The 2s. 6p. return-trip fare that Bloom wonders if he could avoid paying is for a train. \"Grace,\" a story in Dubliners, observes that M'Coy once worked as \"a clerk in the Midland Railway.\" The Midland Great Western Railway company operated a line from Dublin to Mullingar, and thence on to Athlone and Galway. In Lotus Eaters, having agreed to do a favor for M'Coy, Bloom parts from him and later thinks, \"Damn it. I might have tried to work M'Coy for a pass to Mullingar.\" In Eumaeus, he is still thinking about \"the fare to Mullingar,\" which has strangely grown to \"five and six, there and back.\" \n In Hades, on the other hand, he sees a bargeman who has floated into Dublin down the Royal Canal, and thinks of other ways of traveling west: \"Athlone, Mullingar, Moyvalley, I could make a walking tour to see Milly by the canal. Or cycle down. . . . Perhaps I will without writing. Come as a surprise, Leixlip, Clonsilla.\" He soon has second thoughts that betray the purpose of his contemplated visit: \"She mightn't like me to come that way without letting her know. Must be careful about women. Catch them once with their pants down. Never forgive you after. Fifteen.\" Gifford notes that the Royal Canal passes through Athlone (78 miles west of Dublin), and then, to the east, through Mullingar (50 miles), Moyvalley (30), and Clonsilla (11). Leixlip is on the Liffey, not the canal. \n § Joyce spent time in Mullingar with his father and some of his siblings in the summer of 1900. As Ellmann observes (77), it was his first experience of Ireland outside of Dublin and Cork. He tried writing about Mullingar in Stephen Hero but omitted these scenes in A Portrait of the Artist. \"Some of the places he noticed, however, such as Phil Shaw's photographic shop, stayed with him, and he put Milly Bloom to work there in Ulysses\" (78)."

  "010043mummer": {
    "note": " In Telemachus and again in Scylla and Charybdis Mulligan calls Stephen \"A lovely mummer! . . . Kinch, the loveliest mummer of them all!\"; \"O, you peerless mummer!\" Mummers were (and, in some places, still are) impromptu comic actors who performed in the streets, in inns and public houses, and in visits to private houses (just as carolers and trick-or-treaters do). Their performances typically revolved around a story of death and resurrection: the young hero is killed, and a quack doctor revives him.",
    "expandedNote": " Mumming derived from secular folk plays in the Middle Ages, related to other carnival rites like morris dances but distinct from church-sponsored theatrical events like mystery plays. Begging was often involved: performers would visit great houses, usually just before or just after Christmas, expecting to receive handouts. Masking too played a part: cognates of “mummer” in various medieval languages (Middle English, Middle Dutch, Early New High German, Old French) carried the principal meaning of wearing a mask or disguise. These comic performances were still going strong in the British Isles in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, though the tradition has weakened since then. \n Mulligan feels an affinity for these impromptu clowners. In Scylla and Charybdis he declares that \"I have conceived a play for the mummers,\" and launches into the very funny title page of a lewd skit. The spirit of mummery informs his comic performances in Telemachus (the transubstantiation of soap, the melting of candles, the water-making of Mother Grogan and Mary Ann, the ballad of the Joking Jesus, the disquisition on Celtic antiquities) and Oxen of the Sun (the fertilizing farm). It is not so clear, however, why he would call Stephen a lovely mummer. For most of the book Stephen is painfully serious. Even the wry telegram that makes Mulligan call him \"peerless\" shows little of Mulligan's genius for comic improvisation. The flashes of humor that periodically break through the dark clouds of Stephen's rumination are typically wry and ironic—hardly the stuff to please a crowd. \n With the onset of drunkenness in Oxen of the Sun, however, Stephen becomes funnier, and he taps the same comic veins that Mulligan enjoys: blasphemous mockery of religion, and crude celebrations of carnality. His wild ramblings in this episode are quite cerebral (his audience is learned), and we hear them filtered through the medium of the episode’s ornate prose narration. But Circe gives us something closer to his words as he performs a little skit for Lynch and the whores. After Bella objects to some lewd jokes, Lynch says, “Let him alone. He’s back from Paris,” and Zoe, “O go on! Give us some parleyvoo.” “Stephen claps hat on head and leaps over to the fireplace, where he stands with shrugged shoulders, finny hands outspread, a painted smile on his face,” and performs a very funny imitation of a Parisian hawker enticing passersby to enter an establishment and see a sex show. \n This lewd performance may not correspond to any dialogue ever heard in a holiday play, but it does display Stephen in a fit of brilliant comic improvisation that might justify Mulligan’s judgment that he is “a lovely mummer!” And, intriguingly, Circe reaches its climax in a series of events that reproduce the central action of many mummers’ plays: the death and resurrection of the hero. Stephen is knocked flat on his back by a British soldier. As action swirls over his prostrate body, the funeral home worker Corny Kelleher, “weepers round his hat, a death wreath in his hand, appears among the bystanders” and offers to carry Stephen on the cart in which he has just ferried two lechers to Nighttown. It appears finally that his assistance will be unnecessary: “Ah, well, he’ll get over it. No bones broken. Well, I’ll shove along. (He laughs) I’ve a rendezvous in the morning. Burying the dead. Safe home!\" Stephen, then, escapes the honor of being ferried to Glasnevin cemetery by Corny, as Paddy Dignam was on the morning of June 16. \n In an unpublished doctoral dissertation (Purdue University, 1989) titled James Joyce: “The loveliest mummer of them all,” Frances Jeanette Fitch pursues a different interpretation, suggesting that Stephen’s mumming is displayed in his Shakespeare talk in Scylla and Charybdis. She also connects the tradition to Stephen’s name, observing that December 26, the most common day for mummery in Ireland, is not called Boxing Day in that country but . . . St. Stephen’s Day. \nJH 2011"

  "040076musichall": {
    "note": " Although the institution of the \"music hall\" is explicitly mentioned only a few times in Ulysses, many of the songs included in the novel were performed in these British entertainment venues, which dominated popular culture in the later 19th century and the first half of the 20th, until competition from jazz, television, and rock and roll pushed them to the margins.",
    "expandedNote": " One particular Dublin music hall appears as part of the Dublin street furniture in Wandering Rocks: \"They passed Dan Lowry's musichall where Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, smiled on them from a poster a dauby smile. / Going down the path of Sycamore street beside the Empire musichall Lenehan showed M'Coy how the whole thing was.\" This passage makes it sound as if Lenehan and M'Coy are passing by two music halls in quick succession, but in fact they were different names for the same establishment. Dan Lowrey's Star of Erin Music Hall was renamed the Empire Theatre of Varieties in 1897. Today the building on Sycamore Street, just off of Dame Street in the vicinity of The Temple Bar, houses the Olympia Theatre, which still books many musical acts. \n Early London music halls evolved from public houses that offered live entertainment. Paying customers could sit at tables eating food, drinking alcohol, and smoking tobacco while the performances went on. By the end of the 19th century the halls became more like traditional theaters, and eating, drinking, and smoking were no longer part of the picture. Music halls featured various kinds of popular music, including folk songs and ballads, light opera, and American minstrel routines, as well as theatrical fare including comic skits, recitations, melodramas, acrobatic displays, ventriloquists, drag acts, mimes, and more. In this respect establisments like the Empire cannot be easily distinguished from mainline theaters like the Gaiety, the Queen's, and the Royal, which mingled purely dramatic productions with similar crowd-pleasing displays.\n But the halls' bread and butter was performance of professional composers' fresh, contemporary songs. Most of these songs had catchy refrains, and audiences would often join in on the choruses. The subject matter appealed to working-class concerns and sensibilities. Many songs from the music hall repertoire are still familiar today, such as It's a Long Way to Tipperary, Daddy Wouldn't Buy Me a Bow Wow, I'm Henery the Eighth I Am, and Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay. Bloom encounters one of these mega-hits, Has Anybody Here Seen Kelly?, being performed on the streets as the carriage rolls along in Hades: \"As they turned into Berkeley street a streetorgan near the Basin sent over and after them a rollicking rattling song of the halls. Has anybody here seen Kelly? Kay ee double ell wy. . . . He's as bad as old Antonio. He left me on my ownio.\" Other popular songs mentioned in Ulysses, such as Love's Old Sweet Song, Those Lovely Seaside Girls, and Woodman, Spare That Tree, would have appeared on music hall programs. \n In Scylla and Charybdis A.E. contrasts the artificiality of music hall songs with the natural expressiveness of folk songs: \"—People do not know how dangerous lovesongs can be, the auric egg of Russell warned occultly. The movements which work revolutions in the world are born out of the dreams and visions in a peasant's heart on the hillside. For them the earth is not an exploitable ground but the living mother. The rarefied air of the academy and the arena produce the sixshilling novel, the musichall song. France produces the finest flower of corruption in Mallarmé but the desirable life is revealed only to the poor of heart, the life of Homer's Phæacians.\"\n In Calypso Bloom thinks of the wages that his daughter is earning in the photographer's shop in Mullingar and contemplates other employment possibilities for a spirited young woman: \"Twelve and six a week. Not much. Still, she might do worse. Music hall stage.\" Gifford comments that this alternative employment would be \"Not very well paid and possibly morally compromising, since music-hallartistes were regarded as living on the permissive fringes of middle-class society.\""

  "080025musteredandbred": {
    "note": " As Bloom sits in Davy Byrne's in Lestrygonians, trying to decide what to eat for lunch, he thinks, \"Sandwich? Ham and his descendants mustered and bred there.\" In these sentences four different puns (ham, mustard, bread, sandwich) are laid atop a slice of biblical history—the story of Noah and his son Ham, also alluded to in Circe. The witticism is not Bloom's, though he may be commended for having read and remembered it. It appears to put him in the mood for a sandwich with gorgonzola and mustard.",
    "expandedNote": "Pun number one is \"Ham.\" Genesis reports that after surviving the flood Noah took up grape-growing, drank some wine, and fell asleep naked in his tent. \"And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without. / And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness\" (9:22-23). Stephen later recalls this episode: \"And Noah was drunk with wine. And his ark was open.\" \n When Noah wakes up from his stupor and learns that Ham has beheld the paternal phallus, he curses Canaan to be \"a servant of servants,\" visiting the sin of the father upon the son. The story may have been intended to justify the subjugation of the Canaanite people to the Israelites. In some later interpretations Ham was arbitrarily held to represent the origin of the dark-skinned people, despised by God, who lived to the south. He is associated with the Egyptians in Psalms 78, 105, and 106, and perhaps in other traditions he became linked to the Arabian peninsula, because a bit of whimsical 19th century writing asserts paradoxically that the deserts there are well stocked with food: \n Why should no man starve on the deserts of Arabia?\n Because of the sand which is there.\n How came the sandwiches there?\n The tribe of Ham was bred there and mustered.\n The puns on ham, bread, and mustard have stuck in Bloom's memory, and it appears that he also recalls the wonderfully delivered pun (worthy of Groucho Marx) on \"sand which is.\" The whole production seems perfectly suited to Bloom's goofy affection for cute double meanings.\n Fritz Senn was the first commentator to discover the source of Bloom's puns. In \"Trivia Ulysseana I,\" JJQ 12.4 (1975): 443-50, he remarks that \"Bloom is not original but remembers some current joke, one version of which is recorded in C. C. Bombaugh, 'A Pun-Gent Chapter' in Oddities and Curiosities of Words and Literature, ed. Martin Gardner (New York: Dover, 1961), p. 158 (this is a republication of the first 310 pages of Gleanings for the Curious from the Harvest-Fields of Literature, 3rd ed., J. B. Lippincott, 1890).\" In defense of the pun on punning, Senn references several details in Lestrygonians: \"Pungent mockturtle oxtail mulligatawny,\" \"pungent meatjuice, slop of greens,\" and \"pungent mustard, the feety savour of green cheese.\""

    "note": " Aggressively caricaturing Stephen's expectation of sympathy in Telemachus, Mulligan charges that \"you sulk with me because I don't whinge like some hired mute from Lalouette's.\" In Victorian and Edwardian Britain, professional mourners called mutes were hired to stand around the home, church, or cemetery, looking somber, sad, and sympathetic, and wearing certain prescribed forms of formal black dress. Lalouette’s was a Dublin mortuary whose rental services included mutes.",
    "expandedNote": " Mutes also served as pallbearers. In Hades, they carry Paddy Dignam's coffin from the carriage at curbside: \"The mutes shouldered the coffin and bore it in through the gates.\" Slightly later, they bear it \"into the chapel.\"\n The word \"mute\" appears fairly often in Ulysses, in various forms. In most cases it simply means \"unspeaking,\" but on at least one occasion it seems as if Joyce may be punning on the functions of funerary mutes. As the carriages approach Prospect Cemetery, the men inside catch glimpses of the many white stone sculptures adorning graves: \"Forms more frequent, white shapes thronged amid the trees, white forms and fragments streaming by mutely, sustaining vain gestures on the air.\" Perhaps other uses of the word contain some remnant echoes of these stylized gesturings: the apparition of Stephen's mother, for instance, \"that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful.\""

  "150002applyeye": {
    "note": " In Nausicaa Bloom thinks of \"Mutoscope pictures in Capel street: for men only. Peeping Tom.\" Mutoscopes were coin-operated boxes that allowed customers to advance a reel of film by turning a handle. Like photographs before them, these early motion pictures were quickly turned to prurient uses, making money by enticing passers-by to watch a moving peep-show. In Circe, a mutoscope motion picture from the early 1900s called What the Butler Saw provides the basis for a fantasy in which Bloom becomes a valet invited to \"apply your eye to the keyhole and play with yourself while I just go through her a few times.\"",
    "expandedNote": " Mutoscopes were coin-operated flip-card viewers activated by a hand crank; when a user turned the handle, 70 mm still photos created a moving picture. The machines were patented in the United States in 1894. They were sometimes called \"What the Butler Saw machines,\" because a short film of that name commented meta-cinematically on the action of staring at half-naked women through a slot. It showed a woman undressing in her bedroom, seen as if the viewer were looking through a keyhole. \n Bloom seems acutely aware of the voyeuristic possibilities that cameras and film-viewing devices were opening up in his time. In Circe, in addition to asking \"May I bring two men chums to witness the deed and take a snapshot?,\" he thinks in photographic or cinematographic terms while he contemplates the deed: \"(His eyes wildly dilated, clasps himself.) Show! Hide! Show! Plough her! More! Shoot!\" The \"shoot\" of Boylan's orgasm becomes indistinguishable from a film shoot, and the showing and hiding of Boylan's penis and Molly's vagina becomes the occasion for thinking about what is hidden and what is shown in peep shows.\n In an essay titled \"Joyce, Early Cinema and the Erotics of Everyday Life,\" published in Roll Away the Reel World: James Joyce and Cinema, ed. John McCourt (Cork University Press, 2010), Katherine Mullin argues that Bloom \"longs for the camera's power to capture the spectacle he craves\" (48)—voyeuristic spectacles of beautiful women laid bare to the eye. This scene in Circe, Mullin concludes, \"savagely fulfills Bloom's cinematic ambitions\" (55).\n What the Butler Saw offered no more than female nakedness, but the title implied something more. The phrase had been current in British popular culture since the 1886 divorce trial of Lord Colin Campbell and his lady, the Irish-born Gertrude Elizabeth Blood, who was accused of having committed adultery with four different men. (For her part, Lady Campbell had won a legal separation from her husband in 1884, on the grounds that he had knowingy infected her with a venereal disease acquired before their marriage in 1881. Both parties filed for divorce after the separation.) In the very well publicized divorce trial, the Campbells' butler testified that he had witnessed his lord's wife copulating with Captain Eyre Massey Shaw of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade, viewing the busy couple through a keyhole. The members of the jury were escorted to the Campbells' London home to verify the plausibility of the butler's testimony. \n It is reasonable to suppose that Bloom, like almost everyone else in London and Dublin, is aware of the notorious divorce trial and the scandalous testimony on which it turned. When he applies his eye to a keyhole in Circe, what he sees is not a woman undressing, but an undressed woman being violated by a man other than her husband."

  "040081boldlarry": {
    "note": " Both Thornton and Gifford suspect an allusion to an Irish song in Bloom's \"my bold Larry\" in Calypso, though they offer different candidates. Thornton cites the ballad Bold Traynor O, which seems to be echoed inSirens. Gifford remarks that \"Larry is a faintly comic name to the Dublin ear\" and cites an example in the ballad The Night Before Larry Was Stretched, which is performed in one of the fantastic parodies in Cyclops.",
    "expandedNote": " Bold Traynor O seems to be performed seldom if at all today, and it may have been obscure in Joyce's day also, but Thornton cites an article by John Hand, \"Street Songs and Ballads and Anonymous Verse\" in Irish Literature: Irish Authors and Their Writings in Ten Volumes (1904), 3:3265-71, observing that it was one of several songs that \"had an immense run in their day\" (3270). (Volume III in Thornton's citation seems to be a mistake for VIII. And Hand does not specify what Traynor's \"day\" may have been.) I have not been able to locate any recordings or even lyrics for this ballad, but its tune is apparently used in a later song called The Flowers of Drogheda. Thornton's claim is strongly supported by the fact that when Boylan rounds the corner of O'Rourke's pub in Sirens Bloom's phrase is varied to sound more like the title of the song: \"By Larry O'Rourke's, by Larry, bold Larry O', Boylan swayed and Boylan turned.\"\n The Night Before Larry Was Stretched is much better known today. Various traditional Irish groups have performed and recorded this 18th century ballad, and Elvis Costello recorded it in 1996 on Common Ground: Voices of Irish Music. Although it is listed in Frank Harte's Songs of Dublin, the melody is English and the lyrics draw heavily on cant terms that were as endemic to London as to Dublin. This execution ballad is performed during the execution scene in Cyclops: \"Considerable amusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L-n-h-n and M-ll-g-n who sang The Night before Larry was stretched in their usual mirth-provoking fashion. Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies.\""

  "010150fatherbird": {
    "note": " Mulligan's poem in Telemachus strives to offend Catholic sensibilities twice in one line: \"My mother's a jew, my father's a bird.\" Christians have long thought of Jesus and his blessed mother as something other than Jews, and when they put doves in Annunciation scenes they do not think of the Holy Spirit literally as a randy bird. The second joke returns in Proteus, with the dove demoted to a mere \"pigeon,\" when Stephen recalls a work called \"La Vie de Jésus by M. Léo Taxil.\"",
    "expandedNote": " In Nestor Mr. Deasy repeats the old canard that by killing Jesus the Jews \"sinned against the light,\" ignoring the fact that Jesus was himself a Jew. In Eumaeus Bloom recalls how he enraged the Citizen by saying \"your God was a jew,\" reflecting that \"mostly they appeared to imagine he came from Carrick-on-Shannon or somewhere about in the county Sligo.\" In the context of such ethnocentrism, Mulligan's \"My mother's a jew,\" while factually unremarkable, is effectively insulting. \n Saying \"my father's a bird\" goes further into the realm of blasphemy, by reading a traditional symbol of the Holy Spirit literally and imagining avian-human intercourse. The gospel of Luke recounts the angel Gabriel's visit to Mary in what became known as The Annunciation. The angel says that the Holy Spirit \"will come upon you\" (!), and that Mary will become pregnant with the Son of God. In later pictorial representations, the Holy Spirit often took the form of a dove. So, in Mulligan's mind, a testosterone-maddened pigeon came upon Mary and inseminated her. \n Mulligan's image fills Stephen's imagination as he walks toward the Pigeonhouse inProteus. He recalls a very brief exchange from a ponderously long (389 pp.) work titled La vie de Jésus, published in 1884. In that work, writing under the pen name Léo Taxil, Gabriel Jogand-Pages tells how Mary's cuckolded husband, Joseph, demands, \"Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position?\" (\"Who has put you in this rotten position?\"). Mary's orthodox account of the paternity is marred by a choice of words very similar to Mulligan's \"bird\": \"C'est le pigeon, Joseph\" (\"It was the pigeon, Joseph\"). This blasphemy enraged the Vatican, and Jogand-Pages was forced to apologize to the papal nuncio and travel to Rome for what Gifford calls \"a well-publicized papal absolution\" (53). \n In Oxen of the Sun, Stephen is still thinking of the passage: \"parceque M. Léo Taxil nous a dit que qui l'avait mise dans cette fichue position c'était le sacré pigeon\" (\"because M. Leo Taxil tells us that it was the blasted pigeon that put her in this rotten position\"). In a personal communication, Ole Bønnerup tells me that when placed before a noun, rather than after it, the adjective sacré changes its meaning from \"sacred\" or \"blessed\" to something like \"bloody\" or \"goddamn,\" so Stephen is adding his own linguistic irreverence to Taxil's. \n The thought that a pigeon sired Jesus sends Stephen's mind on to a young man he knew in Paris named Patrice Egan. It was Patrice who recommended La vie de Jésus to Stephen. But Patrice has more than an incidental connection to the conceit. Since his father Kevin Egan is a \"wild goose,\" he too can truthfully say, \"My father's a bird.\" As in Stephen's conceit about algebra, where morris dances and Moorish turbans combine with the Moorish art of mathematics, the pieces interlock wonderfully."

    "expandedNote": " Joyce's father John Stanislaus Joyce, fictionalized in the novel as Simon Dedalus (\"uncle Si\"), carried a fierce sense of his patriarchal heritage, and he despised May Murray's father and brothers: \"O weeping God, the things I married into.\" Simon Dedalus calls his two brothers-in-law \"Highly respectable gondoliers,\" implying that they are denizens of the lower class. \"De boys up in de hayloft\" likewise seems to imply that the Gouldings are country bumpkins. \n John Joyce's prejudice was inflamed by the Murrays' dislike of him (he already drank too much when he was courting May, and her father John correctly supposed that he would not make her a good husband). It was perversely confirmed by his mother Ellen, who adamantly refused to bless his marriage to May, \"regarding the Murrays as beneath her\" (Ellmann 18). In the novel, Simon's own inveterate alcoholism does not stop him from referring hypocritically to Richie Goulding as \"The drunken little costdrawer.\" \n Ellmann notes that William Murray, the model for Richie Goulding, did indeed require \"his children to call him 'sir,' and when he was drunk treated them savagely enough. But he was a fair singer of operatic arias, and he was married to a woman whom all the Joyce children, including James, depended upon for help and advice. Josephine Giltrap Murray [\"aunt Sara\" or \"aunt Sally\" Goulding in the novel] was intelligent, resourceful, and unfailingly generous, attributes that could not be too abundant in those harassed lives. She seemed to her nephew James to be a wise woman, and he brought her his shocking problems without shocking her. She had musical training, too, and sometimes she and John Joyce and May would play trios on the piano\" (19-20).\n Simon may be unfairly nasty toward his in-laws, but he is also eloquently witty: \"sirring his father, no less! Sir. Yes, sir. No, sir. Jesus wept: and no wonder, by Christ!\" Here as elsewhere, the strains of Joyce's \"father's voice\" weave their dry irony into the fabric of Ulysses."

  "030009laocoon": {
    "note": " As Stephen listens to his legs moving through space on the beach he recalls two compound words from a work of aesthetics written in 1766 by the poet, playwright, critic, and philosopher Gotthold Lessing. Laocoon opposes the ekphrastic tradition of comparing poetry to painting, arguing instead that the two arts involve very different modes of sensory apprehension. Poetry presents things \"nacheinander\" (after-one-another), while painting presents them \"nebeneinander\" (next-to-one-another).",
    "expandedNote": " Gifford quotes from Edward Allen McCormick's 1962 American translation: \"In the one case the action is visible and progressive, its different parts occurring one after the other (nacheinander) in a sequence of time, and in the other the action is visible and stationary, its different parts developing in co-existence (nebeneinander) in space.\" Poetry is an art of moving through time. Painting is an art of positioning things in space. \n In some of his aesthetic theorizing in the last chapter of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, Stephen had distinguished between spatial and temporal arts: \"An esthetic image is presented to us either in space or in time. What is audible is presented in time, what is visible is presented in space.\" But rather than further differentiating the two kinds of art in that speech, he analyzed the \"esthetic image\" in general, applying several aesthetic terms from Aquinas to define it in general formalist terms. \n In Proteus, he thinks of Lessing's two terms to conceive of two different modes of apprehension, the \"ineluctable modality of the visible\" and the \"ineluctable modality of the audible.\" But he shows none of Lessing's interest in separating the two modes and assigning them to different arts. Listening to his feet drumming out a beat \"Five, six: the nacheinander,\" he thinks also of them \"at the ends of his legs, nebeneinander.\" He is involved in both modalities simultaneously and inextricably, traversing \"A very short space of time through very short times of space.\" \n Ulysses will explore in revolutionary ways this intersection of spatial and temporal modalities. Drawing on modes of apprehension associated with photography, cinema, statuary, music, poetry, drama, and cartography, it offers an expansive vision of the possibilities of literary art. As Stephen says in A Portrait, just after his Aquinian analysis, \"Lessing . . . should not have taken a group of statues to write of. That art, being inferior, does not present the forms I spoke of distinguished clearly from one another.\"\n The allusion to Lessing's work was first noticed by Fritz Senn in an article titled \"Esthetic Theories,\" in JJQ 2.2: 134-36."

  "040090naggin": {
    "note": " In Ireland today a \"naggin\" is a small bottle of liquor in the familiar hip flask shape. (A bottle nearly twice as large, less easily smuggled into events where alcohol is banned, is called a shoulder or daddy naggin.) In Ulysses the word carries the same meaning but can also refer to the liquid measure contained in naggin bottles, or to drinking vessels of that size. It comes from the Irish naigín or noigín (possibly an offshoot of the English \"noggin\"), which originally named a kind of small wooden pail that served as a drinking cup.",
    "expandedNote": " In Calypso Bloom sees an old woman trudging out of a liquor store quite early in the AM, \"clutching a naggin bottle by the neck.\" In Scylla and Charybdis Stephen likens the Athenian magistrates who put Socrates to death to current arbiters of public morality: \"neither the midwife’s lore nor the caudlelectures saved him from the archons of Sinn Fein and their naggin of hemlock.\" Exactly how much fluid is being referenced in these passages hardly matters, but \"naggin\" typically indicates a precise amount, and in its perversely particular way Ithaca forces the reader to assign some little importance to it. The Blooms' kitchen shelves, the chapter observes, hold \"a jug of brown crockery containing a naggin and a quarter of soured adulterated milk, converted by heat into water, acidulous serum and semisolidified curds, which added to the quantity subtracted for Mr Bloom’s and Mrs Fleming’s breakfasts, made one imperial pint, the total quantity originally delivered.\"\n How much of the original pint was used for morning cups of tea before the milk soured and curdled? A British \"imperial pint\" is 568 ml and traditionally a naggin was one quarter of a pint, so it would seem that 177.5 ml of the milk remains (one and a quarter of one quarter). But, to muddy the waters a bit, naggin bottles of liquor in Ireland today hold 200 ml. I do not know when liquor purveyors started making their naggins more generous, but by this standard 250 ml of spoiled milk would be left in the crockery jug. \n The theme of exact measurement also figures in the strangest appearance of the word, near the end of Oxen of the Sun: \"All off for a buster, armstrong, hollering down the street. Bonafides. Where you slep las nigh? Timothy of the battered naggin.\" In one of many \"Trivia Ulysseana\" analyzed in JJQ 19.2 (1982): 151-78, Fritz Senn (following an observation offered by Dubliner Gerald O'Flaherty) notes the relevance of a paper delivered to the Irish National Literary Society in April 1893 by Patrick J. McCall. The paper mentions a private house near St. Patrick's cathedral that became a public one in the 18th century, and that at the beginning of the 19th was owned by a minor nobleman called Sir Timothy O'Brien.\n \"The worthy baronet,\" McCall says, \"appears to have been an eccentric character in his way, and among a certain class of his customers (before he resigned his retail for a wholesale store) he was invariably known as 'The Knight of the Battered Naggin,' recalling Cervantes' Knight of the Golden Basin in Don Quixote. This cognomen of Sir Tim had reference to the dilapidated conditions of his pewter measures by means of which, his customers asserted, the niggard landlord saved a goodly amount of the precious liquor\" (quoted from a reprinting of McCall's paper in the 1976 book In the Shadow of St. Patrick's, p. 26). Among other ways that the story might have found its way into the novel, Senn suggests the possibility that \"the name became locally proverbial for any miserly landlord\" (172). \n Terence Dolan's Dictionary of Hiberno-English cites a couple of colloquial uses of the word and several literary ones, including this from the title song of Finnegans Wake: \"when a noggin of whiskey flew at him.\" Since this action precedes the crucial moment at which some of the precious liquor splashes on Tim and revives him, it seems likely that the \"noggin\" is a drinking vessel rather than a bottle, and indeed some versions of the folk song refer to \"a bucket of whiskey\" rather than a noggin or naggin. Dolan quotes from Peter Martin's 1921 article \"Some Peculiarities of Speech Heard in Breifny\" to the effect that a naggin is \"a wooden vessel made of tiny staves, one of which is longer than the others and forms a handle.\" Dublin pubs had probably long abandoned such wooden cups for metal and glass ones by Joyce's time, but it seems reasonable to assume that in his Dublin a naggin could be either the \"small mug or drinking-vessel\" of Dolan's traditional definition, or the glass bottle of modern liquor stores.\n The traditional wooden cup is the subject of a scholarly study recently published by Claudia Kinmonth. The essay, titled \"Noggins, 'the nicest work of all': traditional Irish wooden vessels for eating and drinking,\" first appeared in Irish Architectural and Decorative Studies: Journal of the Irish Georgian Society 18 (2015): 130-51. After winning an award from the Irish Antique Dealers' Association in 2016, Kinmonth published a revised version in Folk Life: Journal of Ethnological Studies 55.1 (2017): 46-52."

    "note": " Having followed the \"strandentwining cable of all flesh\" back to Eden, Stephen spends one paragraph in Proteus thinking about the First Woman. An assortment of literary texts informs his meditation on \"naked Eve.\" Here and again later in the chapter, he thinks also of Adam before the Fall. He returns to his thoughts about Eve in Oxen of the Sun, and in Wandering Rocks he again recalls a passage from Thomas Traherne's Centuries of Meditations that inspires his thinking about Edenic perfection.",
    "expandedNote": " He might have found in many different texts the notion that \"She had no navel.\" It is not in Genesis, but many theologians have argued that, since neither Adam nor Eve was born in the usual way, they would not have possessed belly buttons. When Michelangelo put a belly button on his Adam in the Sistine Chapel, some theologians accused him of heresy. Thomas Browne devoted an entire chapter of the Pseudodoxia Epidemica to the \"vulgar error\" of painters who depict the First Couple with navels. Most painters through the ages, however, have rejected the smooth-belly hypothesis. The canvas at right is a relative rarity. Stephen prefers to think of such a \"Belly without blemish,\" and in Oxen he thinks again of Eve's body undistorted by the familiar processes of gestation and birth: \"A pregnancy without joy, he said, a birth without pangs, a body without blemish, a belly without bigness.\"\n Thornton hears in \"whiteheaped corn\" an echo of the Song of Solomon: \"Thy navel is like a round goblet, which wanteth not liquor: thy belly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies\" (7:2). Stephen, however, changes \"wheat\" to \"corn\" (a word which meant simply \"grain\" before the modern era): \"no, whiteheaped corn, orient and immortal, standing from everlasting to everlasting.\" This word allows him to pivot to a passage from Thomas Traherne's 17th century prose Meditations. Section 3 of the third Century rapturously recalls a vision of Edenic perfection that the author had when he was a child: \"The Corn was Orient and Immortal Wheat, which never should be reaped, nor was ever sown. I thought it had stood from everlasting to everlasting.\" In this lovely passage, Stephen gets as close as he will to the mystical gazing on perfection that is apparently driving his meditation (\"That is why mystic monks. Will you be as gods? Gaze in your omphalos. . . . Gaze). But, as William York Tindall pointed out in A Reader's Guide to James Joyce (1959), Stephen could not actually have made such an allusion in 1904, because the Centuries were not published in a modern edition until 1908 (148). \n \"Heva\" approximates early Hebrew versions of Eve's name: Cheva/Chawwah, derived from chawah (\"to breathe\") or chayah (\"to live\"). Eve is described as \"Spouse and helpmate\" of Adam in Genesis. \"Adam Kadmon\" is a phrase from the Kabbalah meaning \"original man.\" Thornton notes that \"He includes all of the ten Sephiroth or intelligences which emanated from the En Soph.\" Gifford speculates that Joyce may have taken the phrase from its theosophical elaboration in texts like Helena Blavatsky's Isis Unveiled (1886), but there is nothing in Stephen's sentence to indicate any particular theoretical intention.\n Later in Proteus, Stephen recalls Edenic perfection one last time when he thinks of \"Unfallen Adam rode and not rutted.\" As Gifford puts it, \"According to tradition, before the Fall sexual intercourse was without lust.\""

  "050024nakedwomb": {
    "note": " Bloom's fantasy of floating \"naked, in a womb of warmth,\" admirably illustrated by Frank Budgen in the image accompanying this note, expresses a deep-seated desire which Joyce once declared in a letter to Nora—the desire to return to an original state of human existence. It also culminates a strain of imagery that runs throughout Lotus Eaters—images of comforting cups, tubs, pots, and other containers that contribute to the mood of drugged contentment in the chapter.",
    "expandedNote": " On 5 September 1909 Joyce wrote to Nora, \"O that I could nestle in your womb like a child born of your flesh and blood, be fed by your blood, sleep in the warm secret gloom of your body!\" The impulse goes beyond sexual adoration, into an essentially mystical longing to return to a time before self-consciousness, when the child felt perfectly one with its mother, perfectly safe, nourished, and content. It recurs in Ithaca, when Bloom falls asleep in the posture of \"the childman weary, the manchild in the womb.\" Budgen's drawing, with its egg-shaped uterus of a bathtub, captures this floating tranquility of the wombed manchild. Bloom, like Joyce, associates uterine envelopment with the \"happy warmth\" that for him is a kind of metaphysical condition of life itself.\n The tub at the end of Lotus Eaters continues a long line of earlier images. In the caption to his photograph of the font of holy water in St. Andrew's church, William York Tindall observes that \"This font is only one of the many vessels in a chapter of pots and tubs. Consider Plumtree's Potted Meat and the Gold Cup race. After all, the symbol of the Lotus-eating chapter is the Eucharist and that comes in chalice and ciborium. Eucharistic Bloom sits, at last, in a tub\" (90). Tindall is correct about this pervasive patterning in the chapter. Pots and tubs, no less than drugs, may be judged a defining leitmotif of Lotus Eaters, comparable to the hearts of Hades, the winds of Aeolus, and the foods of Lestrygonians. \n In addition to chalices of holy wine, ciboria of communion wafers, tubs of bathing water, pots of processed meat, and vaginal Cups welcoming phallic Sceptres, Lotus Eaters features the comforting Dead Sea on which bathers float like leaves, the feedbags of the horses at the cabstand, the jar carrying \"lovely cool water\" on the head of the biblical Martha, the paper goblet that Bloom thinks he must take with him to the Phoenix Park races, the pints, quarts, gallons, and barrels of slopping, churning porter whose value he tries to calculate, the \"neat square\" of newspaper sheets in which he lodges his lemon soap, the \"alabaster lilypots\" in which the chemist stores his ingredients and the mortar in which he grinds them, the remembered \"Fleshpots of Egypt,\" and the poster showing a \"cyclist doubled up like a cod in a pot.\" \n Most of these images, perhaps all of them in one way or another, contribute to the sense of drug-like contentment that fills Bloom's consciousness as he imagines soaking in a bathtub at the end of the chapter. Sexual hunger and the torturing anguish of Molly's adultery dissipate as he contemplates his \"limp father of thousands, a languid floating flower.\" His floating penis and his \"navel, bud of flesh,\" lift him out of his tired body into the body of another, the universal mother. Beneath all of our dreams of safety, comfort, and fulfillment lies the primal basin, the original memory of floating in our mothers' wombs."

As the print foreman at the Freeman's Journal he matters to Bloom chiefly as the man who can get Alexander Keyes' ad placed in the paper, but he also figures in the novel as a son of immigrants who attained considerable prominence in Irish politics.",
    "expandedNote": " Born in 1851, fifteen years before the fictional Bloom, Joseph Patrick Nannetti was apprenticed to a printer and became a master of the craft. He entered politics as a trade unionist and nationalist and was elected President of the Dublin Trade Council (1886-88), City Councillor for the Rotunda Ward (1898-1915), Member of Parliament for College Green (1900-15), and Lord Mayor of Dublin (1906-8). Nannetti's trade unionism was of an earlier generation than that of James Larkin and James Connolly, far less militant in pitting workers against employers. His nationalism as a member of Parnell's Irish Parliamentary Party included continued agitation for Home Rule. Although his two terms as Lord Mayor came after the time represented in the novel, Joyce took care to have Alf Bergan observe, in Cyclops, that he was already \"running for the mayoralty\" in 1904. In Aeolus Bloom thinks, \"Soon be calling him my lord mayor. Long John is backing him, they say.\"\n Bloom talks to Nannetti in his little \"reading closet\" in theFreeman offices about publishing Keyes' ad. Later, in one of the intruding scenes in Wandering Rocks, the councillor is seen \"On the steps of the City hall\" greeting two other members of the Dublin Corporation. In Cyclops,Joe Hynes tells the other men in the pub that in the evening Nannetti will be \"going off by the mailboat\" to London to speak on the floor of the House of Commons \"about the commissioner of police forbidding Irish games\" in Phoenix Park, and about \"taking action in the matter\" of foot-and-mouth disease. Bloom is disappointed to hear of Nannetti's departure, because he had been hoping to speak to him again about the ad. In real life, no one in Dublin could have spoken to Nannetti at any time on June 16; according to the Evening Telegraph, he was in Westminster addressing Parliament that afternoon.\n The mailboat departed each evening at 8:15. Near the end of Nausicaa, which begins at about 8:00, Bloom thinks, inaccurately, that Nannetti must be nearly to Wales by now: \"Nannetti’s gone. Mailboat. Near Holyhead by now. Must nail that ad of Keyes’s. Work Hynes and Crawford.\" This reverie takes shape again in Circe as a fantasy of Nannetti being out in Dublin Bay on the Erin's King, like Bloom with his daughter Milly. \n The implied identification between the two men insinuates a thought that is never made explicit in the novel: how, Bloom must wonder, has this son of foreigners become such an important person in Dublin? Dennis Breen of the Brini clan has earned only suspicion and contempt. The ambitious son of a Hungarian Jew born Virag has not fared much better. But Nannetti has been accepted and entrusted with political authority. Even in the xenophobic and misanthropic confines of Barney Kiernan's pub no one slanders him. Joe Hynes, a fellow newspaperman, calls him by the familiar \"Nannan\" and refers to him as \"The mimber,\" which Slote glosses as simply a western Irish pronunciation of \"member,\" i.e. M.P. \n Bloom's closest approach to forming such thoughts comes in Sirens. As he walks along Wellington Quay and gazes on \"Ceppi's virgins, bright of their oils,\" he recollects that \"Nannetti's father hawked those things about, wheedling at doors as I. Religion pays. Must see him about Keyes's par.\" Peter Ceppi & Sons sold Blessed Virgin statues at 8-9 Wellington Quay, so the implication is that Nannetti's father sold such icons by knocking on doors. Bloom's father too was a door-to-door salesman, and after Bloom left high school he took up his destined place in that line of work. He has moved on to other occupations, but ad canvassing is not so far removed from door-to-door sales, and it has not led him to the career as a Lord Mayor or magistrate that he fantasizes about in Circe and Ithaca.\n One advantage of an Italian-Irishman, of course, would be the Roman Catholicism that the two cultures share—as Bloom notes when he thinks, \"Religion pays.\" Ceppi and his sons were not the only Italian-Irish artisans to fill the BVM niche. Many commentators have traced Nannetti's origins to an Italian \"sculptor and modeller\" who sold his work at 6 Great Brunswick Street in the 1840s and 50s. Some have inferred that his father must have been Giacomo Nannetti, who owned this business. But Harald Beck, in an article on James Joyce Online Notes, has argued that it was not Giacomo but his Italian-born nephew Giuseppe (Joseph) who fathered Joseph Patrick. Giuseppe helped run the business, and it would appear that neither nephew nor uncle \"hawked\" Virgin Mary statues door-to-door. That wrinkle on the historical record is fiction, imagined either by Joyce or by Bloom himself to allow Bloom to think about what he has in common with Nannetti.\n Since both of the small changes that Joyce made to the life of the actual Joseph Patrick Nannetti lead to Bloom being imaginatively associated with the Councillor, it seems justifiable to infer that he regards his older, more powerful, and very socially prominent co-worker with some mixture of admiration, inspiration, consternation, and/or envy. Bloom must see in Nannetti signs of what is, or is not, possible for an ethnically heterogeneous \"mimber\" of Dublin society."

  "030106nappertandy": {
    "note": " As Kevin Egan sings some of The boys of Kilkenny to Stephen, he takes his hand: \"Weak wasting hand on mine.\" The touch, and the song's mention of exilic longing, make Stephen think of another song that contains both elements: \"He takes me, Napper Tandy, by the hand.\" The allusion is to The Wearing of the Green, a street ballad commemorating the uprising of the 1790s.",
    "expandedNote": " General James Napper Tandy was one of the founders of the United Irishmen, a group of pan-denominational (but predominantly Protestant) activists centered in Dublin and Belfast, who were inspired by the French Revolution in 1789 and the publication of Thomas Paine's The Rights of Man in 1791. The group originally sought parliamentary reform of the existing political system but, confronted with British repression, it drifted toward republicanism, and in 1795 it made common cause with the secret Catholic agrarian organization called the Defenders. In the same year Tandy fled to the United States, and in 1798 he moved to Paris to join Theobald Wolfe Tone and others who were plotting an uprising assisted by a French invasion force. In September 1798 he captained a French corvette filled with troops and arms to Donegal, where he unsuccessfully sought to foment rebellion. \n The song, which Gifford notes was \"formalized\" in the late 19th century by the Irish-American actor and writer Dion Boucicault, appears to present Tandy at some point during the three years of his exile. The second stanza of the ballad begins, \"I met with Napper Tandy, and he took me by the hand, / And he said, 'How's dear old Ireland, and how does she stand?'\" (In Circe Old Gummy Granny echoes the second of these lines: \"You met with poor old Ireland and how does she stand?\") The answer is that Ireland is faring very poorly: \"She's the most distressful country that ever yet was seen; / They're hanging men and women there for wearing of the green.\" The United Irishmen had adopted green as their color, and citizens were wearing green ribbons or items of clothing (or sometimes, the song suggests, shamrocks) to demonstrate their support. The British authorities responded with typical brutality, declaring the wearing of green an act of sedition punishable by death.\n Thornton notes that in the lecture titled \"Ireland, Island of Saints and Sages,\" delivered in Trieste in 1907, Joyce mentions Tandy as one of the \"heroes of the modern movement.\" Stephen's thoughts seem to cohere with that assessment. He imagines Kevin Egan, an insurrectionist living in exile in Paris, as an avatar of another insurrectionist living in Paris a century earlier. In this drama, Stephen plays the role of the visitor from Ireland whom Tandy asks for news of his native land. But of course Stephen too (like Joyce) thinks of himself as an exile determined to improve Ireland from abroad, so the gleam reflected from Tandy may burnish his aura as well."

    "note": " The National Library of Ireland and its architectural twin, the National Museum, face each other across a square on Kildare Street, in the heart of fashionable Dublin between Trinity College to the north, Merrion Square to the east, and St. Stephen’s Green to the south. Scylla and Charybdis takes place in the library, as Stephen presents his views on Shakespeare's life and work. At the same time, but off-screen, Bloom is paying a visit to the National Museum to inspect a plaster reproduction of a Greek statue. He enters the library about halfway through the chapter to look at a back issue of a newspaper.",
    "expandedNote": " In Telemachus, before Mulligan and Stephen discuss the talk that Stephen will give there, Haines mentions his plan \"to visit your national library today.\" Gifford notes that in the late 19th century the National Library was associated with “efforts to preserve records and keep the Irish language and culture alive,” which no doubt accounts for Haines' pilgrimage there. Although Haines has asked to hear “your idea of Hamlet,” he is not present in the library when Stephen propounds it.\n In Lestrygonians, thinking about the ad for Alexander Keyes that he intends to model on an ad that ran earlier, Bloom tells himself, \"Must look up that ad in the national library.\" Later in the same chapter, he reminds himself again, this time thinking specifically of the newspaper which ran the ad: \"That Kilkenny People in the national library now I must.\" But when he heads in that direction at the end of the chapter, he goes first to the National Museum on the other side of the plaza: \"Making for the museum gate with long windy strides he lifted his eyes. Handsome building. Sir Thomas Deane designed.\" \n Two architects of this name designed the two buildings in the 1880s: Sir Thomas Newenham Deane and his son Sir Thomas Manly Deane. (The father's father too, a third Sir Thomas Deane, was an Irish architect who designed the Trinity College Museum earlier in the century.) The buildings are grandly eclectic. As Bloom looks at one of them (probably the Museum) he again thinks approvingly of the architecture: \"His eyes beating looked steadfastly at cream curves of stone. Sir Thomas Deane was the Greek architecture.\" Gifford comments that Newenham Deane and Manly Deane \"practiced in a rather restrained and heavy way the 'Renaissance style' taught and advocated by the École des Beaux Arts in Paris; while it is technically incorrect to call this style 'Greek,' the handling of columns and pediments is somewhat reminiscent of Greek architecture.\" \n Stephen's Shakespeare talk takes place in the office of the library's director, Thomas Lyster. Partway through the talk, the director's attention is called to the arrival of Bloom: \"— Mr Lyster, an attendant said from the door ajar . . . There's a gentleman here, sir, the attendant said, coming forward and offering a card. From the Freeman. He wants to see the files of the Kilkenny People for last year.\" As Lyster busies off to help Bloom find his way to the newspapers, Buck Mulligan, who has arrived in the library not much earlier, snatches up the calling card Bloom has presented to the attendant and says, \"I found him over in the museum where I went to hail the foamborn Aphrodite.\" Lyster oversaw a staff of 15 who helped patrons find what they were looking for in the entirely noncirculating collection of library holdings. As Hugh Kenner notes in his foreword to Joseph O'Brien's Dear, Dirty Dublin (1982), these employees were kept busy serving a very large number of patrons, most of them college students. \n Near the end of Scylla and Charybdis, Stephen follows Mulligan out of the office, through \"The constant readers' room\" (the grand showpiece of the building's interior), past \"The turnstile,\" down a staircase, and into \"The pillared Moorish hall, shadows entwined.\" The men are now in the ground-floor entrance hall, a beautiful blue and white room whose Corinthian columns echo the columns on the building's exterior. It cannot be called Moorish in any strict sense, but does have an exotic otherworldly flavor that apparently appeals to Stephen's fascination with things Islamic. At the door, as he is about to leave the building, Stephen stands aside to let an unnamed man, Bloom, pass between himself and Mulligan, and he thinks, \"The portico. / Here I watched the birds for augury.\" The portico is a semicircular covered porch with stone steps leading down to the Kildare Street sidewalk. \n In section 5 of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, Stephen stood on the portico steps and watched the birds in the sky the way ancient Roman augurs did: \"What birds were they? He stood on the steps of the library to look at them, leaning wearily on his ashplant. They flew round and round the jutting shoulder of a house in Molesworth Street. . . . They were flying high and low but ever round and round in straight and curving lines and ever flying from left to right, circling about a temple of air. . . . Why was he gazing upwards from the steps of the porch, hearing their shrill twofold cry, watching their flight? For an augury of good or evil? . . . And for ages men had gazed upward as he was gazing at birds in flight. The colonnade above him made him think vaguely of an ancient temple and the ashplant on which he leaned wearily of the curved stick of an augur.\" \n Fargnoli and Gillespie note that \"In Joyce's time the National Library served as a gathering place for students from University College, Dublin (at that time located just south of the library across St Stephen's Green), and a number of episodes in the fifth chapter of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man are set at and around the library.\" \n As Mulligan and Stephen stand on the portico, they see Bloom's \"dark back\" go before them, step of a pard, down, out by the gateway, under portcullis barbs.\" This is the ironwork gate, marked \"Library\" in gilt letters and topped with spikes, that leads out to Kildare Street. Bloom has entered its \"Museum\" counterpart at the end of Lestrygonians.\n The near-meeting of the two protagonists in the library is retrospectively acknowledged in Ithaca, when Bloom and Stephen make tentative plans to meet again to continue their conversation. One of the many places proposed for such future meetings is \"the National Library of Ireland, 10 Kildare street.\" Later in Ithaca, Bloom again recalls his \"visit to museum and national library\" earlier in the day."

Fresh air helps memory.\" In Hades the funeral procession takes him by another \"National school,\" this one called Saint Andrew's though it is not named in the narrative. The National Schools were public schools, funded by the government, that served students of the lower middle class and emphasized vocational education. In theory, at least, they embraced all religious denominations and strictly separated religious instruction from the rest of the curriculum.",
    "expandedNote": "The National School system, established by an Act of Parliament in 1831, was administered by a National Board of Education consisting of two members each from the Catholic church, the Presbyterian church, and the Church of Ireland. For early 19th century Irish Catholics emerging from the hedge school arrangements necessitated by the 18th century penal laws, the schools represented a chance of equal opportunity and social integration. But all three churches resisted the constraints on their ability to shape the course of education. Although they failed to change the law, they did manage to influence practice within particular schools, and many parents sought out schools that catered to their particular faith. According to an article in the 1 September 2017 issue of the Irish Examiner, by the end of the 19th century denominational adherence was threatening to undermine the system.\n St. Joseph's school was at 81-84 Upper Dorset Street, and St. Andrew's was at 114-21 Great Brunswick Street. These buildings still stand today, though neither one remains a school. And the National School system in Ireland continues, still government-run and non-denominational."

Shakespeare is famous for examples like Iago's \"put but money in thy purse\" and Antony's \"For Brutus is an honourable man.\" As a rhetorical tool, the point is usually to persuade or excite passion by repetition and variation.

  "070006nelsonspillar": {
    "note": " \"Nelson's pillar\" was an immense monument toAdmiral Horatio Nelson in the middle of Sackville (or O'Connell) Street in the heart of downtown Dublin. Appearing first in Hades as the funeral cortège rolls by, it then figures prominently in Aeolus as the central dispatch point for Dublin's trams, and as the setting for Stephen's Parable of the Plums.",
    "expandedNote": " Nelson's pillar was the originating point for most of Dublin's trams. From this hub, tramlines radiated in all directions (but especially south and southeast) to the city's suburbs. The destinations that the \"timekeeper\" bawls out at the beginning of Aeolus are mostly in the prosperous southern suburbs, but, as illustrated here by pages reproduced from a schedule, tramlines also ran west to such destinations as Palmerstown Park (which is among the names called out), Inchicore, Park Gate, and Phoenix Park, east to the poor suburb of Ringsend (also mentioned), north to Glasnevin and Drumcondra, and northeast to Dollymount and the poor inner-city distrinct of Ballybough. There was also a tram to the far northeastern village of Howth. In Proteus Stephen recalls a time when he rode \"on the top of the Howth tram,\" and in Eumaeus Bloom thinks that the natural splendor of the Howth cliff walk is easily accessible from the city, \"it being only three quarters of an hour's run from the pillar.\" \n In Hades, the pillar is one of a number of sights that register in the narrative as the funeral carriages roll north on Sackville Street: Elvery's, statues commemorating Daniel O'Connell, Sir John Gray, and Father Mathew, and the Rotunda. All but O'Connell's statue appear again in Sirens, as Blazes Boylan retraces Bloom's path, rolling north on Sackville Street in ajaunting car toward his appointment with Molly. \n In February 1808, several decades before Nelson's Column was erected in Trafalgar Square in London, work began on a foundation stone for the pillar in central Dublin, smack in the middle of Sackville Street. By late 1809 an immense granite Doric column had been constructed on the foundation, topped with a statue of Lord Nelson carved in Portland limestone by the Cork sculptor Thomas Kirk. The column enclosed 168 stone stairs spiraling to the top, which afforded an impressive view of greater Dublin to those willing to pay the entrance price. When the second photo of the pillar reproduced here is expanded, the iron railing that protected visitors who climbed up for the view can be seen below the statue.\n All the traffic from people catching trams to various parts of the city, or coming to enter the momument, made the pillar's base a natural spot for sellers to hawk flowers and food. As Paddy Dignam's funeral procession passes by the pillar in Hades, a girl is selling plums to tourists and locals coming to take in the view: \"—Eight plums a penny! Eight for a penny!\" Stephen takes these calls as the inspiration for his narrative vignette in the next chapter. His two elderly vestals, Florence MacCabe and Anne Kearns, \"want to see the views of Dublin from the top of Nelson's pillar.\" They buy bread and pressed meat, plus \"four and twenty ripe plums from a girl at the foot of Nelson's pillar,\" pay threepence each for admission to the staircase, and \"begin to waddle slowly up the winding staircase,\" exclaiming wearily at the distance and \"peeping at the airslits.\" On the platform at the top of the stairs they eat their lunch, and then \"go nearer to the railings\" for the dizzying view: \"Rathmines' blue dome, Adam and Eve's, saint Laurence O'Toole's.\" \n Nelson's statue and the top half of the pillar were crudely demolished by IRA explosives in March 1966, in what is generally supposed to have marked a 50-year commemoration of the Easter Rising which began less than a block away, at the General Post Office. Today, the modernist Spire of Dublin rises from the spot on which the pillar once stood. \n The IRA bombing may have inspired revenge attacks by loyalists in 1971. Their three bombings utterly destroyed a statue of Theobald Wolfe Tone and obliterated the staircase inside Daniel O'Connell's round tower, but left O'Connell's monument on O'Connell Street largely unscathed."

  "020000nestor": {
    "note": " Episode 2, \"Nestor,\" shows Stephen outside of his bohemian digs, in the adult world of earning a living. He has walked about a mile southeast from the Sandycove tower to the town of Dalkey, where he is employed in a private boys' school owned and run by a man named Garrett Deasy. Joyce maps this realistic action onto some of the events in Books 2 and 3 of the Odyssey, which show Telemachus moving into the world of manly action. The events narrated in the chapter probably begin at about 9:30 and end at about 10:30.",
    "expandedNote": " Homer shows Telemachus taking action first by calling an assembly of the men of Ithaca to condemn the suitors' depradations, and, when that fails, by voyaging to Pylos and Sparta on the Greek mainland to see what Nestor and Menelaus may know of his father. Nestor receives him hospitably and tells him the relevant story of what happened to Agamemnon when he returned home, but he has no information about Odysseus. Stephen's case is worse: Deasy afflicts him with unsought and aggressive advice, and Stephen actively resists the headmaster's assumption of intellectual authority.\n Joyce's narrative clearly associates Deasy with Nestor. The portraits of \"vanished horses\" on the walls of his study—champion racehorses from the 1860s, 70s, and 80s—echo Nestor's reputation as \"the prince of charioteers,\" a reputation that is illustrated when Nestor sends Telemachus and his son Peisistratus off to Sparta behind a pair of \"thoroughbreds, a racing team.\" The concern for cattle that Deasy shows in writing his letter about foot-and-mouth disease reflects the monumental sacrifice of bulls that greets Telemachus when he arrives at Pylos, as well as the sacrifice of a prize heifer to Athena the next day. There are many additional echoes, but Joyce's episode engages with Homer's most crucially on the theme of a young man seeking advice from an old one. Athena urges Telemachus to learn from Nestor:\n \"Go to old Nestor, master charioteer, \n so we may broach the storehouse of his mind.\n Ask him with courtesy, and in his wisdom\n he will tell you history and no lies.\"\n But clear-headed Telémakhos replied:\n \"Mentor, how can I do it, how approach him?\n I have no practice in elaborate speeches, and\n for a young man to interrogate an old man\n Seems disrespectful—\"\n Despite this veneration for the old man's wisdom, Nestor does not have any actionable information. His knowledge of Odysseus' whereabouts ends with the departure from Troy. Joyce took this deflation of patriarchal wisdom considerably further. Mr. Deasy tells Stephen (who has not asked) a boatload of \"history,\" including the United Irishmen rebellion of the 1790s, the Act of Union in 1800-1, Daniel O'Connell's parliamentary reform movements in the first half of the 19th century, the famine of the 1840s, and the fenian conspiracy of the 1860s. But his Protestant unionist perspective on these events is one that Stephen can hardly embrace. And his aggressively partisan position is undermined by many, many \"lies.\"\n For Stephen, Deasy's biased memories are not simply inaccurate. They are depressingly representative of history in general, which is written by the winners and effaces the losers. In Deasy's complacent unionist view, \"All human history moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God.\" In Stephen's subjected condition, history is \"a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.\" Joyce named history as the \"art\" of Nestor in both of his schemas. It is an art whose practice depends hugely on one's subject position.\n According to the Linati schema, the episode takes place from 9 to 10 AM. According to Gilbert's, the time is 10-11 AM. Neither of these on-the-hour times fits precisely with the details that can be found in the text or inferred from it. The chapter begins in the middle of a lesson, so the time must be later than 9:00, since Telemachus ended at 8:45 and it must have taken Stephen at least 15 minutes to walk the mile from the Sandycove tower to Dalkey Avenue. It is impossible to say exactly how long the lessons have been going on, but not very much textual time elapses before the boys remind Stephen that they have \"Hockey at ten, sir.\" Estimating backward from this hour to account for the history and literature lessons that we hear narrated, for Stephen's riddle, and for his tutoring of Sargent while the boys dress for the match and Deasy sorts the teams, one may reckon that the action of the chapter begins somewhere around 9:30. \n The conversation between Stephen and Deasy in the headmaster's office must begin at about the same time as the boys' recess, 10:00, and it occupies slightly more than half the chapter. An estimate of 10:30 would fit with the time frame of Lotus Eaters, preserving the temporal parallels that Joyce evidently intended between Stephen's first three chapters and Bloom's. It clashes, however, with the time of 10:00 that Clive Hart infers from his account of how Stephen travels from Dalkey to Sandymount Strand between Nestor and Proteus (James Joyce's Dublin, 27-32). Persuasive as Hart's account of Stephen's movements is, it seems impossible that his conversation with Deasy could conclude by 10:00."

  "030097neverbeasaint": {
    "note": "Having thought about the great Irish prose writer Jonathan Swift as a \"hater of his kind\" and a tortured genius, Stephen now recalls something that the great English poet John Dryden said to Swift: \"Cousin Swift, you will never be a poet.\" He applies the saying to his own earlier religiosity: \"Cousin Stephen, you will never be a saint.\"",
    "expandedNote": " As Thornton notes, the anecdote comes from Samuel Johnson's Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets (1779-81). Johnson's biography of Swift is frequently critical (Boswell often observes that he had an inveterate prejudice against the Dean), and it begins with a snide glance at the question of the writer's nationality: “He was contented to be called an Irishman by the Irish; but would occasionally call himself an Englishman. The question may, without much regret, be left in the obscurity in which he delighted to involve it.”\n Not long after comes the anecdote: \"Swift began early to think, or to hope, that he was a poet, and wrote Pindarick Odes to Temple, to the King, and to the Athenian Society, a knot of obscure men, who published a periodical pamphlet of answers to questions, sent, or supposed to be sent, by Letters. I have been told that Dryden, having perused these verses, said, 'Cousin Swift you will never be a poet'; and that this denunciation was the motive of Swift’s perpetual malevolence to Dryden.\"\n Anthony Burgess notes that the saying could apply just as effectively to Joyce, who had a \"slender\" poetic talent that \"had to be enclosed in the irony of the great prose books for it to be effective. His verse talent is, in fact, close to that of Swift (Dryden was, of course and as always, right), and this is appropriate for the second man to draw great prose out of Ireland\" (ReJoyce, 80). Stephen, who styles himself a poet but has few and slight poetic accomplishments, does not recognize the challenge to his own literary art. Instead, he genially mocks his youthful piety—a less threatening failure than his poetic pretensions."

  "120001jewishstate": {
    "note": " Amid all the talk about \"nations,\" the Citizen implies that Bloom, as the son of a Hungarian Jew, is not really Irish: \"What is your nation if I may ask.\" Bloom's reply is immediate and unambiguous: \"Ireland . . . I was born here. Ireland.\" Racial ancestry, even cultural and religious affiliation are one thing; citizenship and national loyalty are something else entirely. This sensible duality is lost on the monomaniacal Citizen, who replies contemptuously by spitting a gob of phlegm onto the floor. When Bloom rises to the bait, courageously asserting that his \"race\" has been subjected to at least as much persecution as the Irish have, the Citizen hits him with the European backlash against Zionism: \"Are you talking about the new Jerusalem?\"",
    "expandedNote": " The \"new Jerusalem\" has a long Christian history (beginning in Revelation 21-22) as a figure for the heavenly city, but the Citizen's barb contains a much sharper point: he alludes to the growing movement among European Jews in the last few decades of the 19th century to return to their ancestral homeland in Palestine and to found a nation there. The revival, in those decades, of old ethnic hatreds under the new banner of \"anti-Semitism\" convinced many Jews that their millennial efforts to assimilate into the Christian nations of Europe had failed and could never succeed. In 1896, one of the most passionate and influential of these Zionists, a Hungarian journalist named Theodor (Tivadar) Herzl, published a rousing call to found a new nation.\n The pamphlet that Herzl titled The Jewish State (1896) makes the same distinction that Bloom does, between ethnicity or religion on the one hand and nationhood on the other. But he comes to a different conclusion: \"I think the Jewish question is no more a social than a religious one, notwithstanding that it sometimes takes these and other forms. It is a national question, which can only be solved by making it a political world-question to be discussed and settled by the civilized nations of the world in council. We are a people—one people. We have honestly endeavored everywhere to merge ourselves in the social life of surrounding communities and to preserve the faith of our fathers. We are not permitted to do so. In vain are we loyal patriots, our loyalty in some places running to extremes; in vain do we make the same sacrifices of life and property as our fellow-citizens; in vain do we strive to increase the fame of our native land in science and art, or her wealth by trade and commerce. In countries where we have lived for centuries we are still cried down as strangers, and often by those whose ancestors were not yet domiciled in the land where Jews had already had experience of suffering\" (from the Introduction, translated by Sylvie D'Avigdor, Jewishvirtuallibrary.org, accessed 3/20/2013).\n Herzl's energetic efforts to convince the great powers of Europe (the Ottoman Empire among them) to sponsor an autonomous Jewish state in Palestine did not succeed in his lifetime. He died in 1904, only 18 days after the day represented in Ulysses. The aggressive response that his proposal elicits from the Citizen confirms his contention that, in the eyes of European non-Jews, Jews can do no right: their desire for independence elicits just as much scorn as does their desire for assimilation. Bloom is no Zionist, but even his earnest efforts to be recognized as a true Irishman mark him as a subversive agitator for a foreign nation."

    "expandedNote": " The newspaper that Bloom reads in Eumaeus discloses that on the morning of June 16 \"the remains of the late Mr Patrick Dignam were removed from his residence, no 9 Newbridge Avenue, Sandymount, for interment in Glasnevin.\" This, then, is the originating point for the funeral procession narrated in the first half ofHades. The carriages travel north from Sandymount through Irishtown toRingsend, then move west through the southern part of central Dublin, cross the Liffey and turn north up O'Connell Street, and from the top of that street they proceed northwest to Prospect cemetery in the near northern suburb of Glasnevin.\n [2018] In the Hades written in the Rosenbach manuscript and the one published in 1918 in the Little Review, Joyce housed Paddy Dignam's family at No. 10 Newbridge Avenue, but in the 1922 edition of the novel they live at No. 9. Apparently he changed his plans when he learned from the 1904 Thom's directory that No. 9 was vacant."

Writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel nowadays.\" Stephen takes no more interest in this proposal than he did when it came from the mouth of Myles Crawford in Aeolus, but Bloom is right about the abundant opportunities. An astonishing number of morning, evening, and weekly papers circulated in 1904 Dublin, no fewer than 16 of them mentioned in Ulysses. Most hold some literary interest, whether for the people, events, and politics represented in the novel, or for characters in the stories of Dubliners, or for Joyce's own early publishing efforts.",
    "expandedNote": "Turn-of-the-century Irish papers combined news stories with business and classified ads (typically filling the first page, to the dismay of readers of later papers), public announcements, editorial essays, sports features, parliamentary and court proceedings, transcripts of speeches, financial market prices, personal portraits, obituaries, drawings, and photographs. Unlike many later papers, many of these publications also regularly featured poems, short stories, book reviews, and literary essays. \n The three largest news dailies, in terms of circulation, were the Freeman's Journal, the Evening Telegraph, and the Irish Times. The unionist Times and the nationalist Freeman appeared in the morning, along with the unionist Daily Express and the nationalist Irish Independent. The nationalist Telegraph came out in the evening, along with the unionist Dublin Evening Mail and two papers not mentioned in the novel, the Dublin Evening Standard and the Evening Herald. It seems likely that some London dailies were also sold in Dublin, given the twice-daily schedules of the Holyhead mailboats, but the novel mentions only the brutal attitudes toward Ireland expressed in the conservative London Times in the 1840s.\n In addition to all the daily newspapers, various Irish and English weeklies circulated on the streets of Dublin. In AeolusMyles Crawford hunts for a back issue of the \"Weekly Freeman\" as he tells the story of Ignatius Gallaher's journalistic coup, and Lenehan comes in with an issue of \"Sport,\" another weekly published by Freeman's Journal, Ltd. (The front door of the building, we learn at the beginning of the chapter, sports \"newsboards of the Weekly Freeman and National Press and the Freeman's Journal and National Press.\") \n In Hades Bloom thinks of reading \"the Church Times. Marriage ads they never try to beautify.\"Gifford observes that this \"weekly Church of England newspaper, quite conservative and High Church in its views,\" did publish \"an impressive number of genteel personal want ads.\" InLestrygonians Bloom thinks of \"the Irish Field,\" a Dublin-produced Saturday issue which Gifford notes was \"devoted to the interests of country gentlemen,\" and Slote describes as a \"weekly racing newspaper.\"Ithaca records that his desk drawer contains \"a press cutting from an English weekly periodical Modern Society, subject corporal chastisement in girls' schools.\" \n Like the Sunday magazines of the New York Times and some other American newspapers today, these weekly publications appear to have subordinated the reporting of current events to longer pieces of less topical interest. In Aeolus Bloom thinks, \"It's the ads and side features sell a weekly, not the stale news in the official gazette.\" Many of the weeklies also featured poems and stories. Ithaca recalls how a young Leopold Bloom entered a poem in a competition to be published in \"the Shamrock, a weekly newspaper\" (Gifford notes that this too was an actual publication, produced by the Irish National Printing and Publishing Company on Abbey Street), and Calypso shows him envying Mr. Philip Beaufoy, who has published a story called \"Matcham's Masterstroke\" in an English weekly, Tit-Bits, which published extracts from books and newspapers around the world, as well as original works of literary fiction.\n The United Irishman, a nationalist paper which inspired a fictional story about an African chieftain that is read aloud in Cyclops, also appeared weekly. One more English weekly in the pages ofCalypso deserves mention, though it stretches the definition of \"newspaper\" even farther than does Tit-Bits. Racy photographs were the chief draw of Photo Bits, but like Tit-Bitsthis journal also published comical snippets and complete short stories. \n § Although Philip Beaufoy is fictional, his story closely resembles one that Joyce himself submitted to Tit-Bits on a lark as a teenager. In his twenties, the writer regularly supported himself with short newspaper columns. On 7 April 1903 he published an interview with a French race-car driver in the Irish Times that later gave him material for the Dubliners story \"After the Race.\" From December 1902 to November 1903 he wrote no fewer than 21 book reviews for the Daily Express. From August to December of 1904 he published drafts of three other Dubliners stories in an agriculturally oriented weekly called the Irish Homestead, under the pen name Stephen Dedalus. From 1907 to 1912, while living in Trieste, he placed nine different articles in that city's most important newspaper, Il Piccolo della Sera. \n Given Joyce's involvement with at least four Irish papers and one Italian one, it seems clear that Bloom's recommendation of \"Writing for the newspapers\" should not be regarded as clueless Philistinism. He represents adult work experiences of the author and gives Stephen actionable information."

    "note": " \"Get another of Paul de Kock's. Nice name he has\": Molly's mind is no less filled with organs than her husband's is. Her remark in Calypso would be less funny had Joyce simply made the name up, but in fact Monsieur de Kock was a popular writer of mid-19th century Paris. In addition to the lewd double entendre, \"Paul de\" sounds like Molly's affectionate nickname for her husband: Poldy. So this is a \"nice name\" in several senses.",
    "expandedNote": " Charles-Paul de Kock (1793-1871) was born into a family of Dutch descent living in Paris. He wrote novels at a clip rivalling Balzac's and with subject matters resembling Dickens'. Though less brilliant than either of these literary giants, he enjoyed huge popularity throughout France. Most of his stories concerned the lives of middle-class Parisians: seamstresses, flower girls, milkmaids, shopgirls, clerks, barbers. He did not hesitate to imitate coarse details of ordinary life. Gifford cites an Edwardian judgment that \"His novels are vulgar but not unmoral.\" \n Molly, however, assumes that de Kock is a lewd pseudonym. InPenelope, she thinks, \"Mr de Kock I suppose the people gave him that nickname going about with his tube from one woman to another.\" In Sirens the suggestive name becomes elided with Boylan's penis as he stands at the Blooms' front door, rapping with the metal door knocker: \"One rapped on a door, one tapped with a knock, did he knock Paul de Kock with a loud proud knocker with a cock carracarracarra cock. Cockcock.\" \n In Circe the Kock-centered adulterous meeting becomes Bloom's fault when Mrs. Yelverton Barry accuses him in court : \"I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following Thursday, Dunsink time. He offered to send me through the post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled The Girl with the Three Pairs of Stays.\" La Femme aux Trois Corsets (1878) was one of de Kock's novels. Later in Circe, when \"Mute inhuman faces throng forward\" to hear Bloom's answer to Bello's demand, \"What was the most revolting piece of obscenity in all your career of crime?,\" one of them is \"Poldy Kock.\" \n Most of these later references to de Kock in Ulysses call attention to Molly's infidelity with Boylan, and indeed Joyce owned a copy of de Kock’s Le Cocu (The Cuckold) when he was living in Trieste. But Poldy Kock turns Molly's \"nice name\" into a domestic endearment, as Harry Blamires notes in The New Bloomsday Book (26). Whether or not she is conscious of this meaning, Molly's affection for the name Paul de Kock holds out some hope that her sexual passion for her spouse is not dead."

  "150005nighttown": {
    "note": " The 15th chapter of Ulysses, usually called Circe, takes place in Dublin's red-light district. Joyce calls it \"nighttown,\" but most Dubliners in 1904 knew it as the Monto, because Montgomery Street ran along one edge. It was also strongly identified with the former Mecklenburgh Street (Tyrone Street in 1904). Most of the action of the chapter takes place in what Ithaca calls \"the disorderly house of Mrs Bella Cohen, 82 Tyrone street, lower.\" The area was only a few blocks east of the busy hub of Sackville Street.",
    "expandedNote": " Lynch refers to Tyrone Street in commenting on Stephen's strange conversational habits: \"Pornosophical philotheology. Metaphysics in Mecklenburgh street!\" Buck Mulligan too: \"I called upon the bard Kinch at his summer residence in upper Mecklenburgh street and found him deep in the study of the Summa contra Gentiles in the company of two gonorrheal ladies, Fresh Nelly and Rosalie, the coalquay whore.\"\n Pearl observes that in addition to a high number of illegal streetwalkers (586 were arrested in 1904, more than double the rate per capita in London that year), \"Dublin had, unlike London, a considerable population of whores who functioned lawfully in brothels.\" He quotes from the Encyclopaedia Britannica: \"Dublin seems to form an exception to the usual practice in the United Kingdom. In that city police permit open brothels confined to one area, but carried on more openly than in the South of Europe or even Algiers\" (10). The History Ireland website quotes the words of a medical student named Halliday Sutherland, who walked down Tyrone Street one evening in 1904: \"in no other capital of Europe have I seen its equal. It was a street of Georgian houses and each one was a brothel. On the steps of every house women and girls dressed in everything from evening dress to a nightdress stood or sat\" (www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/monto, accessed 3 February 2014). \n Conditions are much different now. Montgomery Street has become Foley Street, and Tyrone Street is Railroad Street. Pearl noted in 1969 that \"Today most of Monto has vanished in a waste of parking-lots and corporation flats; but Mabbot Lane, running from Talbot Street to Railway Street, survives.\" The closet drama that is Circe opens at \"The Mabbot street entrance of nighttown,\" and it is not an elegant location. Pearl: \"There were sharp class distinctions in Monto. The most select part was the upper end of Tyrone Street, where the Georgian houses retained some of their elegance and the whores wore fashionable evening dress and were visited regularly by their couturier. Less fastidious were their sisters at the lower end, and in Mabbot Street and Faithful Place, who wore only raincoats which they flicked open occasionally to stimulate trade. In these humbler establishments, 'coshes' of lead pipe were often concealed behind the gaudy religious pictures that brightened the walls\" (11). Bella Cohen's seems to lie between the extremes that Pearl describes, but closer to the lower end."

    "note": " Near the end of Telemachus, an old man pops to the surface of the swimming hole and clambers up the rocks, seawater running off of his body and bathing trunks. Glancing at Stephen and Haines, Mulligan crosses himself, to indicate that the swimmer is a priest. His information is confirmed later when the narrative mentions \"The priest's grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly.\" The nimbus seems to refer to a \"garland of grey hair\" seen earlier on the old man, and the niche to a gap between rocks on the shore where he can modestly remove his swimsuit, but both words have religious overtones.",
    "expandedNote": " \"Nimbus\" (Latin for cloud) is a plausibly descriptive detail for a small bit of hair seen from a distance. In the works of antiquity, gods often concealed themselves in dark clouds or haloes of light when they appeared to human beings. Virgil’s Aeneid frequently shows the gods hiding themselves from the men whom they favor in clouds. \"Niche,\" in Catholic usage, refers to a shallow architectural recess (e.g., a semicircular space in the wall of a medieval cathedral) designed to hold a statue (e.g., of a saint).\n Gifford suggests that the man’s “garland of grey hair” just before Mulligan’s gesture indicates that he has a tonsure, but the phrase might just as easily describe the ear-level ring of hair that many balding men acquire naturally. In Proteus Stephen recalls the \"garland of grey hair\" as he thinks of thesupposedly bald Joachim of Fiore."

    "expandedNote": " In addition to threatening nonbelievers with the pains of sobriety, Joking Jesus rather fantastically condemns them to drink urine, by a pun that Mulligan has already put into the mouth of Mother Grogan. They will \"have to drink water,\" but since to \"make water\" is to urinate and since Jesus seems to be making all the drinks in the place, the water they drink will be the stuff \"That I make when the wine becomes water again.\" They may \"wish it were plain\"—i.e., Guinness' stout, as in the Irish phrase \"a pint of plain\"—but this water is done with being miraculously converted."

    "note": " The Greek goddesses of Lestrygonians, who sup on ambrosia (\"drinking electricity\") and thus may not need an anus, return in Circe as the ostensibly asexual Nymph who judges Bloom's carnal transgressions: \"We immortals, as you saw today, have not such a place and no hair there either. We are stone cold and pure. We eat electric light.\" The Nymph's words suggest that when Bloom inspected a statue in the National Museum his theory about anal orifices was confirmed and a new thought entered his mind: goddesses have no pubic hair. This may echo one of the celebrated curiosities of Victorian culture, John Ruskin's disastrous aestheticizing of the female midsection.",
    "expandedNote": "England's great 19th century art critic (The Stones of Venice, Modern Painters I-IV, The Seven Lamps of Architecture) had a single very unhappy marriage. On his wedding night in 1848 Ruskin found his wife's body so repulsive that he could not perform as expected. He does not seem to have suffered from latent homosexuality. He anticipated his wedding night with the gusto typical of heterosexual males, writing Effie to say that the thought of seeing her naked prompted unspeakable urges: \"That little undress bit! Ah—my sweet Lady—What naughty thoughts had I …\" Something about Effie's actual body, though, strangled his visual fancies in their crib. During annulment proceedings six years later he said, \"It may be thought strange that I could abstain from a woman who to most people was so attractive. But though her face was beautiful, her person was not formed to excite passion. On the contrary, there were certain circumstances in her person which completely checked it.\" \n The precise \"circumstances\" that chilled Ruskin's ardor may never be known, but clearly they had to do with how Effie's \"person,\" i.e. her body, was \"formed.\" She wrote to her father that John had pled \"various reasons\" for not wanting to have sex with her, but that he \"finally this last year told me his true reason,\" that \"he had imagined women were quite different to what he saw I was, and that the reason he did not make me his Wife was because he was disgusted with my person the first evening 10th April.\" What unimagined feature of women's bodies did Ruskin behold for the first time that night? Starting with Mary Lutyens, an early Ruskin biographer, most people have assumed it was pubic hair, though alternative explanations have been advanced. (Menstruation is only barely plausible: most young men know that women bleed. Disfiguring skin disease seems still less likely: that affliction would not be common to all \"women.\" Unattractive odor could explain such a strong reaction, but it does not square with Effie's mention of \"what he saw.\")\n The usual view, that Ruskin thought women have no hair between their legs, can cite for a cause the fact that he was accustomed to gazing on classical statues. (In addition to the originals he no doubt viewed in Italian and French museums, countless Victorian rooms were decorated with cheap reproductions.) The syllogistic chain of ideas thus attributed to Ruskin—classical statues depict ideal female beauty; those statues have no pubic hair; ergo, beautiful women lack pubic hair—accounts well for Bloom's thoughts. But if Bloom wishes to transcend the messiness of genital hair he has not let it stop him as it stopped Ruskin. And he ultimately rejects the idealizing impulse in Circe, attacking the supposedly suprasexual Nymph as merely presexual: \"If there were only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices? Shy but willing like an ass pissing.\" The stage directions too attack her impersonation of purity: \"Sacrilege! To attempt my virtue! (A large moist stain appears on her robe.) Sully my innocence! You are not fit to touch the garment of a pure woman.\"\n The aestheticizing impulse that reputedly infected the fantasies of one famous Victorian has been hilariously reproduced in another Irish novel, this one set in Ruskin's era. In J. G. Farrell's The Siege of Krishnapur (1973), which is about the Sepoy Rebellion of 1857, two inexperienced young men, Harry and Fleury, are intrigued with a young woman named Lucy whose honor has been compromised. Chapter 16 directs the reader's attention away from any sexual acts that Lucy may have committed to the worst offense that another young woman, Louise, can imagine. Louise supposes that Lucy \"allowed, perhaps even encouraged, certain things to be done to her by a man; she had perhaps allowed her clothes to be fumbled with and disarranged . . . she might even perhaps, for all Louise knew, have been seen naked by him.\" It distresses Louise \"That a man (let us not call him a gentleman) should have been permitted to view that sacred collection of bulges, gaps, tufts of hair and rounded fleshy slopes.\" Exposing this \"delightfully shaped body\" to the gaze of males represents \"a betrayal of her sex.\"\n The erotic charge that characterizes Louise's imagination of the male gaze certainly attaches to Harry and Fleury, but it becomes clear that their visual images do not include \"tufts of hair.\" In chapter 22, the young men experience a version of Ruskin's wedding night when a black cloud of beetles called cockchafers invades a room where Lucy is entertaining visitors at tea, landing on everyone in the room but especially Lucy. She leaps to her feet and furiously beats at the insects, which cling to her everywhere and crawl into every available opening. In a frenzy she pulls off all of her clothes, but still more insects land on her, falling off in clumps as their weight accumulates. Harry and Fleury, shocked at \"the unfortunate turn the tea party had taken,\" watch as \"an effervescent mass detached itself from one of her breasts, which was revealed to be the shape of a plump carp, then from one of her diamond knee-caps, then an ebony avalanche thundered from her spine down over her buttocks, then from some other part of her.\" The brief exposures give the young men \"a faint, flickering image of Lucy's delightful nakedness,\" and the erotic spectacle is distinctly aesthetic: watching it, Fleury dreams up the idea of \"a series of daguerrotypes which would give the impression of movement.\"\n Lucy becomes paralyzed with fear. The men hesitate to touch her, but when she faints they decide to act. Tearing the boards off a Bible to use as blades, they scrape the black crawling mass from her backside and then begin on her front. As they expose swaths of white flesh, they discover that Lucy's body is \"remarkably like the statues of young women they had seen . . . like, for instance, the Collector's plaster cast of Andromeda Exposed to the Monster, though, of course, without any chains. Indeed, Fleury felt quite like a sculptor as he worked away and he thought that it must feel something like this to carve an object of beauty out of the primeval rock. He became quite carried away as with dexterous strokes he carved a particularly exquisite right breast and set to work on the delicate fluting of the ribs.\"\n But it turns out that statues have not prepared the young men for what they will find between Lucy's legs. She has hair there, and \"this caused them a bit of surprise at first. It was not something that had ever occurred to them as possible, likely, or even desirable.\" Having scraped at it to no effect, Harry asks, \"D'you think this is supposed to be here?\" Fleury, who \"had never seen anything like it on a statue,\" says, \"That's odd. . . . Better leave it, anyway, for the time being. We can always come back to it later when we've done the rest.\""

  "090010nothoughts": {
    "note": " In the novel's most unrelentingly cerebral chapter, Stephen often steps back from his feverishly inventive thoughts to mock or undermine them, or to seek relief from their tyrannical grip on his brain. Some of these passages require no explication, but the allusive riddling of others invites comment. Collectively, all of them represent an implicit commentary on the \"theory\" that Stephen is defending.",
    "expandedNote": "Both of Joyce's schemas associate Scylla and Charybdis with the \"brain,\" and by the end of the chapter Stephen's noggin must be aching. In order to defend his view that Shakespeare's sexual life not only informs his works but represents an archetypal pattern for all literary creation, he calls up supporting evidence from two dozen of the Bard's plays, both of his long narrative poems, several turn-of-the-century biographies, and a smattering of Elizabethan and Jacobean cultural history. As his listeners throw challenges at him, he responds to each one. At one point John Eglinton dares him to \"Prove that he was a jew\"—a contention that he has not even made about Shakespeare and which his views in no way require—and he takes up the challenge, weaving a wildly analogical argument about financial avarice, incest, Jewish intermarriage, and cuckold-consciousness. A bit later, longing for the mental gymnastics to end, he thinks, in the idiom of Richard III, \"My kingdom for a drink.\" \n Early on, Stephen sounds despairing: \"Folly. Persist.\" A bit later, he sounds more confident: \"I think you're getting on very nicely. Just mix up a mixture of theolologicophilolological. Mingo, minxi, mictum, mingere.\" But the Latin verb mingodoes not mean \"mix.\" It means to make water, or urinate. All his logical cleverness, sustained by fancy theology and philology, is just pissing in the wind. The faux-Latinate scholarly gloss lends a highly sardonic tinge to \"I think you're getting on very nicely.\" If his audience seems unconvinced, Stephen does too: \"What the hell are you driving at?\"\n And why is he doing it? He has nothing to gain financially or, it would seem, in social esteem. But a strong sense of purpose does sustain him, pushing against the friction of his self-doubt: \"I know. Shut up. Blast you. I have reasons. / Amplius. Adhuc. Iterum. Postea. / Are you condemned to do this?\" (Stephen's love of Scholastic philosophy here prompts more Latinate self-mockery: \"Furthermore. Thus far. Again. Afterwards.\") He may not know exactly where he is going, but he knows that he must see it through to the end: \"Speech, speech. But act. Act speech. They mock to try you. Act. Be acted on. / . . . On.\" \n At a crucial point, Stephen is quick to confess to a charge that his scholarship is bunkum:\n — You are a delusion, said roundly John Eglinton to Stephen. You have brought us all this way to show us a French triangle. Do you believe your own theory? \n — No, Stephen said promptly.\n Seconds later, however, his internal monologue shows him clinging to some core faith in the arguments he is making: \"I believe, O Lord, help my unbelief. That is, help me to believe or help me to unbelieve? Who helps to believe? Egomen. Who to unbelieve? Other chap.\" He quotes from Mark 9:23-24, where a desperate father brings his sick child to Jesus for healing. Jesus says that \"all things are possible to him that believeth\" and the man cries out, \"Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.\" The allusion suggests that Stephen has some underlying faith in what he is doing, even if the point of it is not yet quite clear. \n Belief comes from himself—ego men, Greek for \"I especially\"—but Gifford suggests an allusion also to The Egoist, Dora Marsden's daring literary magazine that published parts of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man beginning in 1914, giving Joyce some reason to hope that he could succeed as a novelist. Unbelief comes from the \"Other chap,\" the not-I against which every artistic sensibility must set itself and also, Gifford suggests, another publisher, George Roberts of Maunsel & Co., who, fearing prosecution, endlessly deferred his promise to publish Dubliners, starting in 1909 and ending only in 1912 with a firm rejection. If Gifford is right, then by layering these later sources of despair and encouragement atop the bardology, Joyce is suggesting that Stephen struggles to maintain faith in his \"theory\" because it is important to his own dream of becoming an artist. \n There is something important at stake for Stephen, but it is not a desire to write pseudo-biographical literary criticism. He makes his arguments about Shakespeare to map an audacious aesthetic account of the dynamics of literary creation. The shamelessly tendentious particulars seem to be as burdensome to him as they are tiresome to his listeners. In one moment of charming candor he acknowledges his tendency to monomanical overgeneralization: \"It is in infinite variety everywhere in the world he has created, in Much Ado about Nothing, twice in As you like It, in The Tempest, in Hamlet, in Measure for Measure, and in all the other plays which I have not read.\" Immediately after this, the narrative adds its own charming observation: \"He laughed to free his mind from his mind's bondage.\"\n This sentence needs no explanation, but it may at least be admired. Laughter does briefly free the mind from obsessive thoughts. So may the drinking that Stephen longs to return to after leaving the library. And so too may something as simple as strong sunlight, which can render a body sentient but blissfully blank. In another line that is no less brilliant for its uncomplicated take on a common human experience, Joyce writes that Stephen steps out of his dark nook in the library into \"a shattering daylight of no thoughts.\""

  "030119nonetome": {
    "note": " In the words that Stephen mouths as he imagines wandering Dublin in the 14th century, \"I spoke to no-one: none to me,\" some commentators have heard echoes of an 18th century English folk song, The Miller of Dee. Each verse of this good-natured song, sung by a miller who is happy to live alone, concludes with the refrain, \"I care for nobody, no, not I, / If nobody cares for me.\" The song accords with Stephen's resolution in the previous paragraph, \"You will not be master of others or their slave,\" and to what he thinks in the following paragraph: \"I want his life still to be his, mine to be mine.\"",
    "expandedNote": " The song hails from the vicinity of Chester on the River Dee, in NW England near the Welsh border. It first appeared in print in Isaac Bickerstaffe's play, Love in a Village (1762), but unwritten folk versions had been sung long before that. There are many variants of the lyrics. Here are the ones sung by The City Waites in the accompanying recording:\n There was a jolly miller once\n Lived on the River Dee;\n He work'd and sang from morn till night,\n No lark more blithe than he.\n And this the burden of his song\n Forever used to be;\n I care for nobody, no, not I,\n If nobody cares for me.\n The reason why he was so blithe,\n He once did thus unfold;\n The bread I eat my hands have earn'd;\n I covet no man's gold;\n I do not fear next quarter-day;\n In debt to none I be.\n I care for nobody, no, not I,\n If nobody cares for me.\n A coin or two I've in my purse,\n To help a needy friend;\n A little I can give the poor,\n And still have some to spend.\n Though I may fail, yet I rejoice,\n Another's good hap to see.\n I care for nobody, no, not I,\n If nobody cares for me.\n So let us his example take,\n And be from malice free;\n Let every one his neighbour serve,\n As served he'd like to be.\n And merrily push the can about\n And drink and sing with glee;\n If nobody cares a doit for us,\n Why not a doit care we.\n The resemblance between the song's refrain and Stephen's sentence is admittedly approximate, but if Stephen is hearing the refrain as he walks on the beach, it suggests that he feels relatively comfortable in his alienated state, as someone who wishes others well but does not want to be entangled in their lives."

Et vidit Deus. Et erant valde bona.\" Egan taking a snooze on Sunday recalls the Judeo-Christian God resting after his labors. Stephen then thinks of \"Pan's hour, the faunal noon.\" The Greek fertility god Pan too was said to rest at noon, and the French poet Stéphane Mallarmé composed afamous work about a faun who awoke from an erotic dream in the \"après-midi,\" after-noon."

Wonder if I'll meet him today.\" The Norwegian captain, who perhaps pops into Bloom's mind because he has just been thinking about merchant shipping between Palestine and Ireland, is a hunchbacked figure in a story told by Joyce's father. This familial inheritance makes only an obscure and inconsequential contribution to Ulysses, but in Finnegans Wake it inspires a twenty-page narrative.",
    "expandedNote": " Ellmann relates that the story came into the Joyce family through Philip McCann, a distant relative who served as James' godfather. McCann told John Joyce \"of a hunchbacked Norwegian captain who ordered a suit from a Dublin tailor, J. H. Kerse of Upper Sackville Street. The finished suit did not fit him, and the captain berated the tailor for being unable to sew, whereupon the irate tailor denounced him for being impossible to fit. The subject was not promising, but it became, by the time John Joyce had retold it, wonderful farce, and it is one of the parables of native and outlander, humorous but full of acrid repartee, which found their way into Finnegans Wake. If that book ever reached his father in the afterworld, James Joyce once said, John Joyce's comment would be, 'Well, he can't tell that story as I used to and that's one sure five!'\" (23-24).\n In the third chapter of Book II of Finnegans Wake (p. 309 ff.), a story about a Norwegian captain and a tailor comes over the radio as HCE is working in his pub. The captain in this story is clearly one of many stand-ins for HCE himself, as a Germanic invader who becomes domesticated through marriage (\"Cawcaught. Coocaged.\"). He bears the name Pukkelson, from pukkel, a Danish word for hump or bump (Humphrey is now a Humpback). The tailor receives the name Kersse, more or less the same as the tailor in the original story, and he is a curser.

Ordinary compound words like \"stairhead,\" \"dressinggown,\" \"gunrest,\" and \"handkerchief\" may not call much attention to themselves, but the novel soon introduces more startling examples, such as Mulligan's request, \"Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor.” That coinage generates others in the next few paragraphs: “snotgreen” (cruder still), “oakpale” (lyrical), “snotgreen” (again), and “scrotumtightening” (la pièce de résistance).",
    "expandedNote": " This part of Telemachus also displays another feature of Joycean language that shaped A Portrait and continues throughout Ulysses: a tendency to repeat words or phrases in such a way as to induce meditation and accumulate resonance. The snotgreen sea soon becomes linked with the green bile that Stephen’s mother vomited into a bowl, and Stephen’s mother comes into the conversation because Mulligan calls the sea “our great sweet mother,” “Our mighty mother!” The green sea becomes “a bowl of bitter waters” like the one beside the bed. And the waters are bitter not only because they remind Stephen of his mother’s suffering but also because a Yeats song which he sang for her mentions “love’s bitter mystery.” Stephen's fear of drowning in the sea becomes linked with his fear of being swallowed up in guilt over the mother whom he loves and fears. Words generate more words in Ulysses, and the reader will soon discover that this can happen not only in adjoining paragraphs but also across vast distances. \n In these several paragraphs, which are not at all unusual inUlysses, one encounters something like a prose poem in which words clump together, separate, generate new words, associate in new ways. The image at right identifies interpenetrating clusters of sound and sense: \n nose, snot, mouth, taste, eating, vomiting, bile\n sea, water, liquid, bowl, bay\n the color green\n razor, blade, killing, death\n mothers\n This prose poem (constructed, admittedly, by the note-writer's decision to excerpt several paragraphs of Joyce's narrative) begins with attention to the word “noserag,” and ends in the same way. It could have started earlier, beginning perhaps with the bowl in which Mulligan has stirred his lather, or Stephen’s fear of drowning in the sea. \n JH 2011"

  "030148notherdying": {
    "note": " In Proteus Stephen recalls how his stay in Paris was interrupted by the arrival of \"a blue French telegram, curiosity to show: / — Nother dying come home father.\" All editions of Ulysses before 1984 have \"Mother,\" but Hans Walter Gabler's \"synoptic\" edition of that year restores the word that Joyce wrote in the so-called Rosenbach manuscript. An error in a telegram that turned his mother into just \"another\" person dying, or perhaps into \"no mother,\" would indeed make it something to show.",
    "expandedNote": " \"Nother\" is one of many changes in the Gabler text applauded by Joyce biographer Richard Ellmann. When he reviewed the new edition in the 15 June 1986 issue of the New York Times, Ellmann wrote, \"It appears that the famous telegram from Simon Dedalus to Stephen did not read when delivered to him in Paris, 'Mother dying come home father,' but 'Nother dying come home father.' Hence it was, as Stephen recalls, a 'curiosity to show.' The typesetters could not believe their eyes in this instance, nor in another when the black horn fan held by the 'whoremistress' Bella Cohen asks, 'Have you forgotten me?' and is answered, 'Nes. Yo.' They changed it to 'Yes. No.\"'\n Although Ellmann's biography asserts that on 10 April 1903 Joyce received a telegram at his Parisian hotel reading \"MOTHER DYING COME HOME FATHER\" (128), and others have referred to it as an actual occurrence, there seems to be no hard evidence that such a telegram (with either spelling) was ever sent. Gabler bases his reading on the manuscript and the successive proofs for the first edition preserved at the Harry Ransom Center in Austin, Texas. In a personal communication, he observes, “I am not aware that, outside the fiction of Ulysses, there is material evidence that James Joyce during his sojurn in Paris received such a telegram. Richard Ellmann may nonetheless not be far off the mark when he at this point reconstructs James Joyce’s biography from the fiction James Joyce wrote about Stephen Dedalus—but what he, Ellmann, says is an extrapolation from the fiction.” \n Real or imagined, it is no wonder that Joyce, so attentive to the quirks of language, would refer to the telegram as a \"curiosity.\" The word calls to mind Curiosities of Literature, by Isaac D’Israeli (1766-1848, father of the British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli), a multi-volume and very popular work that highlights the eccentric contents and backstories of supposedly serious books of the later 18th and earlier 19th centuries. It may be another of Stephen Dedalus’s self-deprecating moments in Proteus that he sees himself ending up as an anecdote in a D’Israeli-like collection, remembered for all the wrong reasons. Truth being stranger than fiction, Joyce does appear in a modern-day Curiosities of Literature by John Sutherland (Penguin, 2009).\n Critics have pointed out the irony of Joyce deliberately inserting typos into a work that is infamous for its manuscript corruptions. John Noel Turner, in \"Miles of Porches of Ears,\" JJQ 36 (1999): 979-84, notes that the mistakes of typesetters and others have tended to blur Joyce’s “intentional obscurities.” Details like Bloom's \"high grade ha\" must be meant to spark reflection about the production and reproduction of words. Beyond what Joyce may be saying about language, he clearly embraced the comic potential of errors. In Lotus Eaters Bloom too receives a letter with a misspelling (\"that other world\"), and in Eumaeus he finds that the Evening Telegraph has spelled his name \"L. Boom.”"

    "note": " During Bloom's brief absence from the pub in Lestrygonians, Nosey Flynn says \"there's one thing he'll never do,\" and he mimes the action by pretending to write his signature on the table beside him. Davy Byrne says, \"I know.\" \"Nothing in black and white,\" Flynn affirms. This attribution sounds suspiciously like an anti-Semitic slur casting Jews as financially cunning, but Flynn has just been talking at length about Freemasonry, and there is more evidence to suggest that he is thinking of that order's obsession with secrecy—in particular, a Masonic oath that Bloom recalls in Circe.",
    "expandedNote": " Gifford notes an \"assumption that all Jews were averse to swearing an oath on signing a contract\" (presumably because such oaths would have drawn on Christian religious language), and Sam Slote echoes him, remarking that Bloom's refusal to sign his name \"Follows from the (erroneous) superstition that Jews are forbidden from signing legal contracts.\" But Gifford also supposes that Flynn is expressing \"the suspicion of Bloom's secretiveness as a Mason.\" (Thornton and Johnson do not attempt to gloss the passage, and Kiberd rather unhelpfully remarks that it concerns Bloom's reluctance to \"sign a cheque.\")\n In a personal communication, Des Gunning puts his money on the Masonic interpretation, citing an oath sworn by new members of the fraternal order to keep its mysteries secret. Malcolm C. Duncan's Ritual and Monitor of Freemasonry (1866) records a version of this oath, in which the candidate had to \"sincerely promise and swear, that I will always hail, ever conceal, and never reveal, any of the arts, parts, or points of the hidden mysteries of Ancient Free Masonry\" to anyone not known to be a fellow Mason. \"I furthermore promise and swear that I will not print, paint, stamp, stain, cut, carve, mark, or engrave them, or cause the same to be done, on any thing movable or immovable, capable of receiving the least impression of a word, syllable, letter, or character, whereby the same may become legible or intelligible to any person under the canopy of heaven, and the secrets of Masonry thereby unlawfully obtained through my unworthiness.\"\n To be sure, the oath does not obligate one never to sign one's name or commit mundane transactions to writing, but given Flynn's lurid preoccupation with the secrecy of Masons it is entirely reasonable to suppose that he might attribute such reluctance to a man whom he supposes to be a Mason. And much later in the novel it becomes clear that Bloom has in fact taken the oath. At the end of Circe, in language nearly identical to that recorded in Duncan's work, he mumbles his commitment to conceal the sacred mysteries: \"swear that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts, art or arts . . .\"\n For what it's worth, Davy Byrne for one did not subscribe to the doctrine of \"Nothing in black and white.\" Senan Moloney reports that on a wall of his pub, next to the women's restroom, hangs a postcard which he apparently mailed back home in September 1912 telling his employees and friends that he was having a good time in America, had \"Enjoyed the parade,\" and hoped that they all were well. He signed it \"DB.\""

    "note": " As Bloom returns to his house after his shopping trip, he looks at the \"Blotchy brown brick houses\" on the other side of Eccles Street: \"Number eighty still unlet. Why is that? Valuation is only twenty-eight. Towers, Battersby, North, MacArthur: parlour windows plastered with bills. Plasters on a sore eye.\" Joyce here transferred what he knew about number 7 to number 88, preserving an impression of the problems plaguing Dublin real estate.",
    "expandedNote": " In 1904, Gifford notes, the house at 7 Eccles Street \"was valued at £28 and was vacant.\" Number 80, by contrast, was valued at £17 and was occupied. So, having moved the fictional Blooms into number 7, Joyce fictively assigned its vacancy and its valuation to a house across the street. And to the parlor windows of that house he attached signs from four different Dublin realtors, advertising its availability and blighting its appearance. \n Dublin real estate in 1904 was a disaster. Conditions in the countryside during the 19th century, not least the famines of the 1840s, had impelled thousands of peasants to relocate to the city, turning formerly elegant Georgian brick townhouses into miserably crowded slum dwellings. Many rich and middle-class Dubliners responded by moving to nearby towns that were becoming suburbs of the metropolis, leaving behind them an even more blasted cityscape. On the pages of Thom's, middle-class residents are listed at some addresses, while many others are \"Vacant,\" or \"Tenements\" housing uncounted and unnamed impoverished families, or \"Ruins.\" Even a moderately prosperous street like the Blooms' would have had many a missing tooth or \"sore eye.\""
  },
  "040075seventyfive": {
    "note": " Far away from Dublin and relying on Thom's, Joyce appears to have gotten one detail of the cityscape very slightly wrong in Calypso. The narrative says of Bloom, \"He crossed to the bright side, avoiding the loose cellarflap of number seventyfive.\" His house sits across from number 77.",
    "expandedNote": " Bloom's house sits on the northeast side of Eccles Street, facing away from the morning sun, so he crosses to the warm and cheerful side of the street. There he turns left, to get to Dorset Street. In James Joyce's Dublin, Ian Gunn and Clive Hart write, \"As on one or two other occasions, Joyce overreached himself in usingThom's to supply the meticulous factual background which would give the reader such an uncanny sense of close observation and of remarkable powers of recall. The houses opposite no. 7 Eccles Street are nos 76 and 77. To reach no. 75 Bloom would have had to veer slightly to his right, away from his intended path\" (32-33).\n \"It is of course possible,\" Gunn and Hart concede, \"that what appears to be a mistake is a halfhidden indication that Bloom begins by walking in the other direction and then changes his mind. If so, that provides an interesting adumbration of the end of Lestrygonians, when Bloom, about to cross sunny Kildare Street on his way to the Library, veers to the right to avoid Boylan. It is perhaps more probable, however, that this is an error arising from Joyce's having used the street list in Thom's to count seven houses back on the 'bright' side, beginning with the last, no. 81, and thus arriving at 75. In physical fact the corner of Eccles Street and Dorset Street, on that side of the road, is occupied not by the last house in Eccles Street but by 72-73 Upper Dorset Street (Larry O'Rourke's pub), while on Bloom's side no. 1 Eccles Street is on the corner. This matter, of minimal importance in itself, is an example of how Joyce's working methods could occasionally lead him astray\" (33)."

  "030044danoccam": {
    "note": " Having imagined the simultaneous ringing of different sacring bells as a figure for the transcendent Body of Christ that is simultaneously present in different eucharistic Hosts, Stephen thinks of the medieval theologian who argued logically for the same insight that he has just conceived metaphorically: \"Dan Occam thought of that, invincible doctor. A misty English morning the imp hypostasis tickled his brain.\"",
    "expandedNote": " William of Occam (or Ockham) was an English-born Franciscan friar and scholastic philosopher who figured prominently in the theological disputes of the 14th century. Among other honorific titles, he was called Doctor Invincibilis, the Invincible Teacher. \"Dan,\" Thornton notes, is an old title meaning simply \"Mr.\" or \"Sir.\" Occam is best known for advocating nominalism (the view that universal essences like Platonic Forms have no real existence but are mere abstractions from particular things) and for \"Occam's razor\" (his principle that the satisfactory explanation of a phenomenon which relies on the fewest postulates should be preferred over more complicated explanations that postulate unnecessary causes or conditions). In both these positions, and more generally in his hostility to the unnecessary \"multiplication\" of rational categories (he relied on faith to explain what reason could not), he has been a kind of patron saint for the skeptical empiricism that characterizes much later English philosophy. \n Gifford notes that in the Tractatus de Sacramento Altaris Occam argues that \"after the host is consecrated, its quantity and quality are unchanged; therefore, the body of Christ is not in the host in quantity or quality (i.e., the host is not the body of Christ by \"reason,\" but by \"faith\"), so there is only one body of Christ and not several.\" This relates closely to the insight that Stephen has fancied in terms of two bells that \"twang in dipthong.\" \n In theology, the term \"hypostasis\" (literally a standing under) can refer to Christ's simultaneous possession of two natures, divine and human. Thornton observes that it is \"misleading\" to apply this term to the problem of \"multilocation\" that Occam addressed (how the Eucharist could be present in more than one Host at once)."

    "note": " Dublin's grandest avenue, \"O'Connell Street,\" runs north from the River Liffey for 500 meters. It is often said to be the widest city street in Europe, and has been described as a more intimate version of Paris' majestic Champs Élysées. A monument to Daniel O'Connell stands at the southern foot of the street, and today a statue to Charles Stewart Parnell marks the north end, though at the time represented in the novel only a foundation stone had been laid. Other statues of historically important figures line the route between these two termini. South of the river and bending west, other streets continue the grand central thoroughfare of Dublin.",
    "expandedNote": " In 1904 the avenue was officially called Sackville Street, a name assigned in the late 1700s when it began to be widened and built up. Sackville Street orginally ran from the Rotunda Hospital to the place where the Nelson Pillar was erected in 1808. Soon afterward it was extended to the river as part of a grand thoroughfare leading to the centers of government power, with the section north of the pillar called Upper Sackville Street and the southern section called Lower. But Joyce's novel only uses the name of the Duke of Dorset once, when Bloom thinks in Ithaca of buying lily-of-the-valley bulbs from a seed and bulb business at \"23 Sackville street, upper.\" Although the name O'Connell Street did not become official until 1924, after Irish independence, the language of Ulysses suggests that this process was far advanced by 1904. Passages in Lotus Eaters, Aeolus,Wandering Rocks, and Ithaca use the new name, not Sackville.\n The monument to O'Connell, designed by the accomplished Irish sculptor John Henry Foley, had much to do with this change. Unveiled in 1882, it features a 13-foot bronze statue of the great leader atop a granite plinth that has four winged Victories at its lower corners, and many other figures above, including a personified Ireland trampling on her broken chains and pointing upward to the man who broke them. The erection of the monument moved many Dubliners to give a new name to the street, and members of the Dublin Corporation tried to make the change official in the 1880s. Other residents objected, however, and the Corporation did not obtain legal authority to make the change until 1890. Faced with continuing opposition, it decided to give the new name time to become popular with the citizenry. \n After passing the Sir Philip Crampton memorial and the William Smith O'Brien statue on the south side of the river, the funeral procession in Hades crosses the O'Connell Bridge and begins its journey up O'Connell Street by passing \"under the hugecloaked Liberator's form.\" O'Connell was known as the Liberator or Emancipator for his herculean efforts to enfranchise Ireland's Catholics and return the Irish Parliament to Dublin. As the cortège passes up the boulevard, the narrative calls attention to some of its prominent features, including statues erected in memory of Sir John Gray, Lord Nelson, and Father Thomas Mathew.\n Ever since the founding of Sackville Street, there has been a pronounced dissimilarity between the part of the street nearer the river and the more northerly half. O'Connell Street Lower has always thrived as a commercial magnet, but the Upper section was too far away from the city center to attract many upscale businesses. As Bloom rolls along the upper section of the street in Hades, approaching the Rotunda, he thinks, \"Dead side of the street this. Dull business by day, land agents, temperance hotel, Falconer's railway guide, civil service college, Gill's, catholic club, the industrious blind. Why? Some reason. Sun or wind. At night too. Chummies and slaveys.\"\n Proceeding south across O'Connell Bridge to the other side of the river, the grand urban way continues along Westmoreland Street, passes the former Irish Parliament building on College Green, and moves west along Dame Street before arriving at Dublin's two centers of civic and imperial power: City Hall and Dublin Castle."

    "note": " In Circe Bloom thinks of Georgina Simpson's housewarming party, sixteen years earlier, on \"Old Christmas night.\" This is another name for January 6, more commonly called Twelfth Night or the Epiphany. The expression endures in parts of England, Ireland, the maritime provinces of Canada, and Appalachian America.",
    "expandedNote": " Although there is an older history from the reign of Constantine in the 4th century, the modern duel between December 25 and January 6 dates from 1582, when Pope Gregory XIII instituted a new calendar to correct the ongoing drift between a 365-day calendar and a slightly longer astronomical year. The non-integral mismatch between earthly days and earthly years meant that, with each passing calendrical year, dates diverged a little further from the equinoxes. The Gregorian solution initiated our practice of \"leap years,\" whereby one day is added to the calendar every four years. (The reality is in fact slightly more complicated. Since the earth takes 365.2422 days to orbit the sun, rather than 365.25, leap years are defined as years divisible by 4, not including most years divisible by 100, but including years divisible by 400.) \n Some Catholic countries adopted the new calendar immediately, but other countries came on board decades or centuries later, having drifted yet further from their appropriate solar positions. In Britain, legislation called the Calendar Act was passed in 1751, by which time the drift was approximately twelve days, so twelve days were dropped from the old Julian calendar. The result was that in 1752 Christmas was celebrated on December 25, but purists clung to the old date of January 6. For readers interested in what Ithaca calls the \"parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars, in reality evermoving wanderers,\" the inexactitude of human calendars provides an additional, temporal way to contemplate the concept of parallax."

    "note": " In response to Egan's fondness for The Boys of Kilkenny, either Stephen (silently) or Egan himself (energetically) summons up the city mentioned in the song: \"Old Kilkenny: saint Canice, Strongbow's castle on the Nore.\" The thoughts are of Kilkenny's history.",
    "expandedNote": " The town of Kilkenny, in the county of the same name, lies about 100 km (60 miles) southwest of Dublin, on the way to Waterford. The town grew up on both sides of the River Nore, long after a monastery, and later a baronial castle and a cathedral, were founded on one of the river's banks—hence the reference to \"Old Kilkenny.\" \n \"S. Canice\" (Cainnech moccu Dalánn), mentioned also in Cyclops, was an Irish monk (ca. 515-600) who helped spread Christianity through Ireland and the western isles of Scotland. The name Kilkenny came from a church founded in the 13th century in his name (Kil = church, Kenny = Cainnech), on the site of a monastery founded earlier by Canice. A round tower (visible in the photograph at right) remains from the church's 6th century monastic origins. The cathedral now belongs to the (Protestant) Church of Ireland. \n In the previous century, the Anglo-Norman adventurer known as \"Strongbow\" came to this area looking to establish a base for his claim to be King of Leinster. Arc-Fort, a.k.a. Strongbow, a.k.a. Richard de Clare, the second Earl of Pembroke, had come to Ireland from Wales as a leader of the invasion that began in 1169 with the landing of an expeditionary force in County Wexford. When the Irish High King deposed Dermot MacMurrough (Diarmait Mac Murchada) as King of Leinster in 1167, MacMurrough appealed to King Henry II in England to restore his rule, in return for an oath of allegiance to Henry. After the invasion began he agreed to marry his daughter Aoife to Strongbow, and to pass on the rule of Leinster to his son-in-law at his death. MacMurrough died in 1171, opening the door for Strongbow to assert his claim—a development which so greatly alarmed Henry that he mounted his own invasion in that year to check the power of his vassal. To consolidate his power in Leinster, Strongbow built a castle above a strategic ford of the Nore in 1172, not far from Canice's monastery. The original structure may have been wooden, but Strongbow's descendants soon replaced it with a Norman stone castle, which is no doubt the one mentioned in the novel."

Most likely it refers simply to employees cleaning the taproom equipment, but some have inferred that they are swilling the beer left over in customers' glasses, or collecting it and selling it to new customers.",
    "expandedNote": " Gifford glosses \"old man\" as referring to the remainder in a drinker's glass. He suggests (I think) that \"instead of throwing it out,\" the servers may be carrying these leftover portions down to the privacy of the \"cellar\" and finishing them off. Richard Wall's Anglo-Irish Dialect Glossary for Joyce's Works says that the phrase refers to \"beer slops which are sold to unsuspecting customers.\" Again, the subterfuge would presumably be performed in the cellar.\n But such suspicious inferences are probably unnecessary. Slote instead quotes from an entry in Partridge's Dictionary of Slang that defines \"old man\" as \"That part of the beer engine in which the surplus beer collects.\" I do not know what happens to the beer that goes through the slotted grid under the taps, but perhaps Bloom does. If it collects in a receptacle in the cellar, then he is simply imagining, sympathetically, the pub workers' unpleasant task of cleaning out stale slops at the end of the day."

  "060015riordan": {
    "note": " A blaringly outspoken figure from the early pages of A Portrait of the Artist returns in Ulysses, much muted, as both Bloom and Molly think back to the last days of \"old Mrs Riordan.\" In Ithaca Stephen and Bloom discover that they both knew Dante Riordan: she served as a governess in the Dedalus household and later lived in the same hotel as the Blooms. Molly's dislike of the woman puts a kind of coda to the story of this bitterly pious old zealot, whose real-life model John Joyce's biographers have called \"fat and formidable\" (128).",
    "expandedNote": " Joyce modeled Mrs. Riordan on a Cork woman named Mrs. Elizabeth Conway who may have been a distant relative of John Joyce and who was governess to his children from 1888 through the end of 1891. Devoutly religious, Elizabeth Hearn entered a convent but left before taking her final vows when her brother died in 1862, leaving her a large inheritance of £30,000. She married Patrick Conway in 1875, but after living with her for two years he left Ireland for Buenos Aires with most of her money and did not return. The experience seems to have permanently embittered Elizabeth.\n In My Brother's Keeper, the anti-Christian Stanislaus Joyce devotes several pages to a richly detailed portrait of Mrs. Conway. He calls her the \"first educator\" of his brother James, who began the family tradition of calling her \"Dante,\" \"probably a childish mispronunciation of Auntie.\" Among other subjects, she taught James \"a good deal of very bigoted Catholicism and bitterly anti-English patriotism.\" Stanislaus recalls that Mrs. Conway \"was unlovely and very stout,\" dressed primly, loved to have the children bring her \"the tissue paper that came wrapped round parcels,\" and regularly complained of back pains \"which I used to imitate pretty accurately for the amusement of the nursery.\" \"She had her bursts of energy, however\": when an elderly man stood up, hat in hand, at a band's playing of God Save the Queen, she gave him \"a rap on the noddle with her parasol\" (7-11).\n For Stanislaus, the intelligence and occasional tenderness of the governess were far outweighed by her fondness for original sin, divine judgment, and eternal damnation. \"Whatever the cause,\" he writes, \"she was the most bigoted person I ever had the misadventure to encounter\" (9). The \"cause\" must have had much to do with her unhappy marriage, for she also possessed an unusual degree of vengeful sexual prudery. Jackson and Costello recount an incident in which she convinced John Joyce's wife to burn his photographs of his former girlfriends while he was out of the house. May tried to take the blame, but John knew at once that the real instigator was \"that old bitch upstairs\" (159).\n The opening section of A Portrait glances at the governess's patriotism and her small kindnesses to young Stephen: \"Dante had two brushes in her press. The brush with the maroon velvet back was for Michael Davitt and the brush with the green velvet back was for Parnell. Dante gave him a cachou every time he brought her a piece of tissue paper.\" (Stephen recalls these details in Ithaca.) It then evokes her vicious religious intolerance. Stephen says that when he grows up he will marry Eileen Vance, the Protestant girl next door, after which he is shown hiding \"under the table\" as his mother says, \"O, Stephen will apologise.\" Dante: \"O, if not, the eagles will come and pull out his eyes.\" Mesmerized, the little boy repeats the refrains \"Apologise\" and \"Pull out his eyes,\" making of them a small rhyming poem.\n The O'Shea divorce scandal ended Mrs. Riordan's love of Charles Stewart Parnell, as it did for many puritanical Irish Catholics. Joyce evoked this watershed in the most powerfully emotional scene in his fiction, Mrs. Riordan's ferocious argument with Mr. Dedalus and Mr. Casey at the Christmas dinner of 1891, several months after Parnell's death. Young Stephen watches the religious and patriotic halves of his education collide as the two men abominate the Catholic bishops for betraying Parnell and the governess spits hatred back at them. \n The boy understands that Mr. Casey \"was for Ireland and Parnell and so was his father: and so was Dante too for one night at the band on the esplanade she had hit a gentleman on the head with her umbrella because he had taken off his hat when the band played God save the Queen at the end.\" But the church's hatred of sexual immorality has trumped allegiance to the great parliamentary leader. At the climax of the argument, fulfilling the promise of her sobriquet, Dante bellows, \"God and morality and religion come first. . . . God and religion before everything! . . . God and religion before the world!\" \"Very well then,\" Mr. Casey replies, \"if it comes to that, no God for Ireland! . . . We have had too much God in Ireland. Away with God!\" The governess screams, \"Blasphemer! Devil!...Devil out of hell! We won! We crushed him to death! Fiend!\" \n Ulysses sounds only faint echoes of this vivid personality. Ithaca notes that after leaving the Dedalus household at the end of 1891, and before dying in 1896, Mrs. Riordan lived \"during the years 1892, 1893 and 1894 in the City Arms Hotel owned by Elizabeth O’Dowd of 54 Prussia street where, during parts of the years 1893 and 1894, she had been a constant informant of Bloom who resided also in the same hotel.\" Bloom was kind to the old woman: \"He had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings, an infirm widow of independent, if limited, means, in her convalescent bathchair\" to the North Circular Road, where she would gaze on its traffic through his binoculars. And Hades reveals that when she lay dying in Our Lady's Hospice in the Mater, he visited her there. \n Molly thinks that these \"corporal works of mercy\" manifested an ulterior motive. Like the Dedalus children hoping to receive rewards for bringing tissue papers to the governess, Bloom \"thought he had a great leg of\" the old woman and would inherit something at her death, but \"she never left us a farthing all for masses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever.\" The narrator of Cyclops too remembers this episode: \"Time they were stopping up in the City Arms pisser Burke told me there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and Bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing bézique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw.\" One of the hallucinations in Circe represents this view that Bloom was angling for a bequest. When Father Farley accuses Bloom of being \"an episcopalian, an agnostic, an anythingarian seeking to overthrow our holy faith,\" one adherent of the Catholic faith responds warmly: \"MRS RIORDAN: (Tears up her will.) I’m disappointed in you! You bad man!\" \n But Bloom knows a sadder part of the story that Molly does not: Mrs. Riordan's means were indeed \"limited,\" as Ithaca notes, her wealth \"suppositious.\" When the real Mrs. Conway died in November 1896, her assets totaled only £40 6s. 6d. And, in a supreme irony, administration of the estate was granted to Patrick Conway, her husband, mysteriously recorded as living at Dominick Street, Dublin. \n Molly hated Mrs. Riordan's constant complaints and her prudish piety but she respected her learning, and she thinks that Bloom was not entirely mercenary: \"telling me all her ailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and earthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first God help the world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and lownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them I suppose she was pious because no man would look at her twice I hope Ill never be like her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a welleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about Mr Riordan here and Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her dog smelling my fur and always edging to get up under my petticoats especially then still I like that in him polite to old women like that.\""

Vivien Igoe agrees that Mary Thornton, \"a professional midwife\" living at 19A, delivered Margaret (January 1884), Charles (July 1886), and Eileen (January 1889), but she includes Stanislaus (December 1884) on the list and makes no mention of Florence. \"Mrs. Thornton was popular with all the Joyce family,\" she observes.\n Bloom thinks of Mrs. Thornton as warmly as did the Joyces. InCalypso he remembers her as a \"Jolly old woman,\" and in Lestrygonians he thinks, \"Old Mrs Thornton was a jolly old soul. All my babies, she said. The spoon of pap in her mouth before she fed them. O, that's nyumnyum.\" In Circe she attends him \"In nursetender's gown\" as he gives birth to eight male children: \"Embrace me tight, dear. You'll be soon over it. Tight, dear.\" The midwife's home on Denzille Street probably holds interest of a second kind for Bloom, unrelated to childbirth, and its location near the National Maternity Hospital also deserves comment.\n § In Calypso Bloom thinks of the June morning fifteen years ago when Milly was born, \"running to knock up Mrs Thornton in Denzille Street.\" Denzille, now part of Fenian Street, lies quite near the NMH on the northeast side of Merrion Square but some distance from the Blooms' home. Gifford, apparently wondering about Bloom's stamina as a runner, observes that her address \"would locate her approximately one and a half miles northeast of Bloom's residence in Lombard Street West if the Blooms were living there in 1889.\" His reasoning is questionable on two counts. First, the Blooms were almost certainly living in Pleasants Street, not Lombard (though not very far from it) in 1889. More importantly, if Molly gave birth in the hospital, Bloom probably first accompanied her there and then went to fetch the midwife, in which case his running the short distance from Holles to Denzille would be quite unremarkable—if, in fact, the NMH was open for business in 1899."

    "note": " In Calypso Bloom thinks of \"poor old Professor Goodwin,\" and more recollections follow in Lestrygonians, Sirens, Circe, Ithaca, and Penelope. William Goodwin was an actual Dublin pianist, conductor, composer, and music teacher. Calling him \"old\" seems odd, since he died in 1892 at age 53, but alcoholism may have brought on premature antiquity. The name \"Professor\" is interesting too, given Goodwin's hallucinated performance of a popular song in Circe. Pianists in New Orleans whorehouses were often honored with that title.",
    "expandedNote": "The real Goodwin, according to Vivien Igoe, worked as the organist at St. Peter's Church, a large Catholic church in Phibsborough built in the style of Gothic cathedrals. He also played piano, conducted concerts in various Dublin locations, taught music in several local schools, and composed sacred music. Igoe notes that his Discite a Me \"was composed and arranged with organ accompaniment, and was advertised in the Nation in June 1890. His publications included Goodwin's Hand Book of Singing for the Use of Schools.\" John Stanislaus Joyce, the writer's father, was a friend of Goodwin and sang in at least one of his concerts.\n The Blooms think of Professor Goodwin because he used to accompany Molly when she performed. In their recollections he cuts a pitiful figure. Bloom thinks in Calypso, “Poor old professor Goodwin. Dreadful old case. Still he was a courteous old chap. Oldfashioned way he used to bow Molly off the platform. And the little mirror in his silk hat. The night Milly brought it into the parlour. O, look what I found in professor Goodwin's hat!\" The hat comes back in Lestrygonians, along with Bloom's memories of a windy night \"after Goodwin's concert in the supperroom or oakroom of the Mansion house.\" On that night Bloom and Boylan were walking next to each other on the sidewalk, with \"Professor Goodwin linking her in front. Shaky on his pins, poor old sot. His farewell concerts. Positively last appearance on any stage. May be for months and may be for never.\" When they got home Bloom fried some meat for his wife over the fire and made some \"mulled rum.\" The details are important because they mark this as the same night that Molly recalls in Penelope: \"the night after Goodwins botchup of a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to mull and the fire wasnt black out.\"\n Goodwin's drinking has been interfering with his piano-playing, then, and after this night it prematurely ended his career and life. The men who gather around the piano in Sirens are probably recalling the same farewell concert: “Poor old Goodwin was the pianist that night, Father Cowley reminded them. There was a slight difference of opinion between himself and the Collard grand. There was.” Simon Dedalus affirms the cause: “The devil wouldn't stop him. He was a crotchety old fellow in the primary stage of drink.” Molly scorns the \"Professor\" moniker: \"he was a patent professor of John Jameson.\" Still, she thinks, \"he was a real old gent in his way it was impossible to be more respectful.\"\n In Circe, as the action in the whorehouse approaches its climax Goodwin’s ghost suddenly appears and takes a spectacular turn at the piano: \"Professor Goodwin, in a bowknotted periwig, in court dress, wearing a stained inverness cape, bent in two from incredible age, totters across the room, his hands fluttering. He sits tinily on the pianostool and lifts and beats handless sticks of arms on the keyboard, nodding with damsel's grace, his bowknot bobbing.\" This frantic, ghoulish performance emphasizes the old man's alcoholic debility, but it may also be a response to his sobriquet, since \"professors\" often played popular music on pianos in the bordellos of New Orleans. They included, among many others, the famous Jelly Roll Morton (Ferdinand Joseph LaMothe, nicknamed after a product sold at the brothels where he began playing at the age of 14), Tony Jackson (even more famous locally), and Manuel \"Fess\" Manetta.\n In the years around 1900 the whorehouse reached its institutional zenith in New Orleans. The city's red light district was called Storyville, much to the irritation of Sidney Story, the civic reformer who in 1897 proposed to sequester the vice trade in a single neighborhood to protect the sensibilities and property values of decent citizens. This counterpart to Dublin's Monto (New Orleans also had a flourishing community of roiling, Fenian-supporting Irish expats) featured poorer houses where uptight youths cooling their heels might feed a player piano with coins or turn the crank on a gramophone, as well as decidedly upscale establishments with Victorian music parlors where customers could listen to small string ensembles or to pianists playing grand pianos. \n The Historic New Orleans Collection website confirms that pianists in these expensive brothels were commonly called “professors.\" They \"played for tips against a guarantee put up by the madams. Playing at the most exclusive brothels meant access to an audience with deep pockets. With no band members to pay out, professors were the highest paid of the District’s musicians.\" Many had classical training, and they were essentially practicing musicologists: \"Customers frequently wanted to hear popular tunes from Broadway shows and the Ziegfeld Follies, opera favorites, ragtime hits, and the latest releases from New York’s Tin Pan Alley. Musicians had to be prepared to play anything the customer wanted to hear. Bawdy lyrics sometimes replaced the actual words to the songs and were often sung by the piano player, the madam herself, or the sex workers in her employ.\" Late in the evening, given some heat and lubrication, the tunes often switched to the latest “funky” sounds borrowed from players like Buddy Bolden on the black side of Canal Street. \n Working on Circe in 1920, Joyce may conceivably have heard some New Orleans-style piano music played in a Paris cafe and learned about the whorehouse music scene. It would explain his decision to take a classically trained musician out of the concert hall, move him into a whorehouse \"musicroom,\" and have him bust out with My Girl’s a Yorkshire Girl. Perhaps the Professor plays this popular favorite in an up-tempo stride beat with a ghostly banjo and tuba for accompaniment!"

    "note": " The \"old Troy of the D. M. P.\" mentioned at the beginning of Cyclops was a real person, Denis Troy, who worked for most of his adult life as a constable for the Dublin Metropolitan Police. Since he was born on 10 August 1853, in June 1904 he would have been 50 years old. It is not altogether clear, then, why Joe Hynes should ask, \"Who's the old ballocks you were talking to?,\" or why the chapter's narrator should reply that it was \"Old Troy\" who \"was in the force.\"",
    "expandedNote": " In Real People Vivien Igoe reports that Denis was born to John Troy and his wife Mary, née Hennessy, \"in the Slieve Bloom Mountains between Roscrea and Kinnity in Co. Offaly.\" She may be mistaken about the location, since on the 1901 and 1911 census forms Denis Troy listed his birthplace as Co. Tipperary. The village of Kinnitty is in County Offaly, on the western slopes of the Slieve Bloom, but the market town of Roscrea lies just over the border in County Tipperary, southwest of Kinnitty in a valley farther away from the mountains. \n In 1884, now working in Dublin, Denis married Bridget Murphy, who was born in County Westmeath. According to Igoe he \"was living at 42 Newmarket (off the Coombe) and Bridget was living at 48 Bellview near Ushers Quay. They moved to Arbour Hill after their marriage. Here they raised their family of five children. In 1904 they lived at 14 Arbour Hill and by 1917 had moved to 8 Arbour Hill.\" Ambiguity attends these addresses as well, because at some point in time all the houses on Arbour Hill were renumbered. The digitized records of the 1901 census at census.nationalarchives.ie show the Troys living at number 14, but those of the 1911 census show them living at number 7 rather than number 8. It seems that the house still had the lower number in 1911, but by 1917, the date cited by Igoe, it had been raised by one.\n Troy had joined the DMP at age 27 in December 1880 and \"was stationed,\" Igoe notes, \"at Manor Street, which extends from Stoneybatter to Prussia Street.\" This accounts for the couple's decision to move to Arbour Hill and puts him in the right place, whether in uniform or not, to run into the chapter's narrator on the corner of Stoneybatter and Arbour Hill. The narrator's statement that Troy used to be in the police force is strange, though, because his DMP employment continued until his 67th birthday on 10 August 1920, when he was pensioned. Would he have been moved from street patrols to a desk job (or promoted to Inspector) by age 50, prompting the narrator to surmise that he was no longer \"in the force\"? Or did Joyce somehow confuse his information, attributing to the 1904 policeman an age more appropriate to the writing of Cyclops in 1919? The latter seems more likely.\n In a personal communication, Troy's great-grandson Mike O'Connor reports that the five children of Denis and Bridget were those who remained from ten live births. He has tracked down records of four of the other five: Daniel (born 1892) died at the age of 1½, Patrick (born 1896) lived for only two months, Thomas (born 1899) died at 2½ , and Celia (born 1901) died after one month. Family and census records identify the children who beat these appalling odds—which, incidentally, are the same odds encountered by Leopold and Molly Bloom in their less ambitious production of offspring—as John (born ca. 1888), Francis (born ca. 1890), Gabriel (born ca. 1895), Michael or Augustine (born ca. 1898, with different names listed on the 1901 and the 1911 census), and Mary Kathleen (born 1903). The 1911 census also shows three adult boarders named Teresa, Joseph, and Margret Finnegan living in the Arbour Hill house. On these census reports Denis Troy identifies his family as Roman Catholic.\n Mary Kathleen married Bernard (\"Ben\") O'Connor in 1932 and had four children: Dermot (born 1933), Mike's father Brendan (born 1935), Fergus (born 1941), and Vincent (born 1946, died 1950). Dermot O'Connor appears here in a photograph with his grandfather Denis, now well and truly \"old\" at an age somewhere beyond 85. The photograph was taken at the back of the house at 8 Arbour Hill, probably on the day of Dermot's first communion. Denis died not very long after, in 1943, and was buried in the Mount Jerome cemetery.\n Mike O'Connor has generously shared the three family photos displayed on this page."

  "040018oldtweedy": {
    "note": " Molly Bloom's father, a man named \"Tweedy,\" was an officer in the Royal Dublin Fusiliers stationed in \"Gibraltar\" during her infancy and youth. In Ithaca he is called \"Major Brian Cooper Tweedy.\" According to Ellmann, Joyce based Tweedy on a Dubliner who called himself Major Powell but who in fact served only as a sergeant-major, an important non-commissioned or warrant officer. This ambiguity attaches to Tweedy in the novel.",
    "expandedNote": " Ellmann writes of Sergeant Major Powell, \"He had served many years in the army, took part in the Crimean War and was in the Aldershot Rifles in Australia. On retiring from the service he commuted his pension and bought a farm in Cork. He drank this up, came to Dublin and married a woman with property. She bore him four daughters and a son, then tired of his bullying ways and lived separately from him. Joyce has greatly softened Powell's character\" (46n). \n In Calypso Bloom remembers his father-in-law in a generally admiring way as a self-made man who was smart with money: \"Hard as nails at a bargain, old Tweedy. Yes, sir. At Plevna that was. I rose from the ranks, sir, and I'm proud of it.\" Gifford notes that Tweedy could not have been at Plevna, a battle fought in Bulgaria in 1877 during the Russo-Turkish War, but apparently read about it avidly in a book that now sits on Bloom's bookshelves, Sir Henry Montague Hozier's History of the Russo-Turkish War. In Ithaca Bloom has trouble recalling the name of this \"decisive battle\" so \"frequently remembered by a decisive officer,\" even though he has remembered it readily in Calypso. He resolves to use his \"mnemotechnic\" to recover the name, as he has done once before. His memory of Tweedy as a \"decisive\" man coheres with his admiration of his father-in-law's money skills.\n In Circe Tweedy rises still higher in the ranks when Bloom describes him as \"Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy, one of Britain's fighting men who helped to win our battles.\" Gifford suggests that Bloom is thinking of \"another Tweedie, Maj. Gen. Willis Tweedie (b. 1836). The real-life Tweedie had a considerable reputation as an army commander in India.\" It would have been highly unusual in the 19th century for an enlisted man to rise through the ranks to become any kind of commissioned officer, much less a general: gentlemen and noblemen typically began at the rank of lieutenant, while commoners seldom rose above the rank of sergeant. It seems quite likely that Tweedy, like Powell, was never a commissioned officer. In Penelope Molly remembers how she read a love letter from Lieutenant Mulvey \"while father was up at the drill instructing.\" This implies that Tweedy was a drill sergeant, not a major or a major general.\n Sergeant-majors are usually warrant officers, distinct from higher-ranking commissioned officers on the one hand and lower-ranking enlisted men and non-commissioned officers on the other. They occupy an important and honorific position in the British and many other armies. The fine distinction between warrant officers and commissioned officers, and the confusing use of the term \"major\" to name officers separated by great distances in the hierarchy (sergeant-major, major, major general), might have given a retired officer like Powell the ability to imply a more exalted military status than he in fact could claim, by exploiting civilian incomprehension. Nevertheless, any enlisted man who \"rose from the ranks\" to achieve the exalted rank of sergeant-major might have been justly proud of his accomplishment.\n A little later in Calypso, as Bloom imagines himself wandering through the exotic streets of a Middle Eastern city, he places a version of his father-in-law in the scene: \"come to a city gate, sentry there, old ranker too, old Tweedy's big moustaches, leaning on a long kind of a spear.\" This old man too has risen through the ranks. Apparently the places that Tweedy has seen in his days of army service give him an exotic air in Bloom's mind."

  "010065omphalos": {
    "note": " \"To ourselves... new paganism... omphalos\": Stephen thinks of three very different expressions, all of them apparently associated with Mulligan and his plans for the tower. The phrases encompass a wide range of implied meanings: political, aesthetic, spiritual, sexual. But all seem connected to a countercultural vision: avant-garde and anti-bourgeois. The Greek word omphalos reappears elsewhere in the novel and collects a variety of associations.",
    "expandedNote": " “To ourselves” resembles the English sense of Sinn Féin, “we ourselves.” As Gifford observes, this phrase became a slogan for political independence a year or two after the time represented in the novel. Arthur Griffith visited the tower, and in 1905 Oliver Gogarty worked with him to help organize the movement that in 1907 became Sinn Féin.But in the 1890s and early 1900s the phrase was connected more broadly with the Irish Literary Revival, not simply with politics. \n Its juxtaposition with “new paganism” suggests the cultivation of an Irish aesthetic that is both nationalist and sensualist. This second phrase, Gifford notes, was a slogan of the young artistic avant-garde of the 1890s. It conveyed the idea that Christianity had run its course. Thus it coheres with Mulligan’s Arnoldian conviction that Irish society is too Hebraic and must be \"Hellenised,\" and with his Nietzschean belief in freedom from Christian morality and freedom to pursue selfish impulses. Gifford notes that it was also associated, in the first issue of the Pagan Review in 1892, with “the various forces of sexual emotion.” \n This emphasis upon sexuality suggests a connection with \"omphalos,\" the word for \"navel\" in Greek, which in Mulligan's view is the language of intellectual and sensual liberation. The prophetic oracle at Delphi was called an omphalos, being regarded as the center of the ancient world and a spiritual life-source. Joyce's awareness of this connotation of omphalos is made apparent in Circe, when Mulligan's Black Mass on the top of the tower takes place \"On an eminence, the centre of the earth.\" In Proteus Stephen thinks of \"mystic monks\" who seek to return to the source of all being by meditating on their bellybuttons: \"Will you be as gods? Gaze in your omphalos.\"\n Ellmann suggests that Gogarty called the tower the omphalos both \"because it resembled a navel and because it might prove 'the temple of neo-paganism' as important to the world as the navel-stone at Delphi\" (172). (Another possibility, suggested by Mulligan's telling Haines that William Pitt built many Martellos around Ireland \"But ours is the omphalos,\" is that it was the first of the Martello towers built along the approaches to Dublin.) The top of the tower does resemble a navel, but the whole tower, as well as the navel-stone that Ellmann mentions, might also be seen as phallic in shape. The large sculpted stone that stood at Delphi from the 4th century BCE onward, a replacement for a still more ancient one, survives, and its appearance is certainly more phallic than umbilical. \n One may not have to choose between these two images of the tower. In Oxen of the Sun we learn that Mulligan associates the procreative connotations of navels and phalluses, omphaloi and obelisks. He proposes to acquire a new property, Lambay Island, and to found there “a national fertilising farm to be named Omphalos, with an obelisk hewn and erected after the fashion of Egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the fecundation of any female of any grade of life soever.” Mulligan’s new paganism, it appears, will involve much exercise of his own phallus, in “the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed.”"

  "020067onegreatgoal": {
    "note": " Deasy responds to Stephen's bleak view of history with a classic statement of what Gifford calls \"the Victorian faith in the inevitability of man's moral and spiritual progress\": \"All human history moves toward one great goal, the manifestation of God.\" Gifford observes that \"By the end of the century this faith . . . was widely regarded as a feeble substitute for vital spiritual commitment.\"",
    "expandedNote": " Thornton identifies two close analogues to Deasy's statement: Alfred, Lord Tennyson's hopeful vision of 'one far-off divine event, / To which the whole creation moves,' at the end of In Memoriam (1850), and Matthew Arnold's lines from Westminster Abbey (1881), \"For this and that way swings / The flux of mortal things, / Though moving inly to one far-set goal.\"\n The idea that history has a telos or purposeful end-point had long been associated in western culture with the historiography of the Christian church, whose ideas of apocalypse, revelation, divine judgment, and transformation Joyce contrives to associate, derisively, with the \"goal\" being scored on the hockey field. The Christian conception of history is marked by a beginning (the Creation), a middle (the Incarnation), and an end (the Last Judgment). Although God exists in his incomprehensible fullness of being outside of time, he reveals himself progressively through these (and many other) actions in the forward movement of time. Thus history is seen as the ongoing record of God's self-manifestation, with the fullest revelation coming at the end of time. This linear model can be found in all denominations of Christian belief, and in secular historiographies inspired by Christian belief, such as Hegel's description of human history as a progressively greater manifestation of the Geist or Spirit.\n Against such schemas which depict history as a linear progression from beginning to end, Joyce seems to have preferred circular or cyclical models which describe human experience perpetually revisiting similar states of being, with no clear beginning or end. The early lecture \"Drama and Life\" (1900) describes eternal human truths that express themselves perpetually and unchangingly in human experience. The Viconian historiography of Finnegans Wake augments this eternal sameness with the idea of recurring cycles. \n In Proteus, Stephen continues thinking about ideas of history. He harshly dismisses the triumphant transcendentalism of Deasy's \"one great goal\" when he watches a live dog sniffing a dead one on the tidal flats: \"Dogskull, dogsniff, eyes on the ground, moves to one great goal. Ah, poor dogsbody! Here lies poor dogsbody's body.\" Here, the great goal of life is clearly death. When Stephen contemplates the decomposing body of the drowned man at the end of Proteus, it becomes apparent that his focus on the death of the organic body does not\nrepresent simply a cynical or nihilistic rejection of metaphysical explanations; but it does constitute a rejection of Christian metaphysics."

    "note": " Martha Clifford closes her letter to Henry Flower with a \"P. S. Do tell me what kind of perfume does your wife use. I want to know.\" The novel does eventually give the reader an answer to her question. But a more interesting question is why she wants to know.",
    "expandedNote": " Much later, in Nausicaa, Bloom catches a whiff of Gerty MacDowell's perfume and wonders what kind it is: \"What is it? Heliotrope? No. Hyacinth? Hm. Roses, I think. She’d like scent of that kind. Sweet and cheap: soon sour. Why Molly likes opoponax. Suits her, with a little jessamine mixed. Her high notes and her low notes.\" The context suggests that Molly's blend of opoponax and jasmine is more complex and less cloyingly sweet than many perfumes.\n Opopanax or opoponax, sometimes called \"sweet myrrh,\" is a resin derived by tapping the gummy sap of shrubs and trees of the Commiphora genus, which also produces myrrh and frankincense. The trees grow in Somalia and nearby countries, and their resin has been used in perfumes since biblical times. The presence of myrrh and frankincense among the gifts that the Magi bring to the Christ child suggests how un-\"cheap\" these scents are, and Molly's use of opoponax makes one more link in a chain of details that defines her as exotically Mediterranean: Spanish, Jewish, Arab, Turkish. \n But why should \"Martha\" take the trouble to inquire about her rival's perfume? Clearly it is an intimate question, violating the boundary that separates spouses from the outside world and indicating a desire to move the epistolary flirtation into the realm of physical closeness. It could be that Martha aims to please Henry by smelling just like his wife. A less pathetically self-abasing, more confidently cunning, possibility is that she is thinking practically about the tactics of conducting a sexual affair: Henry's wife could hardly suspect him of infidelity when he comes home bearing her own scent."

  "020040orangelodges": {
    "note": " The \"orange lodges\" were (and are) Protestant fraternal organizations that formed in Deasy's beloved Ulster to celebrate the memory of William of Orange, to violently intimidate Catholics, and to ensure the continuation of British Protestant rule in Ireland. It is highly misleading, at best, to say that they \"agitated for repeal of the union.\"",
    "expandedNote": " The lodges formed in the early 1790s, and soon joined to make up a united Orange Order, Lodge, Institution, or Society that survives to the present day and still organizes supremacist marches through Catholic areas in the north. While it is true that the Order opposed Union when the idea was first being proposed in the 1790s, the Act of Union was not passed until 1800. Orangemen quickly came to support it, and never \"agitated for repeal.\" In the 1870s and 80s, when the Home Rule movement gathered momentum, the Order was inflexibly opposed. Its support for Union with Great Britain has continued throughout the history of Northern Ireland, from 1922 to the present.\n The closest American analogy to the early Orangemen is the Ku Klux Klan. Orange forces randomly attacked and murdered Catholics, destroyed cottages, invaded churches, and mounted public displays of might. There are significant differences: the Americans were reversing the effects of a war that the South had lost, while the Ulster Protestants were preserving the fruits of a war that King William had won; and American blacks could not offer any organized resistance like that mounted by the Irish Catholics called Defenders. Still, Orange opposition to Irish Catholic autonomy has always been unambiguous and coercive. Deasy's picture of Orangemen as making common cause with nationalists like O'Connell could not be more inaccurate."

  "040057orangekeyed": {
    "note": " The chamber pot that the Blooms keep under their bed for nighttime emergencies is described as \"orangekeyed\"—a cryptic adjective. Hugh Kenner makes a persuasive stab at explicating it, inferring that this domestic appliance is decorated with an orange border in the kind of continuous labyrinthine pattern often called a meander, Greek fret, or Greek key. He adds that the compounded epithet has a distinctly Homeric flavor, connecting the Blooms' bodily needs to ancient Greek times.",
    "expandedNote": " Kenner writes, \"'Orangekeyed' is formed the way Homer formed many epithets, of which the most celebrated is rhododaktylos, 'rosyfingered,' by joining an attribute of colour or brightness with a name: in this case the colour, orange, with the name of the pattern around the rim of the pot. This is the 'key meander' or 'key pattern'; the citation for the latter term in the Oxford English Dictionary (s.v. 'key') is dated 1876, in the first decade of Homeric archaeology. Thus as Ulysses in the fresh of the morning sat upon a 'jakes,' a word Sir John Harington's 1596 paean united with 'Ajax' [Bloom visits a \"jakes\" at the end of Calypso], so Penelope in the dead of the night will squat on a piece of ware ornamented with the pattern which characterised much Greek pottery of the Geometric Period, the ninth to seventh centuries BC: pottery of the lifetime (if he lived) of Homer\" (Ulysses, 144). \n In addition to \"rosy-fingered,\" color-based epithets in Homer's poems include \"wine-dark,\" \"bronzed-armored,\" \"grey-eyed\" or \"shining-eyed,\" \"white-armed,\" \"red-haired,\" \"flaming-haired,\" and \"silver-footed.\"\n In Circe, Bloom shocks the newly animated Nymph with thoughts of the things that she has looked down on in his bedroom: him kissing her photo, snoring, flatulence, dirty words, \"Soiled personal linen,\" and brass quoits jingling from sexual activity. Among these corporeal indecencies he mentions \"That antiquated commode\" that broke when Molly was sitting on it, \"And that absurd orangekeyed utensil which has only one handle.\"\n Ithaca notes that the pot was purchased as part of a set: \"Orangekeyed ware, bought of Henry Price, basket, fancy goods, chinaware and ironmongery manufacturer, 21, 22, 23 Moore street, disposed irregularly on the washstand and floor and consisting of basin, soapdish and brushtray (on the washstand, together), pitcher and night article (on the floor, separate).\"\n In Penelope Molly uses the chamberpot when she realizes that her period has started: \"I want to get up a minute if Im let wait O Jesus wait yes that thing has come on me yes now wouldnt that afflict you . . . O patience above its pouring out of me like the sea . . . I dont want to ruin the clean sheets the clean linen I wore brought it on too damn it damn it . . . wheres the chamber gone easy Ive a holy horror of its breaking under me after that old commode . . .

The setting is the ground floor of the Ormond Hotel at 8-9 Upper Ormond Quay, just north of the Liffey and west of Capel Street.

The dining room sits on one side of the bar, then, and a long \"hallway\" on the other. \n The interior of the \"saloon,\" used for smoking and for small evening concerts, must have been visible from the bar, because Simon Dedalus looks from the bar \"towards the saloon door\" and says, \"I see you have moved the piano.\" Miss Douce explains that a piano tuner visited earlier in the day, \"tuning it for the smoking concert.\" Simon, having finished his drink, \"strayed away.\" Soon the hum of a tuning fork emerges from the saloon, and soon after that the notes ofGoodbye, Sweetheart, Goodbye, played by \"sensitive hands. Brightly the keys, all twinkling, linked, all harpsichording.\" The saloon, it appears, had a raised platform for performers and a painting of a sea scene on one wall: \"— M'appari, Simon, Father Cowley said. / Down stage he strode some paces . . . Softly he sang to a dusty seascape there:A Last Farewell. A headland, a ship, a sail upon the billows. Farewell. A lovely girl, her veil awave upon the wind upon the headland, wind around her.\" We also learn, when Ben Dollard's big bass voice \"rolled to the quivery loveshivery roofpanes,\" that the saloon is in a one-story part of the building lit by a skylight. \n As for the dining room, after Bloom crosses the Grattan Bridge from Wellington Quay to Ormond Quay, he sees Boylan doing the same thing in a car. He follows Boylan, sees him enter the bar, and passes \"Between the car and window, warily walking.\" Just beyond the bar, he runs into Richie Goulding, who invites him to share a meal at the Ormond. Bloom thinks, \"Diningroom. Sit tight there. See, not be seen.\" Some part of the dining room must command a view of the bar, and Joyce has already indicated what it is: shortly earlier, the chapter has shown Pat the waiter coming \"to the door of the diningroom\" to fulfill \"a diner's\" request for beer.\n Bloom and Goulding seem to enter through yet another street door (happily avoiding a confrontation with Boylan in the bar), because they pass by set tables rather than bar fixtures: \"The bag of Goulding, Collis, Ward led Bloom by ryebloom flowered tables. Aimless he chose with agitated aim, bald Pat attending, a table near the door. Be near. At four.\" This table near the door into the bar, which Bloom chooses in an \"agitated\" state while trying to appear \"aimless,\" will allow him to look into the bar at 4:00, at which time he knows that Boylan has arranged to meet Molly. When Simon begins singing M'appari, he asks for the door between the two rooms to be propped open: \"Bloom signed to Pat, bald Pat is a waiter hard of hearing, to set ajar the door of the bar.\" \n The fact that the text does not show Bloom passing in front of the bar's quayside windows a second time on his way to the dining room suggests that it lies on the upriver side of the bar. Historical records examined by Harald Beck in an article on James Joyce Online Notes confirm this impression. In the 1890s, the Ormond Hotel occupied only no. 8, and there was a drinking establishment on the ground floor. The 18-foot width of no. 8, specified in the property deed, and the presence of the \"hallway\" occupying part of that width, make it inconceivable that a restaurant could have shared the space. Under new ownership in the early 1900s the hotel expanded into no. 9 on the west side and opened a restaurant.\n Beck's note offers several other findings useful for readingSirens, including a persuasive case that \"the derelict premises still standing today at Nos 7 to 11 Upper Ormond Quay\" contain no \"remnants of the hotel Joyce had in mind.\" He shows also that the hotel's expansion into no. 9 did not begin until late 1905 or early 1906. The layout depicted in the episode, then, did not exist in June 1904. Joyce's mental picture, Beck suggests, came from his memory of visiting the Ormond during his 1912 trip to Ireland. In a 21 August 1912 letter to Stanislaus he wrote, \"I went to see Lidwell last night at the Ormond Hotel\" and found him in \"the company of several others telling stories,\" including John Joyce. Both George Lidwell and Simon Dedalus figure prominently in Sirens, so it is reasonable to suppose that Joyce relied on his anachronistic memory to set the scene."

    "note": " Most of the phrases from the Pater noster, the Lord's Prayer, pop up in Ulysses. The intent is never devotional. Like a song that has been heard too many times, this staple of the Christian liturgy seems capable of inspiring only parody or mockery in Dubliners.",
    "expandedNote": " Some references to the prayer are overtly hostile. In Telemachus Mulligan notes that \"The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi. Lead him not into temptation.\" In Lotus Eaters Bloom looks about him in the church and thinks, \"Blind faith. Safe in the arms of kingdom come.\" And when Bloom is immolated by the Inquisition in Circe, Brother Buzz delivers him to the executioners while sanctimoniously intoning, \"Forgive him his trespasses.\"\n Bloom often quotes phrases from the prayer in the same childlike, whimsical spirit that he brings to nursery rhymes and advertising jingles. In Calypso he thinks of Boland's breadvan \"delivering with trays our daily but she prefers yesterday's loaves turnovers crisp crowns hot.\" In Eumaeus the smell of James Rourke's bakery brings back the phrase \"our daily bread, of all commodities of the public the primary and most indispensable.\" Later in the chapter he transforms the cliché into \"give us this day our daily press.\" These recollections of an overused phrase are quite lame, but Bloom is in better form in Calypso when he notes the perverse fact that watering something will bring on a rainstorm: \"Watering cart. To provoke the rain. On earth as it is in heaven.\" \n The \"Our father who art in heaven\" that begins the prayer regularly makes characters think of absent patriarchs that are all too human. In Hades Bloom remembers his suicidal father's request that he should take good care of his dog Athos, a \"last wish\" presumably honored by his son: \"Thy will be done.\" Stephen imagines Shakespeare as a bitter ghost who demands that his murderous will be done by his son on earth: \"Our Father who art in purgatory. Khaki Hamlets don't hesitate to shoot.\" Boody Dedalus, starving at home with her sisters, speaks of \"Our father who art not in heaven.\" Simon's name is not hallowed in his own house. He is in some bar or other, supplying no daily bread for his children."

    "note": " The money-conscious Mr. Deasy brags to Stephen and challenges him: \"I paid my way. I never borrowed a shilling in my life. Can you feel that? I owe nothing. Can you?\" Mentally ticking through a list of debts, Stephen acknowledges that he cannot say the same. But the problem is far worse than Deasy knows: Stephen's debts are compounded by mad, self-destructive prodigality. He recognizes the problem, but he cannot help himself, as the succeeding events of June 16 poignantly demonstrate.",
    "expandedNote": " Stephen is being paid \"three twelve\" (£3 12s.) for a month's labor (a good salary), but he owes more than £25: \"Mulligan, nine pounds, three pairs of socks, one pair brogues, ties. Curran, ten guineas. McCann, one guinea. Fred Ryan, two shillings. Temple, two lunches. Russell, one guinea, Cousins, ten shillings, Bob Reynolds, half a guinea, Koehler, three guineas, Mrs MacKernan, five weeks' board.\" (Most of the people on his list—Constantine Curran, Fred Ryan, George Russell, James Cousins, T. G. Keller, Mrs. MacKernan, and possibly Bob Reynolds—are actual Dubliners whom Joyce knew. McCann and Temple are fictional characters from the last chapter of A Portrait of the Artist.) Given this dismal balance sheet, Stephen may well conclude that \"The lump I have is useless.\" From the Protestant accountant's perspective, the best that can be said of him is that he does keep careful mental records of his self-ruination.\n For a very young man Stephen has accumulated a fairly staggering sum of debts, and rather than making plans to pay it down, he takes its unpayability as an excuse for blowing what now burns a hole in his pocket on a daylong binge of treating casual acquaintances to drinks. In Proteus, immediately after recalling his appointment to meet Mulligan at \"The Ship, half twelve\"—where Mulligan plans to spend some of his \"Four shining sovereigns\" on \"a glorious drunk\" (Telemachus)—Stephen thinks, \"go easy with that money like a good young imbecile.\" He does dodge the appointment with Mulligan, but only to spend his money treating the men in the newspaper office to drinks. \n [2018] In Oxen of the Sun he has \"two pound nineteen shilling\" left, meaning that he has already spent nearly a sixth of his month's wages on alcohol, and he lies to his companions in the hospital common room, telling them that he has the money \"for a song which he writ.\" This fabrication seems designed to boost his ego as an artist—he is not publishing anything, much less being paid handsomely for it—but it also contributes to the mad spiral of borrowing and spending. A monthly salary for instructing boys in a private school is something that should be saved and spent judiciously. A windfall for happily placing a poem in a journal or book is something to be celebrated over drinks with friends. \n By the time that Bloom takes him under his wing in Circe, offering to safeguard the coins spilling out of his pockets, Stephen has \"one pound six and eleven. One pound seven, say.\" Of the 72 shillings he was paid, only 27 remain—not much more than a third. He happily hands over all his remaining money to Bloom, not because he has reason to trust him and appreciates the offer of a banker, but because he simply doesn't care."

  "040067poordignam": {
    "note": " The man whose funeral Bloom attends in Hades, Patrick (Paddy) Dignam, is fictional, though Joyce modeled his funeral on one he had actually attended for a man named Matthew Francis Kane. Joyce made Dignam emblematic of two corporeal conditions: the universal human liability to becoming suddenly extinct, and the pervasive Dublin flaw of drinking too much alcohol. Both are implicit in the book's first mention of Dignam in Calypso: \"Stop and say a word: about the funeral perhaps. Sad thing about poor Dignam, Mr O'Rourke.\"",
    "expandedNote": " Why should Bloom, who drinks very little, assume that Larry O'Rourke, who owns the pub at the corner of Eccles and Dorset Street, knows Paddy Dignam? Probably because he passes by the pub often and knows that Dignam was a regular customer. In Hades it becomes apparent that Dignam's drinking has cost him a good job, like many other Dubliners in Joyce's fictions. He used to work for John Henry Menton, a solicitor. Menton attends the funeral, and Ned Lambert mentions that he has contributed a pound to the collection that is being taken up for Dignam's wife and children: \n — I'll engage he did, Mr Dedalus said. I often told poor Paddy he ought to mind that job. John Henry is not the worst in the world.\n — How did he lose it? Ned Lambert asked. Liquor, what?\n — Many a good man's fault, Mr Dedalus said with a sigh.\n Simon Dedalus, of course, counts himself among those good men, and has himself lost good jobs along his trail of alcoholic ruin. \n In Penelope Molly thinks approvingly of her husband's refusal to waste their family money in bars the way Dignam has: \"they call that friendship killing and then burying one another and they all with their wives and families at home . . . theyre a nice lot all of them well theyre not going to get my husband again into their clutches if I can help it . . . he has sense enough not to squander every penny piece he earns down their gullets and looks after his wife and family goodfornothings poor Paddy Dignam all the same Im sorry in a way for him what are his wife and 5 children going to do unless he was insured comical little teetotum always stuck up in some pub corner and her or her son waiting Bill Bailey wont you please come home.\"\n Unsurprisingly given the medical science of the time, Dignam's cause of death is not clearly specified in the novel.Oxen of the Sun and Ithaca identify it as \"apoplexy,\" an imprecise medical term which from medieval times until the 20th century could be used for any incident in which the victim suddenly lost consciousness and died. Heart attack and stroke, both of which can be brought on by heavy drinking via raised blood pressure, seem possible, but any such speculation would be extra-literary. Starting in the late 19th century, the term began to acquire its present meaning of internal hemorrhaging. \n Matthew Kane suffered a heart attack while swimming in Dublin Bay off Kingstown Harbor in July 1904. Like Dignam, he had five young children. He also had many friends, and his funeral was much better attended than Dignam's. Among the mourners were James Joyce and his father. In Surface and Symbol, Robert Martin Adams observes that Kane's funeral procession started in Kingstown, went north to Sandymount, and then proceeded to Glasnevin by much the same SE-NW route followed in the novel. \"Prayers were said at the graveside by the Reverend Father Coffey. After the funeral, a meeting was held, at which a sum of money was subscribed to take care of the dead man's children. Unlike its counterpart in the novel, Matthew Kane's funeral was well attended, and the fund for the support of his children was generously subscribed.\" Adams remarks that in substituting Dignam for Cunningham Joyce reduced the actual dead man to a \"ghost-figure, a literary vestige which retains nothing definite in its personality except Elpenor's fiery face\" (62-63). \n In \"Joyce's Use of Lists,\" published in Dublin James Joyce Journal 8 (2015): 122-30, Vivien Igoe observes that James Dignam, a friend of Joyce's father who often attended funerals with him, may have given the writer the surname for his character (130). And in a personal communication Vincent Altman O'Connor reports that \"James Dignam was a close associate and ‘second-in-command’ to Albert Altman in Dublin’s powerful Temperance Movement.\" It seems possible, then, that Joyce displayed a typically perverse sense of humor in choosing Paddy Dignam's surname.\n Dignam's death comes up throughout the day in Bloom's thoughts and his conversation, starting with the explanation he gives M'Coy in Lotus Eaters for being dressed in black: \"Poor Dignam, you know. The funeral is today.\" In Lestrygonians he tells Josie Breen that Dignam was \"An old friend of mine. He died quite suddenly, poor fellow. Heart trouble, I believe. Funeral was this morning.\""

  "010044painfretted": {
    "note": " More than any other human reality, Ulysses is about love—sexual love. June 16, 1904 was the date on which Joyce first went out walking in Ringsend with Nora Barnacle. (She pulled him off inside his pants, andhe was smitten.) Fictionally, it is the day on which the sexual dysfunction in the Blooms’ marriage reaches a climax, as Molly begins an affair with Blazes Boylan. In Telemachus Joyce implicitly connects the crisis in the Blooms' marriage with his young persona's progress toward maturity: \"Pain, that was not yet the pain of love, fretted his heart.\"",
    "expandedNote": " In Proteus Stephen, walking alone on nearby Sandymount Strand, imagines an encounter like the one Joyce found with Nora: “Touch me. Soft eyes. Soft soft soft hand. I am lonely here. O, touch me soon, now.\" He goes on to think, \"What is that word known to all men? I am quiet here alone. Sad too. Touch, touch me.” Gabler’s 1984 edition explicitly answers the question about the “word known to all men,” by adding to Scylla and Charybdis several sentences of internal monologue left out of previous editions: “Do you know what you are talking about? Love, yes. Word known to all men. Amor vero aliquid alicui bonum vult unde et ea quae concupiscimus ...” Whether or not this “correct answer” to the question belongs in the novel, its mere existence in Joyce’s handwriting encourages a reader to suppose that Stephen wishes to understand the emotion of love better than he presently does.\n Gifford traces Stephen's Latin sentence to a passage of Aquinas’ Summa Contra Gentiles, several unconnected phrases of which he recalls and patches together in memory. The sense of the rather contorted Latin is that true love (amor vero) makes one will another person’s good (aliquid alicui bonum vult), whereas those things which we merely desire or covet (ea quae concupiscimus) we desire for our own good, not the good of the other. Aquinas is making an essentially Augustinian distinction between real love (caritas) and mere desire (cupiditas).\n In a preface to the paperback release of Gabler’s edition, Richard Ellmann commented on the inclusion of these sentences as exemplifying the novel’s central message of love. Ellmann's preface observes that the message is announced again in Cyclops, when Bloom argues that force and hatred are not the essence of life: “everybody knows that it’s the very opposite of that that is really life . . . Love.” The Citizen, his antagonist in the pub, immediately mocks the Jew for promoting a Christian message of “Universal love,” and the narrative itself chimes in by mockingly chanting, “Love loves to love love . . . You love a certain person. And this person loves that other person because everybody loves somebody but God loves everybody.” \n This may be sheer “twaddle,” Ellmann observes, but it aligns Bloom’s world-view more or less with that of Aquinas, for whom love is a universal cosmic principle deriving from God. The annihilating mockery “protects seriousness by immediately going away from intensity.” But while diverted from “didacticism or sentimentality, we perceive that the word known to the whole book is love in its various forms, sexual, parental, filial, brotherly, and by extension social. It is so glossed by Stephen, Bloom, and Molly.” Ellmann’s un-Christian conclusion: “Affection between human beings, however transitory, however qualified, is the closest we can come to paradise.” The human love that Stephen is struggling to discover, and that Bloom and Molly are simply struggling with, represents a kind of universal principle in the novel, comparable to (but radically different from) the divine love expounded by Christian writers.\n In A Portrait, Stephen’s one significant literary accomplishment was a love poem addressed to the young woman identified only as E. C. It is radiantly beautiful, but filled with Catholic notions of sin. On the last page of the novel Stephen encounters E. C. after a long absence, and she \"Asked me, was I writing poems? About whom? I asked her. This confused her more and I felt sorry and mean. Turned off that valve at once and opened the spiritual-heroic refrigerating apparatus, invented and patented in all countries by Dante Alighieri. Talked rapidly of myself and my plans.\"\n These plans include moving to Paris and becoming an artist, but before he does so another woman intrudes into his diary, recommending the emotional understanding that he needs to become an artist: \"Mother is putting my new secondhand clothes in order. She prays now, she says, that I may learn in my own life and away from home and friends what the heart is and what it feels. Amen. So be it.\" The sentence in Telemachus suggests that he has made little progress on this front since leaving home."

  "030116panshour": {
    "note": " As Stephen lies back on the rocks to nap, he thinks, \"I am caught in this burning scene. Pan's hour, the faunal noon.\" The Romans associated the Greek god Pan with their own rural demigods called \"fauns,\" who were libidinous denizens of the countryside, half-human and half-goat in shape. Stephen may be thinking of one particular faun, the figure in Stéphane Mallarmé's celebrated poem L'après-midi d'un faune, \"The after-noon of a faun\" (1876).",
    "expandedNote": " An \"églogue\" or pastoral revery, L'après-midi d'un faune is spoken by a faun who wakes up from an afternoon nap and thinks desirously about two nymphs he has encountered (in a dream? in actuality?) He wants to make the thought of them endure: \"je les veux perpétuer.\" The end of the poem finds him lying under the sun on the hot sand, unable to do justice to the vision. \n William York Tindall was the first to suggest that Stephen is recalling this poem, in A Reader's Guide to James Joyce (1959). Gifford finds the connection convincing, noting that Mallarmé's poem emphasizes heat just as Stephen does, and that its description of \"l'heure fauve\" (the tawny hour), thick with heat and heavy with foliage, is picked up in Stephen's next sentence: \"Among gumheavy serpentplants, milkoozing fruits, where on the tawny waters leaves lie wide.\" He observes, though, that if Stephen is thinking of the poem he changes its bitter-sweet condition to a more idyllic one: \"Pain is far.\" \n Stephen's images of heavy foliage and languid ease anticipate Bloom's thoughts in the third paragraph of Lotus Eaters, and his impulse to nap on the seashore corresponds to Bloom's nodding off at the end of Nausicaa."

  "010077pantomime": {
    "note": " The \"pantomime,\" not to be confused with the silent gestures of mimes, was a popular theatrical form in Victorian and Edwardian England and Ireland. It was often called \"panto,\" as in the Nymph's reference to \"immoral panto boys in fleshtights\" in Circe. In Dublin, pantomime shows like \"Turko the Terrible\" and \"Sinbad the Sailor\" were performed at all three of the city's principal theaters: the Theatre Royal, the Gaiety Theatre, and the Queen's Theatre.",
    "expandedNote": " Pantomime originated in the ancient world. The Greek name originally indicated that the actor or actors “imitate all,\" and quite a bit is known about a low Roman art form of that name, which featured a male dancer telling mythical or legendary stories. But the modern form can more plausibly be traced back to the Mummers Play of medieval England and the Commedia dell’arte of Renaissance Italy. Theaters in Restoration and 18th century England adapted elements of the Commedia, and in the early years of Queen Victoria's reign a new kind of popular but sophisticated show took shape, based on children’s fairy tales that everyone in the audience could be assumed to know, including northern European ones like Cinderella, Mother Goose, Dick Whittington, and Humpty Dumpty, and also exotic foreign stories like Aladdin, Ali Baba, Sinbad, and Robinson Crusoe. These entertainments, which spread to all the farflung parts of the empire, were, like mummers' plays, usually performed in the Christmas and New Year season.\n Using one fairy tale as a broad canvas, the shows featured many diverse kinds of free, improvisatory entertainment: dances, well-known popular songs set to new lyrics, cross-dressing roles, slapstick comedy, evil villains and good fairies, clowns, jugglers, acrobats, topical allusions and jokes, sexual innuendo, appearances by local guest stars, and frequent audience participation: watchers were expected to shout out suggestions to the performers and sing along with well-known songs. The story line ran very loosely through all these incidentals, and tended to be wrapped up quickly and unrealistically. English and Irish theaters have kept the panto tradition alive to the present day.\n The \"Turko the terrible\" that Stephen thinks of in Telemachus, and Bloom in Calypso,had been performed in Dublin for decades. Thornton notes that William Brough’s pantomime Turko the Terrible; or, The Fairy Roses, first performed in 1868 at London's Gaiety Theatre, was adapted by the Irish author Edwin Hamilton for performance in Dublin's Gaiety Theatre, first in 1873 and then many times more in the remainder of the 19th century. Bloom thinks of Turko as he imagines himself wandering through the streets of a Middle Eastern city. In Circe, Molly’s father, Major Brian Tweedy, acquires this exotic aspect. \n \"Old Royce,\" whom Stephen thinks of playing the role, was Edward William Royce, an English comic actor who often performed parts in pantomimes. His presence in Stephen's thoughts may owe to the fact that he appeared as Turko in performances of an unrelated pantomime that Joyce could well have attended. Robert Martin Adams observes that in the Sinbad the Sailor of 1892-93, \"Mr. E. W. Royce was one of the featured performers; and his appearance was billed as the first since his return from Australia. He took the part of Turko the Terrible, not that this part was an invariable feature of Sinbad the Sailor . . . but because, as an old Dublin favorite, he had to be worked in somehow\" (Surface and Symbol 77-78). \n In Ithaca Bloom thinks of “the grand annual Christmas pantomime Sinbad the Sailor,” performed in December 1892 and January 1893 at the Gaiety Theatre. As the poster reproduced here shows, he correctly identifies the theater manager as \"Michael Gunn, lessee of the Gaiety Theatre,\" but he is quite mistaken that the show was \"written by Greenleaf Whittier.\" An obscure author named Greenleaf Withers penned the script, not the famous (and highminded) 19th century American poet John Greenleaf Whittier. Adams points out this mistake, as well as the fact that Joyce has combined two of the actresses, Kate Neverist and Nellie Bouverie, into \"Nelly Bouverist, principal girl.\" \n Adams also reflects on the many pieces of information that Joyce learned about Sinbad (some included in the account in Ithaca, and many others omitted) from an advertisement touting the show that ran on p. 4 of the Freeman's Journal on 24 and 26 December 1892. Among the details in the ad was an announcement of a spectacular episode in scene 6:\n GRAND BALLET\n of\n DIAMONDS\n and\n SERPENTINE DANCE\n Bloom recalls wanting to write \"a topical song (music by R. G. Johnston)\" to insert into \"the sixth scene, the valley of diamonds, of the second edition (30 January 1893)\" of the pantomime. The changing of \"ballet\" into \"valley\" in all editions of the novel (Gabler's included) might be supposed to represent a failure of memory on Joyce's part or Bloom's. But \"the valley of diamonds,\" in the second of Sinbad's seven voyages, is a place where diamonds lie scattered about on the ground. Merchants harvest them by throwing out pieces of meat that are snatched up by giant birds called rocs, then driving the birds away from their nests and collecting the diamonds that have stuck to the meat. As he drops off to sleep Bloom is still thinking of Sinbad, and of rocs.\n JH 2020"

  "050029peri": {
    "note": " When the tram passes between Bloom and the woman he is eyeing for a glimpse of underwear, and he realizes that he has \"Lost it,\" he thinks of \"Paradise and the peri,\" a verse tale by the Irish poet Thomas Moore. The peri is an angel- or fairy-like being of Persian mythology who is shut out of paradise.",
    "expandedNote": " Moore (1779-1852), who was probably inspired by the presence of peri in William Beckford's oriental novel Vathek (1786), created \"Paradise and the Peri\" as one of four interpolated tales within a frame story titled Lalla Rookh, an Oriental Romance (1817). After his death it was published in a stand-alone volume from which the illustration beside this note is taken. Robert Schumann wrote a cantata called Paradise and the Peri (1843) based on a translation of Moore's work, and Thomas Crawford made a life-size marble sculpture called Peri at the Gates of Paradise (ca. 1856). \n The peri originated in Persia and later spread to Armenia, Turkey, and India. They were lovely female spirits, devoted to beauty and generally well-disposed toward both human beings and God, who were nevertheless denied a place in paradise because of some unnamed mischief. In the version of their story told by the poet-king in Moore's Lalla Rookh, one peri struggles to gain entrance into heaven. The tale begins with the verses inscribed in the first of the images here:\n One morn a Peri at the gate\n Of Eden stood, disconsolate;\n And as she listen'd to the Springs\n Of Life within, like music flowing,\n And caught the light upon her wings\n Through the half-open portal glowing,\n She wept to think her recreant race\n Should e'er have lost that glorious place!\n A \"glorious angel\" who is guarding the gate takes pity on the peri and tells her that she can be admitted if she offers \"the gift that is most dear to Heaven.\" She speeds off to earth looking for this precious substance, and returns twice with gifts that do not fit the bill. On her third try she encounters a \"man of crime\" who sees a young boy playing and weeps \"tears of soul-felt penitence.\" One of these blessed tears from his cheek gets the peri into paradise.\n In Bloom's application, the story of the peri is essentially turned on its head. Instead of a beautiful female spirit gazing past the pearly gates into a heaven whose incorporeal splendors she longs to taste, he stands outside the gates of the Grosvenor hotel gazing at a beautiful female and longing to get inside her drawers. \n Bloom's brief recollection of Moore's orientalizing work is one of a long catalogue of passages that show Joyce's interest in the Persian and Arab cultures of the Middle East. In some of these passages exoticism amplifies eroticism, and vice versa. In \"Araby,\" the third story of Dubliners, the boy carries his intoxicating image of Mangan's sister \"even in places the most hostile to romance,\" and when she asks him whether he will be going to the \"splendid bazaar\" that is coming to town he thinks he has found an objective correlative for his subjective passion: \"At night in my bedroom and by day in the classroom her image came between me and the page I strove to read. The syllables of the word Araby were called to me through the silence in which my soul luxuriated and cast an Eastern enchantment over me.\" \n Bloom's investment in this strain of oriental eroticism surfaces repeatedly in Circe. Molly appears to him \"in Turkish costume\"—\"scarlet trousers and jacket, slashed with gold,\" a yellow sash around her waist, a coin on her forehead, jewelled rings on her toes, \"a slender fetterchain\" on her ankles, and a \"white yashmak, violet in the night,\" covering her face. As he stands flirting with Zoe outside of Bella Cohen's house, his hand \"feeling for her nipple,\" she says, \"Stop that and begin worse. Have you cash for a short time? Ten shillings?\" Bloom's reply: \"More, houri, more.\""

  "080008parallax": {
    "note": " \"Parallax\" is an optical phenomenon that enables astronomers to compute the distances to nearby stars, but the basic idea can be grasped without any technical knowledge. Scientists use this term for the change in an object's apparent position brought about by change in the observer's position. In Lestrygonians Bloom thinks that he has tried and failed to understand the concept, but he recalls what Molly has said about another Greek word, metempsychosis: \"She's right after all. Only big words for ordinary things on account of the sound.\" Joyce goes out of his way to suggest that Bloom could, should, and perhaps latently does understand the idea, which has great relevance to his habits of thought and to the narrative art of Ulysses.",
    "expandedNote": "Walking past the Aston Quay \"timeball\" that fell each day at 1 PM to let ships on the Liffey reset their chronometers, Bloom thinks that it runs on time established by the Dunsink Observatory on the northwest edge of Dublin, which in turn reminds him of a Dublin-born astronomer who had long been the director before taking a post at Cambridge in 1892: \"After one. Timeball on the ballastoffice is down. Dunsink time. Fascinating little book that is of sir Robert Ball's. Parallax. I never exactly understood. There's a priest. Could ask him. Par. It's Greek. Parallel, parallax.\" Dictionaries of ancient Greek define parallax as the adverbial form of parallassein = to change. Like \"parallel\" it is built from the prefix para = beside, near, beyond, apart from, contrary to. \n Sir Robert Ball (1840-1913) delivered some 2,500 lectures on popular science and wrote about astronomy in straightforward prose. Ithaca reveals that his \"little book,\" The Story of the Heavens (1886), sits on Bloom's bookshelf in \"blue cloth\" covers. The book often employs the concept of parallax in somewhat challenging ways, but it illustrates the basic idea with an experiment that any sighted person can perform:\n We must first explain clearly the conception which is known to astronomers by the name of parallax; for it is by parallax that the distance of the sun, or, indeed, the distance of any other celestial body, must be determined. Let us take a simple illustration. Stand near a window whence you can look at buildings, or the trees, the clouds, or any distant objects. Place on the glass a thin strip of paper vertically in the middle of one of the panes. Close the right eye, and note with the left eye the position of the strip of paper relatively to the objects in the background. Then, while still remaining in the same position, close the left eye and again observe the position of the strip of paper with the right eye. You will find that the position of the paper on the background has changed. (181-82)\n A recursive loop later in Lestrygonians indicates that Bloom may have grasped the idea here, that different lines of sight will afford slightly different contextual views of an object. Standing in front of Yeates & Son, a shop that sold precision optics, he recalls that the timeball on the quayside corner of the Ballast Office was linked not to Dunsink but to the Greenwich Observatory southeast of London. Dunsink time was displayed on the clockface on the building's Westmoreland Street façade: \"Now that I come to think of it, that ball falls at Greenwich time. It's the clock is worked by an electric wire from Dunsink. Must go out there some first Saturday of the month. If I could get an introduction to professor Joly or learn up something about his family. That would do to: man always feels complimented. Flattery where least expected. Nobleman proud to be descended from some king's mistress. His foremother. Lay it on with a trowel. Cap in hand goes through the land. Not go in and blurt out what you know you're not to: what's parallax? Show this gentleman the door. / Ah. / His hand fell again to his side. / Never know anything about it. Waste of time.\" More in a moment on Bloom's raised hand, which strongly suggests that he once tried Sir Robert's experiment.\n In 1904 the Dunsink observatory was indeed open to the public on the first Saturday of every month, and another eminent Irish astronomer, Charles Joly, was the director. Bloom supposes that if he showed up for one of these open houses, flattery might induce Joly to disclose a mystery that learned scientists keep hidden from ordinary people. His scheming is comically, poignantly unnecessary. In a blog published by theAtlantic on 2 February 2012, \"Joyce and the Internet: What Leopold Bloom Didn't Know,\" Alan Jacobs observes that specialized scientific knowledge was indeed much harder to come by in Bloom's time than it is now, when popular science writing abounds and everything under the sun can be found on the internet, but Bloom already has all he needs: a copy of Ball's book, and a prime example of parallax in the two discordant times.\n Greenwich time was approximately 25 minutes ahead of Dunsink time. When the highly accurate timeball fell at 1 PM, the highly accurate clock on the same building showed 12:35. Why? Because astronomers at the two observatories, sighting the sun at the same moment, saw it standing in two slightly different places in the sky. The novel's way of introducing these time differences suggests that Joyce did not include the disparity as a mere scientific curiosity, but rather to indicate that Bloom understands parallax better than he thinks he does. Why have parallax occur to him just after reflecting on the timeball's link to Dunsink, and then again just after remembering that it is linked to Greenwich, if not to imply some latent awareness of its relevance to the different times?\n This inference from Joyce's textual juxtapositions is strengthened by the remarkable fact that Lestrygonians offers a second instance of Bloom almost glimpsing parallax, now in a more directly visual way. And here we return to the raised hand. In a personal communication,Vincent Van Wyk has suggested to me that the little experiment that Bloom performs while standing in front of Yeates & Son may be relevant to parallax: \"He faced about and, standing between the awnings, held out his right hand at arm's length towards the sun. Wanted to try that often. Yes: completely. The tip of his little finger blotted out the sun's disk. Must be the focus where the rays cross. If I had black glasses.\" All of Bloom's thoughts about Professor Joly take place during this interval while he stands pointing a finger at the sun.\n The hypothesis he is testing is fairly trivial. His finger is vastly less wide than the sun, but it is also vastly closer, so sun and finger appear to be the same size, and the one is \"blotted out\" by the other. This is plausible enough. The writer of a 2009 blog called \"Bloom's little finger\" on The peacocks' tail, a website devoted to mathematics and culture, points out that the moon can eclipse the sun because the distances involved are coincidentally perfect for making their diameters appear equal. In the same way, a soccer ball will cover the sun at a distance of 25 meters from the observer, and an orange will do the trick at a distance of 10 meters. \n But two odd details in Bloom's experiment suggest a different scientific interest. One is the conceptual apparatus that he proposes. He thinks that his finger makes a \"focus\" (i.e., a focal point) where \"rays cross,\" coming from far edges of the sun and slicing past his eyes on the opposite sides, as light rays focused by a lens will do. This may be true, but such a model is not needed to explain his finger's eclipse of the sun, and, as will be seen in a moment, it has considerable relevance to the phenomenon of parallax. A second problematic detail, which the writer of the blog fails to observe, is that a finger held at arm's length from the eyes will not eclipse the sun quite so perfectly as the moon does. The sun disappears if one eye is kept closed, but not if both are open. (Try this at home, carefully!) Bloom must be looking with one eye closed, then. His wish for \"black glasses\" indicates awareness of the pain he would suffer if he opened the other.\n And this means that he is almost but not quite performing the experiment he read about in Sir Robert Ball's book. The book proposes fixing a thin strip of paper to a window pane, but raising a finger is just as effective. The illustration here shows how a raised thumb will appear to move across the background when one eye is closed and the other opened. The line of sight from the left eye to the finger affords one view of the background, while the line from the right eye gives a slightly different view. Bloom is perfectly positioned to confirm this finding (at the risk of burning his retina), but he does not perform the crucial step of switching eyes.\n The idea of rays crossing at a focus also evokes parallax. Scientists had noted as early as the 16th century that nearby stars might be seen moving across a field of more distant stars, because every six months the earth's revolution around the sun takes it to a new vantage point similar to that of a second eye. Viewing a nearby star in January and again in July should make it appear to move across the background, because it forms a kind of focal point for rays coming from two different parts of the sky. Just as animal brains process the angle described by slightly different images to gauge distance, astronomers should be able to measure the angle at this focus and mathematically calculate the star's distance. The greater the distance to the star (d in the first astronomical sketch), the less it would \"move\" (as shown in the bottom figure of the second sketch), yielding a smaller measurable angle (p). With more movement and a larger angle (as in the top figure), the distance would be less. Since all stars but one are so very far away in comparison to the earth's solar orbit, these differences would be small, and measuring the angles would require good instruments. Robert Hooke made a heroic attempt in the 1670s, but not until 1838 did better instruments give scientists reliable ways of gauging the distances. \n Parallax is a valuable tool because astronomical sightings are inherently limited. A celestial body's location can never be more than relative or apparent. The universe has no center, no boundary, no fixed reference points, no universal positioning grid. Planets, stars, and galaxies spin toward or away from one another in a vast cosmic flux that astronomers call \"stellar drift,\" a term echoed in Ithaca: \"the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars, in reality evermoving wanderers from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote futures.\" We peek into this complexity like people viewing a huge whirling dance through a keyhole. Stars may have ceased to exist by the time their light reaches our eyes. Constellations obtain their shapes only from our spatial location, and in a few thousand years those shapes will be utterly transformed. \n Such indeterminacy can set the mind reeling, as Bloom's does in Lestrygonians just after he decides that trying to understand parallax is a waste of time: \"Gasballs spinning about, crossing each other, passing. Same old dingdong always. Gas: then solid: then world: then cold: then dead shell drifting around, frozen rock, like that pineapple rock.\" Even observations here on earth enjoy no real immunity from relativity. Until 19th century railroads created a need for temporal uniformity, Greenwich and Dunsink time differed not only from one another but from that of most other English and Irish localities. Spatial relations too are relative: the driver of a pickup truck sees a tree first on the right flank of a mountain, and then on its left flank, but the tree stands in no such relation to the hill. Its apparentlocation is determined by the location of the motorist.\n Joyce had no use for mathematical computation of distances, but he found almost endless literary analogues for parallax itself—the different views of an object obtained from different positions. Ulysses extends the idea from optics into the mental realm by a kind of implied analogy: just as eyes take in the shifting spatial relationships of the universe from different locations, yielding different views, objects of thought take on different appearances according to the angle from which they are viewed. One's subject-position, which varies from individual to individual and even from moment to moment in a single consciousness, affects what one sees.\n In Lestrygonians food looks different to Bloom depending on whether he is in Burton's slovenly restaurant orDavy Byrne's pristine pub. Lemon sole seems elegant in a fancy hotel, and \"Still it's the same fish perhaps old Micky Hanlon of Moore street ripped the guts out of making money hand over fist finger in fishes' gills can't write his name on a cheque.\" Bloom characteristically flops back and forth in this way, seeing things first from one vantage point and then from another. It marks him as a practitioner of parallax. In Hades he listens to Simon Dedalus fulminating about Buck Mulligan and thinks, \"Noisy selfwilled man. Full of his son. He is right. Something to hand on.\" Between the second sentence and the third, Bloom shifts from the perspective of an outsider who is barely tolerated by men like Simon to the empathic view of a father who has lost a son. From this angle, Simon's angry pride appears very different. \n In Cyclops, the Homeric parallel turns the denizens of Barney Kiernan's pub into one-eyed troglodytes who scorn binocular vision: Alf Landon says of \"Poor old sir Frederick\" Falconer that \"you can cod him up to the two eyes.\" (According to the OED, \"up to the eyes\" means \"to the limit.\" Alf adds the number.) In this monocular environment Bloom's tendency to see things from multiple angles invites ridicule. A discussion of reviving manly native Irish sports prompts him to observe that strenuous exercise can be bad for someone with a bad heart, which excites the narrator's contempt: \"I declare to my antimacassar if you took up a straw from the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom: Look at, Bloom. Do you see that straw? That's a straw. Declare to my aunt he'd talk about it for an hour so he would and talk steady.\" But a straw is not just a straw. To a famished horse it is one thing, to a phlegmy drinker another, to the man who sweeps the floor still another. Bloom's inclination to look at things from different points of view identifies him as a complex life form, one with stereoscopic depth of understanding.\n Molly performs the same perpetual adjustments, regularly using \"still\" and \"but\" locutions like those of her husband. At the beginning of her chapter she criticizes Bloom for pandering to old Mrs. Riordan in hopes of getting an inheritance from her, but then thinks, \"still I like that in him polite to old women like that and waiters and beggars too.\" Such flip-flops occur throughout Penelope, especially in Molly's attitudes toward her husband. They are contained in her endless repetitions of the word Yes, which open the chapter in a spirit of suspicious skepticism and close it with joyful affirmation. Stephen too practices parallax: his insistence that Haines be evicted from the tower dissipates when Mulligan proposes giving him a violent \"ragging,\" and his fantasy of blowing an insolent doorman to bits with a shotgun flips over into a recuperative fantasy of reconstituting the bloody bits into a person. As he thinks later in Proteus, \"Ah, see now! Falls back suddenly, frozen in stereoscope. Click does the trick.\"\n Ulysses offers countless instances of intersubjective parallax—different individuals' dissimilar views of the same object. Molly and Bloom are always correcting each other in this way. So too, from a greater distance, are Bloom and Stephen. Joyce makes one such discrepancy particularly suggestive of parallax by having the two men view the same celestial object from slightly different angles. In TelemachusStephen sees a cloud begin to cover the sun from Sandycove, at nearly the same time (but not quite) that Bloom sees it from north Dublin. The swallowing of the sun provokes dark thoughts of divine judgment and personal despair in both men, but in slightly different ways: Stephen thinks of his mother's ghoulish visitation while Bloom thinks about Sodom and Gomorrha, the Dead Sea, and sterility. In Ithaca, Stephen attributes the crisis he experienced in the brothel, precipitated by his mother's hallucinated reappearance, to the influence of this \"matutinal cloud,\" while in Oxen of the Sun Bloom's thoughts of having no son give way to a nightmarish vision of Palestine as a wasteland: \"And on the highway of the clouds they come, muttering thunder of rebellion, the ghosts of beasts. Huuh! Hark! Huuh! Parallax stalks behind and goads them.\"\n Parallax also describes the bewildering variety of perspectives on the book's actions taken by its many modes of narrative presentation. From the first page, traditional third-person objective narration veers into the subjective orbits of certain characters. At times, notably in the third and last chapters, interior monologue swamps exterior narration, leaving the reader at the mercy of a character's shifting thoughts, uncertain of what exactly may be happening in the world at large. But objective narration too proves shifty. In an unending series of experimental presentations of the action—newspaper headlines, stage directions, parodic styles, catechistic questions and answers—the novel makes its readers jump from one viewpoint to another. It is filled with instants when new perspectives pop into view: the moment when free indirect style evocative of Gerty's thoughts suddenly gives way to interior monologue conveying Bloom's, the moment when a first-person narrator suddenly declares his existence in a third-person book, the moment when people in the library suddenly become dramatic characters in a script. In Wandering Rocks parallax returns to its unmetaphorical, purely visual roots, with sudden filmlike cuts from one scene to another.\n In The Book As World (1976), Marilyn French observed that because of such constantly shifting views Parallax \"could have served as a title for this novel\" (106). She did not think, however, that the polymorphous subjectivity ruled out the possibility of objective knowledge: \"The fact that various characters walk the same streets, see the same shops or the same 'matutinal cloud,' or meet the same people confers on these streets, shops, cloud, and people a solidity, a reality. One way to test the reality of an object is to compare one's perceptions with those of others . . . Joyce builds into his book the solid substance of things. This is all the more necessary since the modes of perceiving them are so spaced out, so private and eccentric\" (27). \n In his critical study Ulysses (1987, first published 1980), Hugh Kenner too observed that the novel's pointillist perspectivism has the effect of substantiating objective reality: \"Parallax makes possible stereoscopic vision: 'In order to see that basket,' Stephen instructs Lynch in the Portrait, 'your mind first of all separates the basket from the rest of the visible universe which is not the basket' (212), something the mind can do more easily since two eyes have presented it with separate versions of the basket's location. Two different versions at least, that is Joyce's normal way; and the uncanny sense of reality that grows in readers of Ulysses page after page is fostered by the neatness with which versions of the same event, versions different in wording and often in constituent facts—separated, moreover, by tens or hundreds of pages—reliably render one another substantial\" (75). \n Kenner selects more or less randomly the example of Bloom seeing George Russell walking his bike on a route leading to Kildare Street, and Russell then appearing in the National Library in the next chapter: \"This does much to assure us that Bloom really did see Russell, a substantial Russell in motion through Dublin's Newtonian space\" (75). Bloom's recollection of Robert Ball's book in Lestrygonians, supplemented by its appearance on his bookshelf in Ithaca, prompts Kenner to observe that \"each speck in this book has somewhere its complementary speck, in a cosmos we can trust\" (76). The narrative presentation of Dlugacz in Calypso, followed by Bloom's memory of slightly different details about the butcher later in the chapter, illustrates his claim that \"virtually every scene in Ulysses is narrated at least twice, and by varying what he tells and emphasises Joyce ensures that repetition shall not dilute but intensify\" (76).\n French's and Kenner's sensible critical responses to Joyce's fiction cohere with the scientific concept, which does not imply that celestial objects cannot be known, or that varied observations will involve irreconcilable discrepancies. Parallax implies only that stars will take on slightly different appearances against different backgrounds. The objects of human knowledge represented in Ulysses become more fully known when seen from new perspectives—the more the better."

  "170003parallelcourses": {
    "note": " Episode 17 (usually known by the Homeric name Ithaca) takes the form of a catechism, the kind of Q & A dialogue by which Catholic schoolchildren are indoctrinated in the faith. (Joyce had to memorize two of them before his 10th birthday.) But rather than using theology to explain the ways of God, this catechism uses science to explain the ways of the material world. Scientific inquiry is certainly not evoked by all of its hyper-rationalistic questions and answers, but the first pair sets a distinctive tone by using geometry to describe the \"parallel courses\" which Stephen and Bloom \"follow\" to Bloom's house.",
    "expandedNote": " The schema that Joyce gave to Stuart Gilbert lists \"Cathechism (impersonal)\" as the technique of Ithaca, and \"Science\" as its art. We see this pairing in action in the first Q & A, which describe the route that the two men follow on their way from the cabman's shelter to Bloom's house, the varying paces at which they follow it, and their physical connection or separation at various points along the route, as two \"parallel courses\"—a strangely abstract way of describing the perfectly ordinary phenomenon of two people walking this way and that, but always at about the same distance from one another. \n Similarly, at the end of the paragraph, the perfectly ordinary experience of cutting across the interior of a circular path to shave off distance is laid out schematically as a geometry problem: \"they crossed both the circus before George's church diametrically, the chord in any circle being less than the arc which it subtends.\" A mathematician would say, as the physicist on the Rutgers website to the right does, that \"As A becomes smaller, the chord length d becomes a better approximation to the arc length d', that is, d ~ d'.\" And, conversely, as angle A increases, the ratio of d to d' becomes progressively smaller, so the greatest reduction in length will be achieved when the angle is maximized at 180 degrees. At this angle, arc d' will equal D x 3.14159, while chord d will equal D x 2, a significant savings of energy for two tired walkers. \n These walkers are indeed maximizing their energy savings, because they cross the \"circus\" in front of St. George's church—the Latin word means simply circle, and in British usage it refers to an open circular plaza where streets converge—\"diametrically,\" i.e. by hewing to the straight line that will take them through the very center. \n Readers who find such uses of language arcane, tedious, or irrelevant to the conduct of life may initially be put off by Ithaca. But they will quickly find its questions and answers to be far more playful, adventurous, and liberating than those of The Maynooth Catechism. And, for some modern readers at least, the subjects covered in the chapter will seem more relevant to the problems of life than learning exactly how many angels can dance on the head of a pin."

  "010051paresis": {
    "note": " Mulligan repeats, to Stephen, a fellow medical student's surmise that Stephen has \"g. p. i.,\" or \"General paralysis of the insane\"—an outdated medical term for tertiary syphilis, syphilis of the central nervous system. The insult may not be quite as insensitive as it first appears, but it also seems to have acquired a sharper edge retrospectively from the medical problems that later appeared in Joyce's family.",
    "expandedNote": " General paresis, or general paralysis of the insane, or paralytic dementia, was a severe affliction of the brain first diagnosed in the early 19th century and originally attributed to moral failings. In the 1880s physicians established a link to syphilis (a biological cause, but certainly involving moral failings!), and in the 20th century various medicines, culminating in penicillin, were found effective in treating the condition. Before that, g.p.i. had a 100% fatality rate, and it filled countless beds in psychiatric hospitals. \n Gifford observes that medical students sometimes used the term as joking slang for mere eccentricity, and Slote cites Eric Partridge's Dictionary of Slang to that effect. Arguments have been made, however—notably by Kathleen Ferris—that Joyce did suffer from advanced syphilis. The mental illness of his daughter Lucia was reportedly diagnosed as schizophrenia in the 1930s, and Ferris acknowledges that that condition could account for some of her symptoms. But syphilitic paresis accounts for more, she suggests, and can be caused by spirochetes transmitted in utero (106-11). Lucia once told her father “that she had syphilis” (111). Ferris sees the evidence of this disease in Joyce's fictional offspring as well: Stephen and Bloom, she argues, between them display an assortment of symptoms (stiff walk, bad eyesight, digestive problems, hallucinations) that might be caused by syphilis. \n Syphilis aside, Joyce’s works contain a number of instances of mental imbalance. The mother in Eveline (a story in Dubliners) lived a “life of commonplace sacrifices closing in final craziness,” and the old man in An Encounter seems deeply disturbed. Walking down a lane in A Portrait, Stephen hears “a mad nun screeching in the nuns’ madhouse beyond the wall. — Jesus! O Jesus! Jesus!” Ulysses introduces two disturbed individuals in Lestrygonians: Dennis Breen, and Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell. When Bloom points out the “dotty” Farrell to Breen’s wife, she replies, “Denis will be like that one of these days.” Haines, with his predatory nightmares and itchy trigger finger, is \"A woful lunatic!\" Even the even-tempered Bloom fears slipping into insanity, perhaps because of his father's suicide. In Ithaca, we learn that he fears \"The committal of homicide or suicide during sleep by an aberration of the light of reason.\""

    "expandedNote": " Gifford observes that Stephen is remembering the interior of the hall, not the entrance. The \"steps\" on which \"the goldskinned men\" are standing \"under maladroit silk hats\" are \"the parquet, at the end, a railed-off space which the sworn brokers . . . are alone privileged to enter.\" He is quoting from Baedeker's 1907Paris and Its Environs, which also advises visitors that admission is free but \"the crush is anything but pleasant.\"\n Thornton argues that the crush of stockbrokers in the temple \"may recall the description of the moneychangers in the temple\" in all four Christian gospels."

In 2011, however, a software developer named Rory McCann used a computer algorithm to thread the maze.",
    "expandedNote": " McCann, a UCD computer science graduate, did it by defining borders along the Royal Canal and the Grand Canal (the commonly recognized boundaries of Dublin in Joyce's time), plotting the locations of over a thousand pubs within those borders on a street map, establishing an exclusion zone from the front of every pub defined by a parameter of 35 meters, staking out 15 points along the northern boundary and 15 along the southern one, and writing a program whose task was to find a route from some point on the northern border to some point on the southern one, traveling along city streets and avoiding the exclusion zones.\n As soon as McCann published a result, members of his online community wrote to inform him of pubs that he had not included on his map. Hah! After several iterations, the computer found a single route from the northwest to the southeast that McCann feels reasonably confident about. Interestingly, although the plotted route avoids every pub on McCann's map, it did manage to pass directly by the Guinness brewery at St. James' Gate. Hah!\n Reporting on the feat in 2011, the Daily Mail observed, \"Particularly likely to come under attack from pedantic Joyce fans is his decision to ignore hotels and restaurants which serve drinks and may even have their own bar inside.\" McCann acknowledged in that article that \"It's a contentious issue. . . .

  "060043passover": {
    "note": " In an allusion that can easily be missed in Hades, Bloom imagines that the old woman peering out of her window onto Newbridge Avenue is \"Thanking her stars she was passed over.\" He must be thinking in a wry way of the Passover, because in Aeolus he reflects at length on this Jewish holiday. In a section introduced by the headline \"AND IT WAS THE FEAST OF THE PASSOVER\" (echoing similar phrases in John 2:13, 6:4, 11:55, and 19:14), Bloom recalls the rituals in which his devout father instructed him. His thoughts harmonize with Stephen's fancy of a hangman God, since Passover celebrates the bloody justice of a divine protector who rules over a world of death.",
    "expandedNote": " Passover, or Pesach, is a major Jewish holiday lasting about a week. It commemorates the last of God's ten plagues, the killing of Egypt's firstborn sons, which gave the hard-hearted Pharaoh the final kick he needed to release the children of Israel from their bondage. The Hebrews were told to slaughter a spring lamb and use the blood to mark the entrances to their homes: \"For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you\" (Exodus 12:23, emphasis added). Bloom comically fancies that Paddy Dignam's neighbor has survived such a night of terror, \"Thanking her stars\" that the angel of death went to no. 9 instead of her house.\n The delivery from Egyptian bondage is celebrated in Jewish homes each spring in seder dinners that Bloom thinks of in Aeolus.Watching a typesetter reading text backwards, he remembers his father reading Hebrew right to left in the \"ancient hagadah book\" that Ithaca shows he still owns.Aeolus recalls many details from this book: \"Poor papa with his hagadah book, reading backwards with his finger to me. Pessach. Next year in Jerusalem. Dear, O dear! All that long business about that brought us out of the land of Egypt and into the house of bondage Alleluia. Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu. No, that's the other. Then the twelve brothers, Jacob's sons. And then the lamb and the cat and the dog and the stick and the water and the butcher. And then the angel of death kills the butcher and he kills the ox and the dog kills the cat. Sounds a bit silly till you come to look into it well. Justice it means but it's everybody eating everyone else. That's what life is after all.\"\n The Hebrew word haggadah comes from vehigaadato (\"you shall tell\") in Exodus 13:8: \"And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, This is done because of that which the Lord did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt.\" On the first two evenings of \"Pessach,\" ceremonial Seder meals are held which involve re-telling the old story. \"Next year in Jerusalem\" recalls the closing phrase of the first seder, which comes after a prayer asking God to rebuild the holy city of Jerusalem. As Thornton notes, the participants in the seder exclaim these words \"in expression of their joyous hope of return to the Holy Land.\" \n At three different points in the service, the Haggadah specifies narrating \"that long business about that brought us out of the land of Egypt\"—familiar language from various books of the Hebrew Bible. Perhaps Bloom's memory is failing him when he thinks \"into the house of bondage\" (instead of \"from\"), or perhaps, as Johnson speculates, he may be offering an ironic commentary. He repeats the altered line in Nausicaa. The telling of the exodus story is punctuated several times by the exclamation \"Alleluia\" (from halelu yah in Hebrew, \"Praise Yah,\" i.e. YHWH).\n At \"Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu\" (\"Hear, oh Israel, the Lord our God\"), a slightly shortened version of a Hebrew sentence in Deuteronomy 6:4, Bloom's memory jumps to a different part of his Jewish upbringing. These words open the familiar prayer called the Shema that is recited every morning and evening in the synagogue, and they do not appear in either seder service. Bloom catches himself, thinking, \"No that's the other,\" but there is a reason he thinks of the Shema, because both seders refer to it. \n The twelve tribes of Israel descended from \"the twelve brothers, Jacob's sons\" figure in all the tellings of the Egyptian bondage story, and they are also mentioned in a recitation at the end of the second seder. At this point in his revery Bloom is probably recalling the end of the second service, since he thinks of Jacob's sons in sequence ('Then. . . And then\") with an Aramaic song about household animals that concludes the second service. \n The Chad Gadya (\"One Kid\"), like nursery rhymes such as The House that Jack Built, has verses that repeat earlier verses and add to them. The final verse, which recapitulates all the others, recounts how \"the Most Holy,\" i.e. God, \"destroyed the angel of death that slew the slaughterer that killed the ox that drank the water that quenched the fire that burned the stick that beat the dog that bit the cat that ate the kid that father bought for two zuzim. One kid, one kid.\" \n Bloom reflects that this chant about a series of animals \"Sounds a bit silly till you come to look into it well. Justice it means.\" He is clearly thinking of some allegorical interpretation, and Thornton quotes from the Jewish Encyclopedia to the effect that the chant \"was for a long time regarded as an allegorical version of the principle of 'jus talionis,'\" the eye-for-an-eye justice articulated in Exodus 21:24-25. \n There are other allegorical readings of the song. Gifford cites a gloss in Abraham Regelson's The Haggadah of Passover, A Faithful English Rendering (1944): \"Chad Gadya (One Kid), in outward seeming a childish lilt, has been interpreted as the history of successive empires that devastate and swallow one another (Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Persia, etc.). The kid, bottommost and most injured of all, is, of course, the people of Israel. The killing of the Angel of Death marks the day when the kingdom of the Almighty will be established on earth; then, too, Israel will live in perfect redemption in the promised land\" (63). This interpretation expresses Jews' millennial endurance in the face of persecution and exile, a value asserted by the entireHaggadah. Bloom clearly shares this value, but as Slote observes, he omits the part of the song about God killing the Angel of Death, leaving that ominous allegorical figure victorious. It seems very unlikely that he is thinking of a Zionist homecoming at this moment.\n Bloom states quite clearly what he is thinking about. In his simple and decidedly unorthodox view, scholars may say that the meaning of the ditty is justice, \"but it's everybody eating everyone else. That's what life is after all.\" Bloom often finds adult realities encoded in silly-sounding children's stories. Here in Aeolus his thought bridges the gap between his meditations on death in Hades (ineluctable, meaningless, vast) and his thoughts about eating in Lestrygonians (a daily necessity that involves killing other living things). An endless cycle of killing and eating: that's what life is, after all."

    "expandedNote": " \"Windmill Lane\" opens off the quay to the right, travels a single city block, turns right, and dead-ends at Creighton Street, forming a short \"L.\" Today it is famous as the site of U2's former recording studio. Just past it Bloom sees the shopfront of \"Leask's,\" which Gifford, readingThom's, identifies as \"H. M. Leask & Co., linseed crushers, oil and linseed cake manufacturers, 14-15 Rogerson's Quay.\" The business is long gone, but the brick structure built in the 1890s remains, with the name of another business, Columbia Mills, visible at the top. It is the only building from Joyce's era remaining on Sir John Rogerson's Quay. In recent decades it too has become known for music. It appears in The Commitments (1991), because the band played one of its final concerts in the bar that then occupied the building. It was also once partially occupied by Clannad Music.\n 19 Rogerson's Quay held \"the sailors' home,\" officially the Shipwrecked Mariners' Society. Between Leask's and the old salts' home lay \"the postal telegraph office,\" officially the Town Sub-Post Office, Savings Bank, and Money Order Office, at 18 Rogerson's Quay. Bloom reflects that he could have used this post office as a poste restante blind in addition to the one in Westland Row toward which he is circling.\" Unlike his wife, he is quite surreptitious about his adulterous correspondence."

    "note": " Turning from Patrice Egan to himself, Stephen lapses into more French as he thinks of what a sorry figure he cut in his Paris days. This note translates the French phrases from the three paragraphs of text that culminate in his return to Dublin via Newhaven, England.",
    "expandedNote": " \"You were a student, weren't you? Of what in the other devil's name? Paysayenn. P. C. N., you know: physiques, chimiques et naturelles.\" (Physics, chemistry, and biology.) Stephen pronounces the initials as the French do, thinking wryly of his pretense of being a premedical student. Like Stephen, Joyce dabbled halfheartedly in these studies for a time. Ellmann comments, \"Paris was Dublin's antithesis. The daydream of himself as Dr. Joyce, poet, epiphanist, and physician, surrounded by fair women, was not at all dampened by the small amount of money beyond his fare that his father could give him . . .\" (111). In December 1902 \"he prevailed upon Dr. Paul Brouardel, dean of the faculty at the École de Médecine, to grant him a provisional card of admission to the course for the certificate in physics, chemistry, and biology\" (113). In actuality Stephen led a most unglamorous life in those days, \"Eating your groatsworth of mou en civet, fleshpots of Egypt, elbowed by belching cabmen.\" Gifford identifies mou en civet as \"a stew made of lungs, the cheapest of restaurant dishes.\" The \"belching cabmen\" jammed in beside Stephen on a cheap bench complete the picture.\n Despite the dismal circumstances and the silly pretentions, Stephen has supposed that the glamor of the great city will rub off on him. He imagines alluding to it after he leaves, to impress people: \"Just say in the most natural tone: when I was in Paris, boul' Mich', I used to.\" The Boulevard Saint-Michel, Gifford notes, is \"a street on the left bank of the Seine in Paris and the café center of student and bohemian life at the turn of the century.\" He quotes Arthur Symons' The Decadent Movement in Literature (1893) on the \"noisy, brainsick young people who haunt the brasseries of the Boulevard Saint-Michel and exhaust their ingenuities in theorizing over the works they cannot write.\" Stephen is purportedly so intimate an inhabitant of this hip scene that he abbreviates the name in the most \"natural\" way. \n Recollections of his pretentiousness give way to other kinds of silliness. Fantasizing that some doppelgänger of his would commit a crime and he would be charged for it, Stephen prepared alibis in advance: \"Yes, used to carry punched tickets to prove an alibi if they arrested you for murder somewhere. Justice. On the night of the seventeenth of February 1904 the prisoner was seen by two witnesses. Other fellow did it: other me. Hat, tie, overcoat, nose. Lui, c'est moi.\" The French phrase (I am he) parodies Louis XIV's famous saying L'état, c'est moi\" (I am the state). From here, Stephen transits to a time when he wanted to commit murder. Desperate with hunger, rushing to the post office to cash his mother's money order for eight shillings, he found the door slammed in his face by the usher and protested: \"Encore deux minutes. Look clock. Must get. Fermé. Hired dog!\" He gestured for the doorman to look at the clock and see that there were \"still two minutes\" to go till closing time, but the post office was definitively \"closed.\" \n The jagged, ungrammatical fragments he recalls speaking in his own language (\"Look clock\", \"Must get\") seem to be examples of \"Pretending to speak broken English,\" which he mentions in the next paragraph in connection with returning to Ireland by way of England. Coming back from his continental adventure to \"the slimy pier at Newhaven,\" the cosmopolitan Stephen is so pretentious (I'm really very français,don't you know?) that he affects not to understand something said to him in his own language: \"Comment?\" (What?). But all he really has to show for his misspent voyage are \"Le Tutu, five tattered numbers of Pantalon Blanc et Culotte Rouge,\" and a French telegram from his father, announcing that his mother is dying and he must come home."

  "030038pebbles": {
    "note": " As Stephen walks across the \"damp crackling mast, razorshells, squeaking pebbles\" in Proteus, an inexactly remembered line of Shakespeare's verse drifts into his mind: \"that on the unnumbered pebbles beats.\" This detail from King Lear insinuates an association of \"pebbles\" with danger and death that recurs several times in the novel.",
    "expandedNote": " According to the OED, \"mast\" can be a collective name for the nuts of various forest trees, especially when used as food for pigs. Stephen may possibly be thinking of various kinds of vegetable matter that have been ground up to make the beach, along with seashells, bits of rock, and wood from wrecked ships.\n In King Lear 4.6, the blinded and despairing Gloucester wants to commit suicide by jumping from the cliffs of Dover. His son Edgar, in disguise, tricks the old man into believing that he is standing on the top of a cliff, far above the beach:\n The fishermen that walk upon the beach\n Appear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark,\n Diminished to her cock; her cock, a buoy\n Almost too small for sight. The murmuring surge,\n That on th' unnumb'red idle pebble chafes,\n Cannot be heard so high. \n Gloucester throws himself off what he believes to be a cliff, but instead of plummeting through air and smashing against the pebbles far below, the audience sees him merely topple forward onto his face. \n Stephen seems to be merely recalling a line of iambic pentameter with pebbles in it, rather than meditating on the action of the play. But pebbles do return several times in the novel in ways that suggest the author may be thinking about the scene, and about Gloucester's brush with death.\n In Lestrygonians Bloom recalls lying high on Howth Head with Molly and hearing pebbles roll off the cliff to the sea below: \"Flowers her eyes were, take me, willing eyes. Pebbles fell. She lay still. A goat. No-one. High on Ben Howth rhododendrons a nannygoat walking surefooted, dropping currants.\" Later, in Nausicaa, he is sitting on the same beach that Stephen has walked on and thinks about the impossibility of numbering pebbles: \"All those holes and pebbles. Who could count them?\"\n In Hades pebbles are associated with an old grey rat that lives on intimate terms with the dead: \"Rtststr! A rattle of pebbles. Wait. Stop! . . . An obese grey rat toddled along the side of the crypt, moving the pebbles. An old stager: greatgrandfather: he knows the ropes. The grey alive crushed itself in under the plinth, wriggled itself in under it.\" And in Circe Paddy Dignam, the man who has died, joins the rat in rattling the pebbles: \"He worms down through a coalhole, his brown habit trailing its tether over rattling pebbles.\""

  "130006phantomship": {
    "note": " Ghostly ships play a role in Ulysses through allusions to the wildly fanciful tales of two musical versions of The Flying Dutchman, but they are also seen through the skeptical lens of Bloom's amateur science. Near the end of Nausicaa, as he lies looking out toward Howth with darkness coming on, a strange shape appears in the sky: \"Were those nightclouds there all the time? Looks like a phantom ship. No. Wait. Trees are they? An optical illusion. Mirage.\" If the amorphous shape he is trying to make out in the evening sky is a ship, Bloom knows enough to explain the seemingly supernatural vision as a known scientific phenomenon.",
    "expandedNote": " The optical illusions known as \"superior mirages\" are seen most often in the Arctic, but in cold waters like those around Ireland they can occur under just the right conditions, when a temperature inversion traps colder air along the sea's surface under a blanket of warmer air. The greater refractive index of the cold air bends light downwards, making a ship appear higher than it really is. The image can appear either right-side up or upside down. Such images are usually more stable than \"inferior mirages,\" which are caused by a layer of hot summer air lying close to the ground: those tend to shimmer, vibrate, and lengthen vertically or horizontally.\n By the end of the 19th century seamen's tales of ghost ships were being countered with this scientific understanding. In \"When We Must Not Believe Our Eyes,\" a chapter in Frank R. Stockton's Round-about Rambles in Lands of Fact and Fancy (1910), the author assures his young readers that many scary things which our eyes tell us are true are in fact not real. He describes an incident when \"awe-stricken sailors saw a large ship, with all sails set, gliding over what seemed to be a placid ocean, for beneath the ship was the reflection of it.The news soon spread through the vessel that a phantom-ship with a ghostly crew was sailing in the air over a phantom-ocean, and that it was a bad omen, and meant that not one of them should ever see land again.\" \n The captain, who knows how disjunct layers of air can produce optical illusions, tells his men that \"this strange appearance was caused by the reflection of some ship that was sailing on the water below this image, but at such a distance they could not see it. There were certain conditions of the atmosphere, he said, when the sun's rays could form a perfect picture in the air of objects on the earth, like the images one sees in glass or water, but they were not generally upright, as in the case of this ship, but reversed—turned bottom upwards. This appearance in the air is called a mirage.\" Directed by the captain to climb to the foretop, one of the sailors reports that \"he could see on the water, below the ship in the air, one precisely like it. Just then another ship was seen in the air, only this one was a steamship, and was bottom-upwards, as the captain had said these mirages generally appeared. Soon after, the steamship itself came in sight. The sailors were now convinced, and never afterwards believed in phantom-ships\" (277-79)."

  "040034photobits": {
    "note": " Unlike the more suggestively named Tit-Bits (another weekly selling for one penny), \"Photo Bits\" was, by Victorian and Georgian standards, a softcore pornography publication. It offered \"Thirty-Two Pages of Pictures,\" many of them prurient, and it was the first magazine in the UK to offer pin-up photos, which is how Bloom obtained \"The Bath of the Nymph over the bed. Given away with the Easter number of Photo Bits.\" After many decades of searching, no scholar has succeeded in locating this \"Splendid masterpiece in art colours,\" so the image may very well be fictional, generated by Joyce's desire to associate Molly with the nymph Calypso.",
    "expandedNote": " In addition to many photographs, Photo Bits featured short stories and bits of comic whimsy (as did Tit-Bits), and drawings of theater girls (some of them naked). The captions below the accompanying images from a 1902 issue give a sense of the pornographic spirit of the magazine, urgent but comical, and constrained by contemporary mores of clothing, marriage, and public display. Below the cover image of a man kissing and not yet fondling a very compliant woman, there is some text beneath the title \"LOVE'S ANXIETY.\" She says, \"Kiss me again.\" He protests, \"My dear, I’ve just kissed you seventeen times in seventeen seconds.\" She replies, \"(reproachfully) – Harold, you love another!\" \n With its male readership thus assured that female desire is just as pressing as their own, the issue offers a pin-up page displaying two fully clothed but unmistakably inviting women gazing into the viewer's eyes. The text below the reclining one, titled \"SWEETS ON A SHELF,\" teasingly notes, \"which any well-endowed viscount (K of K not excepted) can enjoy with the assistance of a wedding-ring and a brief but dignified ceremony at St George’s, Hanover Square.\" (Anthony Quinn, who displays the image on a weblog page, notes, \"Quite why K of K – Lord Kitchener of Khartoum – is referred to is unclear.\")\n The lower image shows an attractive female scandalously and quite happily kicking up a leg to reveal the frilly undergarments beneath her high-hemmed beachgoing dress. Under the title \"ON BLACKPOOL'S SANDY BEACH,\" the text reads, \"A delightful memory of a week at the delightful Lancashire watering-place.\" Like the photos and cartoons in Playboy in the 1960s, this image invites the reader to imagine the adventures that certain luckier men are enjoying. In Penelope Molly appears to express an impatience similar to what a wife in the 60s would have felt if her husband had left copies of Playboy lying around: \"Im glad I burned the half of those old Freemans and Photo Bits leaving things like that lying about hes getting very careless.\"\n Circe calls exaggerated attention to the mongrel mix of ads that crowded most pages of the magazine, pin-up centerfolds excepted. Gifford gives some examples: \"everything from 'Aristotle's Works' to 'Flagellations and Flagellants,' 'Rare Books and Curious Photographs,' 'Rose's Famous Female Mixture . . will Positively Remove the most Obstinate Obstructions,' 'Bile Beans For Biliousness,' and innnumerable books and pills that promised 'Manhood Restored.'\" When the Nymph first accosts Bloom in Circe—\"Mortal! You found me in evil company\"—she evokes the assortment of stories and ads in the magazine: \"I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen, stories to disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice and bustpads, proprietary articles and why wear a truss with testimonial from ruptured gentleman. Useful hints to the married. . . . Rubber goods. Neverrip brand as supplied to the aristocracy. Corsets for men. I cure fits or money refunded. Unsolicited testimonials for Professor Waldmann's wonderful chest exuber. My bust developed four inches in three weeks, reports Mrs Gus Rublin with photo.\" Bloom timidly asks, \"You mean Photo Bits?\" The Nymph replies, \"I do.\" \n From its beginning in 1898, Photo Bits was in the sights of the British social organizations that sought to root out pornography and other forms of indecency. In James Joyce, Sexuality, and Social Purity (Cambridge UP, 2003), Katherine Mullin notes that after it was renamed Bits of Fun and came out with \"a particularly racy number,\" the magazine's editor was prosecuted and fined (172n). Joyce, who was tormented by the same enforcers of \"purity\" throughout his attempts to publish Dubliners, A Portrait of the Artist, and Ulysses, may very well have included Photo Bits in his big novel from a sense of solidarity with the publishers, no matter how trashy their product."

  "010127photogirl": {
    "note": " The young swimmer in Telemachus tells Mulligan that their mutual friend Alec Bannon has written him a postcard which mentions that he has met a “Photo girl” in Westmeath, and Mulligan takes the young woman's employment as an occasion for ribald joking: “Snapshot, eh? Brief exposure.” It will turn out that the girl is Bloom's daughter Milly, and that she merely works in a photographer's shop. But there were multiple reasons at the turn of the century to associate the relatively new art of photography with sexually alluring young women.",
    "expandedNote": " Throughout the novel, the absent person of the fifteen-year-old Milly Bloom is charged with sexual interest and anxiety. Her pubescent blooming has caused considerable tension within the Bloom household, and the letter that her father receives from her in Calypso, which mentions Bannon, fills him with worry that she may become sexually active. The young men of the novel certainly view her in that light. In Oxen of the Sun, in another gathering of raucous twenty-somethings that includes Bannon and Mulligan, we hear her referred to as a \"Bold bad girl from the town of Mullingar.\"\n In an essay titled \"Joyce, Early Cinema and the Erotics of Everyday Life,\" published in Roll Away the Reel World: James Joyce and Cinema, ed. John McCourt (Cork University Press, 2010), Katherine Mullin provides a contemporary context for the young men's assumption that a \"photo girl\" might be a girl of easy virtue: \"This easy innuendo attests to the equivocal nature of Milly's voguish career. 'Photo girls' were often employed as lab assistants and colourists, but as attractive young women fronting photography booths and studios, they were also hired to drum up trade, especially in tourist resorts like Mullingar\" (51-52).\n Mullin adds that the erotic reputation of these \"photo girls\" was enhanced by the advertising posters featuring Kodak Girls that were common in the United Kingdom in the early 20th century: \"They were quickly established as fin de siècle sex symbols, a status crystallised in the Eastman Kodak advertisements launched in 1893 and enduring into the mid-1920s. 'Kodak Girls', who brandished cameras in their distinctive blue and white striped costumes and daringly shortened skirts, were flirtatious, adventurous and spirited heroines of modern life, and Milly shares both their youthful sexuality and their promotional function. Milly's awareness of her ambiguous role is implied in her letter, which moves from her claim to be 'getting on swimming in the photo business now' to an allusion to Blazes [sic] Boylan's 'song about those seaside girls'\" (52). The song is about well-dressed, erotically captivating women at the seashore—and some of the Kodak posters, like the one reproduced here, in fact showed their girls on the beach.\n In addition to these soft uses of sex to sell photographic products and services, there was a burgeoning pornography industry. Almost from its inception, the art of photography had been turned to prurient uses. In later Victorian times and the Edwardian decade (1901-10), the market was flooded with naughty picture postcards, ranging from titillating shots of scantily clad young women to graphic depictions of intercourse. Bloom knows these lewd postcards well. In Circe, the honorable Mrs. Mervyn Talboys accuses him of having \"sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. I have it still. It represents a partially nude señorita, frail and lovely (his wife, as he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. He urged me to do likewise.\"\n The \"nude señorita\" comes from Bloom's knowledge of what resides in his desk drawer: a photograph of a young Spanish woman performing fellatio on a bullfighter. Ithaca reveals that he owns \"2 erotic postcards showing a) buccal coition between nude senorita (rere presentation, superior position) and nude torero (fore presentation, inferior position) b) anal violation by male religious (fully clothed, eyes abject) of female religious (partly clothed, eyes direct), purchased by post from Box 32, P.O., Charing Cross, London, W.C.\" The photograph of a monk having anal intercourse with a nun comes up again in Penelope, when Molly imagines a sister coming to the house to take care of a sick Bloom: \"like the smutty photo he has shes as much a nun as Im not.\"\n The references to Paris and London in connection with erotic photos indicate that the pornography industry has yet not made its way to puritanical Ireland. As Stephen says in Scylla and Charybdis, “Elizabethan London lay as far from Stratford as corrupt Paris lies from virgin Dublin.” But Dublin men are certainly making their way to it. \n [2013] Ulysses also explores the erotic potential of the mutoscope, a device that enabled individual users to view an early form of motion pictures. In Circe this device supplies the inspiration for Bloom to gaze through a keyhole at his wife having intercourse with Blazes Boylan."

  "030132pickmeup": {
    "note": " When Stephen thinks, \"Talk that to someone else, Stevie: a pickmeup,\" he is clearly talking himself out of his interest in the girl at the Hodges Figgis' window, in the same way that he has urged himself earlier in Proteus to be more financially prudent (\"go easy with that money like a good young imbecile\"), or to give up his fascination with obscure medieval texts (\"Come out of them, Stephen. Beauty is not there\"), or to get over his religious piety (\"Cousin Stephen, you will never be a saint\"), or to stop lusting after women in the street (\"Sell your soul for that, do, dyed rags pinned round a squaw\"). But why does he call himself Stevie? And what is a pickmeup? The sentence seems to recall a conversation that Stephen had with his friend Davin in the last chapter of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.",
    "expandedNote": " The nickname Stevie appears nowhere else in Ulysses, but Joyce had used it in earlier fictions. In Stephen Hero Stephen is addressed that way several times by his university companion Madden, a young man from Limerick: \"—You know, Stevie, he said (Madden had a brother Stephen and he sometimes used this familiar form) you always told me I was a country buachail and I can't understand you mystical fellows.\" In A Portrait Stephen acquires another university companion named Davin, from the countryside south of Limerick. Davin appears to be a reincarnation of Madden based on his intense Irish nationalism, his unassuming country folksiness, and his use of the nickname Stevie: \"—A thing happened to myself, Stevie, last autumn, coming on winter, and I never told it to a living soul and you are the first person now I ever told it to. I disremember if it was October or November. It was October because it was before I came up here to join the matriculation class.\"\n This \"thing\" was an attempted seduction. Davin was late leaving a hurling match in the town of Buttevant, missed the train home, and began walking back along a very dark country road. When he saw a cottage with a light in the window, he knocked on the door and asked the woman inside for a glass of water. She gave him milk and, \"half undressed,\" implicitly offered herself to him as well, saying that her husband was away: \"And all the time she was talking, Stevie, she had her eyes fixed on my face and she stood so close to me I could hear her breathing. When I handed her back the mug at last she took my hand to draw me in over the threshold and said: Come in and stay the night here. You've no call to be frightened. There's no one in it but ourselves. . . . I didn't go in, Stevie. I thanked her and went on my way again, all in a fever. At the first bend of the road I looked back and she was standing at the door.\"\n So it seems that in Proteus Stephen is channeling the chaste Davin, imagining his friend saying to him, \"Don't go there, Stevie. It would just be a one-night stand.\" I have not found documentation for this use of \"pickmeup,\" however."

  "030111pico": {
    "note": " Ruthlessly skewering himself, Stephen imagines his writings being rediscovered \"after a few thousand years, a mahamanvantara. Pico della Mirandola like.\" The thought seems to have been prompted by reading Walter Pater's late 19th century essay on the Italian Renaissance wunderkind philosopher Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (1463-94), an essay which helped to revive interest in Pico's writings. Pater's prose probably lies behind Stephen's mocking language: \"When one reads these strange pages of one long gone one feels that one is at one with one who once...\" The general idea, augmented by the Hindu concept of the mahamanvantara (a very, very, very long period of time), is that people in the distant future will recognize the genius of a writer who went unappreciated in the early 20th century.",
    "expandedNote": " Pico was a humanist scholar with command of four ancient languages (Greek, Latin, Hebrew, Arabic) and at least some facility in others (Aramaic, Persian). He set out to recover all sorts of ancient wisdom traditions, syncretically harmonizing them with Christianity as inflected by the Aristotelianism of the Scholastics and the Platonism of 15th century Florence. Instead of the triumphant reception he sought by defending his 900 Theses against all comers in Rome, his teachings were condemned by the pope, his books were burned, and he lived with perpetual threats to his freedom and life from the Inquisition. He suffered near-total obscurity until the last years of the 19th century. \n It is easy to imagine Stephen identifying with this multilingual reader of arcane texts. Pico aspired to transform European civilization by revealing a radically new but timeless theology, and he wanted to be recognized as a genius, like Stephen \"stepping forward to applause earnestly, striking face.\" Gifford quotes from the biography written by his nephew Giovanni Francesco Pico, which was translated into English in 1890: Pico was \"full of pryde and desyrous of glory and mannes prayse.\" He did not receive such praise until four centuries later, when a Victorian Aesthete approached his writings with the breathless awe of an amateur archaeologist entering a pharaonic tomb. \n Studies in the History of the Renaissance (1873), by the Oxford don Walter Pater, approaches prominent artists and thinkers of the early modern era (Pico, Botticelli, Leonardo, Michelangelo, and others) through irreducibly particular aesthetic responses to qualities like \"beauty,\" \"pleasure,\" \"charm,\" \"strangeness,\" \"passion,\" \"insight,\" and \"excitement.\" The essays in Pater's book seek to capture the exquisite achievements of a bygone era not through rigorous historical recovery of past intellectual practices but through passionate responses in the present. \n Thornton quotes a sentence from the essay on Pico that illustrates Pater's approach: \"He will not let one go; he wins one on, in spite of oneself, to turn the pages of his forgotten books.\" Gifford quotes two others: \"And yet to read a page of one of Pico's forgotten books is like a glance into one of those ancient sepulchres, upon which the wanderer in classical lands has sometimes stumbled, with the old disused ornaments and furniture of a world wholly unlike ours still fresh in them,\" and \"Above all, we have a constant sense in reading him . . . a glow and vehemence in his words which remind one of the manner in which his own brief existence flamed itself away.\" The frequent use of this word appears to have given Joyce the handle he needed to mock the idea of lost genius being rediscovered many centuries later.\n The \"mahamanvantara,\" which Stephen probably encountered in Helena Blavatsky's Key to Theosophy (1890 ed.), is a Sanskrit word meaning \"great year.\" It apparently can be reckoned in various ways, but it invariably totals billions or even trillions of years. It signifies a time of cosmic activity, following a mahapralaya or great period of cosmic downtime. In \"The Holy Office\" Joyce wrote that he would not make his peace with his contemporary Irish writers \"Till the Mahamanvantara be done.\" \n Proteus redirects the barb of this extravagant thinking to mock the pretensions of the solitary genius. Stephen's hyperbolic estimation of the time his works will lie unread is of a piece with his fantasy of sending copies to \"all the great libraries of the world, including Alexandria.\""

  "030004pigeonhouse": {
    "note": " Much of Proteus takes place near \"the south wall,\" one of two great seawalls that funnel the River Liffey into Dublin Bay through an area known by the name of Poolbeg. Partway along this wall sits an old hotel known as \"the Pigeonhouse.\"",
    "expandedNote": " After walking along the Sandymount strand (the section of beach east of the suburb of Sandymount), Stephen turns first northeast toward the wall, and then east along it, walking beside its great \"boulders\" which he imagines as \"piled stone mammoth skulls.\" Finding himself \"nearer the edge of the sea\" to the east, he decides that he has gone far enough and retraces his steps: \"He lifted his feet up from the suck and turned back by the mole of boulders.\" One meaning of \"mole,\" according to the OED, is \"A massive structure, esp. of stone, serving as a pier or breakwater, or as a junction between two places separated by from each other by water.\" \n Stephen's jaunt will conclude by watching the incoming tide from the rocks, climbing onto the wall, continuing west on the road that runs atop it, and walking back to solid land dry and safe: \"The flood is following me. I can watch it flow past from here. Get back then by the Poolbeg road to the strand there.\" \n Dublin's Great South Wall or South Bull Wall (\"bull\" is a synonym for strand or beach) was constructed of wood pilings and gravel in the early 18th century, and reinforced with huge granite blocks (quarried in Dalkey, and floated in by barges) in the second half of the century. At the time of its construction it was the longest seawall in the world. The purpose was to protect ships from violent weather, which often wrecked vessels in the sands of the estuary and which, even when not so disastrous, could delay entry into Dublin for weeks. \n A second seawall, the North Bull Wall, was built in the first half of the 19th century to solve the problem of silting at the mouth of the Liffey. Together with the south wall, which it angled down to nearly meet, it effectively scoured away silt and sand, deepening the river channel and allowing ships to proceed farther upstream. (Similar long seawalls were built south of New Orleans to propel the massive loads of silt in the Mississippi River far out into the Gulf of Mexico.)\n At the end of Finnegans Wake, as Anna Livia drifts out to sea, she thinks of passing the juncture where the two long arms of seawall come nearly together: \"sad and weary I go back to you, my cold father, my cold mad father, my cold mad feary father, till the near sight of the mere size of him, the moyles and moyles of it, moananoaning, makes me seasilt saltsick and I rush, my only, into your arms. I see them rising! Save me from those therrble prongs!\" The 1902 map here illustrates how the two prongs come together to force the river's water out into the cold miles of open ocean.\n Other features of the south wall figure in Ulysses. After construction of the wall was complete, a lighthouse was built at its far end. This lighthouse, painted a distinctive bright red, is mentioned in the novel as \"the Poolbeg light.\" During the construction of the wall, a storehouse for materials was built on land created about halfway along its length. When the wall was finished, the caretaker who lived in this building, John Pidgeon, converted it into a tavern and later a hotel, to cater to sailors and travelers arriving in Dublin from long sea voyages. It became known as \"the Pigeonhouse,\" and although the name has nothing to do with birds, it sets Stephen's mind tumbling through thoughts of pigeons and wild geese.\n In 1798, fearing French invasion, the government took possession of the Pigeon House, turned the hotel into officers' quarters, and built a barracks and fortifications. In the 1866 print here, the distinctive shape of the Pigeon House can be seen to the left of the huge hulking fortifications. In 1897 the Dublin Corporation bought the land and buildings, demolished the fort, and constructed a coal-fired electricity generating station, which began producing power in 1903. That power plant was decommissioned in the early 1970s, replaced by a pair of much smaller smokestacks with red and white stripes at the top which can be seen in the largest of the photographs.\n In the Dubliners story called \"An Encounter,\" three boys plan a day of \"miching,\" or truancy from school. \"We arranged to go along the Wharf Road until we came to the ships, then to cross in the ferryboat and walk out to see the Pigeon House.\" They never get that far.\n At the end of Cyclops, Bloom's departure from Barney Kiernan's pub is imagined as a maritime launch: \"the mastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final floral tribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were present in large numbers while, as it proceeded down the river, escorted by a flotilla of barges, the flags of the Ballast office and Custom House were dipped in salute as were also those of the electrical power station at the Pigeonhouse and the Poolbeg Light.\""

    "note": " As the self-appointed embodiment of Irish nationalism in the bar, and as someone associated with the Gaelic League, the Citizen voices contempt for Irishmen \"that can't speak their own language.\" He regularly sprinkles Irish words and short phrases into his speech: \"a chara,\" \"Bi i dho husht,\" \"Sinn Fein!...Sinn Fein amhain!,\" \"Slan leat,\" \"Na bacleis,\" \"pishogue,\" \"Raimeis.\" But many of these expressions were commonplace in Hiberno-English speech, and two of them mean something other than the Citizen seems to suppose. Like the narrator of Eumaeus, who regularly tosses out italicized French and Latin words in order to appear cultivated—and as a result sounds pretentious—the Citizen shows off a bilingual facility that is more broad than deep. In this as in many other ways, he is full of hot air.",
    "expandedNote": " Some of the Citizen's Irishisms are colloquial enough. When his dog starts growling he says, \"Bi i dho husht\" (Bi i do thost), or \"Be quiet!\" When Joe Hynes asks about his health he replies, \"Never better, a chara\"—\"my friend.\" He repeats the phrase later when Hynes offers him a drink: \"I will, says he, a chara, to show there's no ill feeling.\" Later, Hynes compliments him on being the man who \"made the Gaelic sports revival\" and who set records in the shot put, prompting him to say, \"Na bacleis\" (ná bac leis), or \"Don't bother about it.\" When Bloom boldly challenges his bigotry he says, \"Raimeis\" (ráiméis), \"Nonsense!\" or \"Foolish talk!\" \n The last two of these words, however, had long entered into Anglophone speech, in forms like \"nabocklesh\" and \"rawmaish.\" Dolan includes both in his Dictionary of Hiberno-English. Among uses of the latter he cites this: \"Don't be talking raumaish; I know exactly what happened.\" Not only had Anglicized versions ofráiméis long been staples of Hiberno-English, but that word was also circulating prominently in print journalism at the turn of the century. Citing F. S. Lyons' Culture and Anarchy in Ireland 1890-1939 (Oxford, 1979), Gifford observes that it \"was made into a household word for cant by D. P. Moran in The Leader,\" a Dublin newspaper established in 1900. Moran used it for the widespread \"pretense and humbug\" which he was fighting. The Citizen, then, could be drawing on a well-known staple of the English of his city rather than on extensive knowledge of the Irish language. \n The same can be said of \"Sinn Fein!...Sinn fein amhain!\" (sinn féin amháin). The meaning is \"Ourselves! Ourselves alone!\"—i.e., Ireland for the Irish, without the English stranger. But, as Gifford notes, this was a common patriotic toast and the motto of the Gaelic League. It was also the refrain in a famous song titled The West's Awake, about the movement to \"wake the old tongue of the Gael; / The speech our fathers loved of yore.\" The Irish language, according to the song, was made \"weak and low, / O'ermastered by its foreign foe.\" But now \"We've won the fight; Sinn Fein Amhain!\" and people can see \"How strong and great 'tis bound to be!\" Well, perhaps. The song itself is written in English, and the Citizen need only have listened to it, or hoisted a few glasses with his Gaelic League friends, to learn the Irish phrase. \n The outright misunderstandings of Irish begin when Joe Hynes hands around some pints and the Citizen says, \"Slan leat\"(slán leat), literally \"safe with you.\" This Irish way of saying \"goodbye\" to someone who is leaving (slán agat is used when the speaker is leaving) would be wildly inappropriate as a response to someone who just bought you a drink. A far more fitting reply would be \"Go raibh maith agat,\" or \"Thank you.\"\n Another dubious use of Irish comes when the Citizen, warming up for his assault on Bloom, unleashes a string of invectives against Josie Breen's husband, who is not in the bar. The intention behind the first two seems clear enough: \"a half and half\" and \"A fellow that's neither fish nor flesh\" imply that Dennis Breen is somehow deficient in manhood, despite his bevy of children. Similar charges are later made more explicitly about Bloom when he steps out of the bar: \"— Do you call that a man? says the citizen. / — I wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says Joe. / — Well, there were two children born anyhow, says Jack Power. / — And who does he suspect? says the citizen. / Gob, there's many a true word spoken in jest. One of those mixed middlings he is.\"\n But, not content with \"half and half,\" the talkative bigot cannot resist showing off his knowledge of the native vernacular: \"A pishogue, if you know what that is.\" Not only was this word well known to people who did not speak any Irish (hence the lack of italics), but the Citizen himself seems not to know what it is. Pishogue or pishrogue (Hiberno-English equivalents of the Irish piseog or pisreog) was a peasant superstition about witchcraft. It usually meant a charm or spell, but it was sometimes applied to the people (typically old women) who cast the spells, or to the mistaken belief in such witchcraft, in a sense synomous with \"an old wives' tale.\" One of Dolan's citations notes that country people often invoked the idea to explain shortages of butter in their churns: a neighbor must have cast a pishogue to steal the good stuff. \n None of this appears relevant to the Citizen's desire to asperse Breen's manhood, though Gifford tries to link them, speculating that the word might refer to \"one who is bewitched.\" Declan Kiberd too argues that \"pishogue\" could mean \"by extension, a man 'away' with the fairies.\" But the word was seldom if ever applied to people being hexed, and there are no accounts of pishogue spells having been used to impair virility.\n It seems much more likely, as Paul O. Mahoney notes in \"The Use of 'Pishogue' in Ulysses: One of Joyce's Many Mistakes?,\" JJQ 47.3 (2010): 383-93, that the Citizen is thinking of another word, piteog, that looks like piseog and sounds almost identical (pit-YOHG) but means something very different. Dolan defines it as \"an effeminate man or boy, a sissy; a weedy, insignificant man,\" as in: \"That piteog's always using after-shave or perfume or something.\" This word is more purely Irish. A native Gaelic speaker might use it if he did not know English words for unmanly men, but it is not a staple of Hiberno-English speech. Perhaps the Citizen has heard it in someone's mouth and confused it with the more familiar \"pishogue.\"\n Mahony remarks on the word's broad range of potential applications: \"It typically describes someone who is remarkably unmanly in any way; it can cover homosexuality, sexual deviancy, or simply a particularly odd quality or quirk of character. In some instances, it preserves the ambiguity, increasingly obsolete in English, of the word 'queer'. In most contexts, lighter terms of disparagement such as 'nonce' or 'nancy-boy' would approximate, but not quite translate, its meaning....A piteog could be a lad who shies out of tackles during football training or a man in a mackintosh hanging around a schoolyard\" (385). Mahoney observes that this constellation of qualities seems well suited to Dubliners' dislike of Bloom, who is suspected not only of sexual inadequacy but also of other kinds of untrustworthiness.\n The sexual implications predominate in Cyclops, and they return in Circe when \"pishogue\" is once again used in a context where piteog would be more appropriate. Just before Boylan invites Bloom to look through the keyhole and masturbate while he fucks his wife, Molly uses the word to demean her spouse: \"Let him look, the pishogue! Pimp!\" But if the implications of the one word are being mistakenly mapped onto the other, the question arises, who is making the mistake? The repetition of the error in a second character's mouth would suggest that the defective knowledge of Irish may be Joyce's, not the Citizen's. Mahoney tentatively endorses this reading: \"Inasmuch as Joyce's usage is a continuing puzzle, the best explanation may be that he simply made a mistake\" (389). \n This could well be so—not even James Joyce is perfect—but a strong case can be made for the contrary view. Molly's mistaken \"pishogue\" may simply echo the Citizen's language, since on every page Circe voraciously recycles the words and phrases of earlier chapters. It makes sense that she would do this in the very moment when her emasculating humiliation of Bloom confirms the Citizen's view of him as unmanly.\n It is also plausible to suppose that Joyce could have known both words. Piteog hails from Galway, so he might have learned it from Nora, and his knowledge of Irish has consistently been underestimated. As Brendan O'Hehir writes at the beginning of his preface to A Gaelic Lexicon for Finnegans Wake (1967), \"the undesigned revelations of Stanislaus Joyce have shown that his brother left Ireland with a better initial knowledge of the language of his ancestors than anyone had previously supposed. The Irish lessons James Joyce submitted to, for instance, lasted sporadically for about two years rather than the single session Stephen Dedalus undertook: with Joyce's linguistic flair even a desultory attention for so long would have given him at least a modest competence in Irish.\"\n Assuming that Joyce had sufficient knowledge of Irish, it would be very like him to skewer a character by making him get just one letter wrong and then say, \"A pishogue, if you know what that is.\" And it would cohere with his skepticism about the Gaelic League project of promoting the revival of Irish. In Telemachus Haines, an Englishman, speaks Irish to a peasant woman who should understand him, according to Celtic Revival mythology, but who instead says, \"Is it French you are talking, sir?\" In Cyclops the Citizen reaches for an Irish expression to express his contempt for unmanly men and instead evokes a peasant superstition about stolen butter. His blunder, if such it is, suggests that he speaks Irish very poorly, and also that linguistic traditions smashed by the imperial steamroller are as difficult to recover as peasant folklore swamped by urban modernity.\n Many thanks to Vincent Altman O'Connor for his helpful suggestions about the Citizen's misunderstandings of slán leat and \"pishogue.\""

  "020044covenant": {
    "note": "With the \"planters' covenant,\" Stephen jumps two hundred years farther back in time, to the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, when the plantation system was being pursued as a way of subjugating the Irish population and consolidating control of land. \"Covenants\" were made between newly enriched Protestant \"planters\" and the English crown.",
    "expandedNote": " The Anglo-Norman invasions sponsored by King Henry II in the 12th century began the subjugation of Ireland, but English gains were massively diluted over the next few centuries. In some areas lands reverted to the control of Gaelic chieftains. In others, the now Hiberno-Norman lords intermarried with local noble families, grew independent of the Crown, spoke Irish, and often converted to Catholicism. This tide began to be reversed in 1541, when the Irish Parliament made Henry VIII King of England and Ireland, if only as a nominal overlord to the layers of local lords. But rebellions regularly disturbed the brief reign of Queen Mary I and the long one of Elizabeth.\n One English solution to the problem was the plantation system, whereby colonists were imported from England to settle on land that had been confiscated from Catholics—bringing with them Protestant religion, English language, and loyalty to the Crown. (The settlers were sometimes called \"New English,\" to distinguish them from the Old English who had gone native.) Gifford notes that \"A planter who received a grant of forfeited lands was required to 'covenant' his loyalty to the English Crown by acknowledging the English sovereign as head not only of the State but also of the Church.\" \n The plantation system continued to expand in the first half of the 17th century, under the reigns of James I, Charles I, and Oliver Cromwell. During the reign of the Scottish James, not only New English but also settlers from the Scottish Lowlands poured onto confiscated lands in Ulster, ruthlessly transforming the most Gaelic part of Ireland into the most militantly Protestant. Of these 17th century developments, Gifford notes that the system worked \"so effectively that the Roman Catholic population of Ireland was virtually reduced to feudal peasantry.\""

  "040049pleasantoldtimes": {
    "note": " The markedly Jewish train of thought initiated in Calypsoby Bloom's encounter with Dlugacz and the Zionist ads in his butcher shop continues as he thinks back to his earliest married years in the heavily Jewish quarter on the south central side of the city, near the Grand Canal. He and Molly lived first on \"Pleasants street,\" and in subsequent years on two nearby streets (Lombard Street West and Raymond Terrace), all of them within easy walking distance of the house that Bloom grew up in. During those early years the Blooms had multiple Jewish friends living close by, some of them no doubt people that Bloom knew from his family of origin. Punning on the street name, he remembers \"Pleasant evenings we had then,\" \"pleasant old times.\" But the friendships did not endure, because of Bloom's apostasy and his desire to integrate into Gentile society.",
    "expandedNote": " Bloom thinks in Oxen of the Sun of \"the old house in Clanbrassil Street\" where he was raised. Ithacaidentifies the address there as \"52 Clanbrassil street.\" Clanbrassil is a main thoroughfare in south central Dublin, running from the Grand Canal north toward the river, and changing its name to New Street and then Patrick Street as it approaches St. Patrick's Cathedral. \n For about four years after their marriage in 1888, the Blooms lived on \"Pleasants Street.\" The western end of Pleasants lies barely a quarter of a mile northeast of the Clanbrassil house. \"Lombard Street West\" (recalled in Hades, Lestrygonians, Sirens, Nausicaa, and Penelope), where the Blooms lived in parts of 1892 and 1893, begins at Clanbrassil mere feet from the house that Bloom was born in, and extends less than a quarter of a mile to the east. \"Raymond Terrace\" (mentioned in Hades and Penelope), where Rudy was conceived early in 1893, is not really a separate street, but rather a row of houses fronting the South Circular Road. It lies at the southern end of Raymond Street, which runs parallel to Clanbrassil a couple of hundred feet to the west. \n Two other streets mentioned in Calypso lie in the same area. Saint Kevin's Parade is a short, twisting, bifurcated street just a block north of Lombard. Arbutus Place is an even shorter street that begins at Lombard and runs south for only one block, dead-ending before it reaches St. Vincent Street South. Bloom thinks of these streets because when they lived in the neighborhood he and Molly were friends with several Jewish couples. He thinks of \"poor Citron . . . in St. Kevin's Parade,\" who had a \"basketchair\" that Molly sat in, and of \"Moisel . . . Arbutus Place.\" Cyclops notes that Moses Herzog, the Jewish moneylender whose complaint has sent the unnamed narrator up to Arbour Hill, lives in \"13 Saint Kevin's parade.\" \n In The Jews of Ireland, Louis Hyman observes that an Israel Citron did in fact live at 17 St. Kevin's Parade; he was listed in the 1904 Thom's as J. Citron, apparently a mistake for I. (329). Joyce's fictional Citron was almost certainly married, because Molly thinks in Penelope of the voyeuristic student, Penrose, \"that stopped in no 28 with the Citrons.\" (Her address, it should be noted, does not agree with the one listed in Thom's.)\n \"Moisel\" was likewise married: Bloom thinks in Hades of \"Molly and Mrs Moisel\" being pregnant at the same time—\"Funny sight two of them together, their bellies out.\" Gifford observes that a man named M. Moisel lived at 20 Arbutus Place in 1904, but Hyman associates the fictional character with Nisan Moisel, who had two sons named Elyah Wolf Moisel and Philip Moisel. This fits with a death that Bloom thinks of in Ithaca—\"Philip Moisel (pyemia, Heytesbury street)\"—but Nisan was born in 1814, more than half a century before Bloom, so it seems exceedingly unlikely that he should be considered the model for Bloom's friend. (Heytesbury Street too is in the neighborhood. On the map reproduced here, it can be seen intersecting with the west end of Pleasants Street.) \n According to Hyman, Bloom's third Jewish friend, \"Mastiansky with the old cither,\" is Joyce's mistake (substituting \"t\" for \"l\") for a grocer named P. Masliansky who lived at 16 St. Kevin's Parade. In the book his given name too is different: \"Julius (Juda),\" according to Ithaca. In Hades and again in IthacaBloom recalls conversations that he had with Mastiansky, and Molly seems to have had intimate conversations with his wife; she thinks that it would be better for Boylan to \"put it into me from behind the way Mrs Mastiansky told me her husband made her like the dogs do it.\" \n These old friendships from a Jewish part of town matter to Bloom not only because of the good memories that remain with him, but also because of the guilt that he harbors as a result of renouncing the Jewish faith. When his apotheosis turns sour in Circe, Mastiansky and Citron show up in orthodox garb to condemn him. They \"approach in gaberdines, wearing long earlocks,\" \"wag their beards at Bloom,\" and call him \"Belial! Laemlein of Istria, the false Messiah! Abulafia! Recant!\" Later in the same chapter, all three appear in a list of \"the circumcised\" (which Bloom is not) ritually bewailing his fall: \"Bloom, broken, closely veiled for the sacrifice, sobs, his face to the earth. The passing bell is heard. Darkshawled figures of the circumcised, in sackcloth and ashes, stand by the wailing wall. M. Shulomowitz, Joseph Goldwater, Moses Herzog, Harris Rosenberg, M. Moisel, J. Citron, Minnie Watchman, O. Mastiansky, The Reverend Leopold Abramovitz, Chazen. With swaying arms they wail in pneuma over the recreant Bloom.\" (The initial O. before Mastiansky's name disagrees both with actual fact and with the name that Joyce gives him elsewhere in the book. Gabler's edition amends it to P.) \n Ontario Terrace, where the Blooms lived in 1897, lies outside the heavily Jewish neighborhood referenced in Calypso, but not very far away. On the map reproduced here, it is in the lower right, just beyond the Grand Canal. Holles Street and Eccles Street, however, are not close."

  "010153plumpface": {
    "note": " Having approached Stephen's consciousness with the word \"Chrysostomos,\" the narrative enters its orbit again by saying that Mulligan's \"plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages.\" Thornton cites good evidence from a 1912 essay by Joyce to suppose that he had in mind Pope Alexander VI (Roderigo Borgia, father of Cesare and Lucrezia), a notoriously corrupt Renaissance pontiff and famous patron of the arts.",
    "expandedNote": " The word \"plump\" may have conveyed some of Mulligan's consciousness of himself in the novel's first sentence, but when the narrative returns to it (three more times in Telemachus), it conveys Stephen Dedalus' distrust of his companion. Stephen thinks of “the wellfed voice beside him” with the same distaste that he later feels for the “moneyed voices” of students at a British school. \n Like Joyce himself at the same age, Stephen has recently returned from a self-imposed exile in Paris where he had little to eat. (Joyce complained often and pitifully to his mother, who sent him money orders when she could.) From this perspective, Mulligan's \"plump\" appearance evokes Stephen's lean and hungry resentment of his well-fed benefactor. \n Church patrons like Alexander were often imperious to the painters, sculptors, architects, and musicians whose work they facilitated, and the artists inevitably had to balance their own artistic visions against the aesthetic and ideological requirements of their patrons. Stephen has good reason to feel that Mulligan does not have his best artistic interests at heart, just as he knows that Mulligan scorns his hunger—a notable failure of compassion in a man who purports to be charitably supporting him."

  "050016pottedmeat": {
    "note": " The \"Plumtree's Potted Meat\" that fed Joyce's appetite for multiple entendres was an actual commercial product, but he invented the inane advertising jingle that infects Bloom's consciousness as he peruses the Freeman's Journal in Lotus Eaters, as well as the bizarre placement of this ad under the obituaries that occupies his thoughts in Lestrygonians. Even Joyce's assignment of the product to an Irish manufacturer in Ithaca is contrary to fact. It is possible that he simply made a mistake on this last detail, but if he did knowingly misidentify the country of origin, then the sexual and sepultural associations of Plumtree's humble product are joined by some interesting political suggestions.",
    "expandedNote": " Gifford glosses \"To pot one's meat\" as \"crude slang for to copulate,\" and that meaning resonates with the other accidental sexual insinuations that assail Bloom as he stands talking to M'Coy about Molly's upcoming singing tour. (\"Who's getting it up?\" \"Part shares and part profits.\") Plumtree's ceramic pots proclaimed that they contained \"home potted meats.\" Joyce's advertising jingle removes the word \"home\" from the producer and gives it to the consumer:\n What is home without\n Plumtree's Potted Meat?\n Incomplete.\n With it an abode of bliss.\n Later chapters, particularly Lestrygonians, will suggest that Bloom's home did reasonably approximate an abode of bliss in the years when he and Molly were enjoying satisfying carnal relations, and their marriage certainly did become incomplete when those relations ceased after Rudy's death, early in 1894.\nAs if to ensure that the jingle's taunting insinuations will not go unnoticed, life later imitates the art of advertising.Ithaca notes that, next to the \"oval wicker basket bedded with fibre and containing one Jersey pear\" that Boylan has had sent ahead of him to 7 Eccles Street, there is \"an empty pot of Plumtree's potted meat,\" no doubt one of the contents of the basket. When Bloom climbs into bed beside Molly, he discovers \"the imprint of a human form, male, not his,\" as well as \"some crumbs, some flakes of potted meat, recooked, which he removed.\" In the course of repeatedly potting his meat Boylan has unpotted some as well, enacting the novel's recurrent association of picnics with sexual enjoyment.\n The discussion of Molly's concert tour comes just after the Freeman ad has impressed itself on Bloom's thoughts. Just before this, he and M'Coy have been discussing Paddy Dignam's death, and the ad reaches backward to encompass these associations as well. \"Potted meat\" perfectly captures the spirit of Bloom's meditations on burial in Hades, and in Lestrygonianshe reflects that the ad has acquired just such a resonance by virtue of its placement. He seems to believe that the gruesome association may not have been accidental. It is the kind of stunt that an advertiser named M'Glade might try: \"His ideas for ads like Plumtree's potted under the obituaries, cold meat department.\"\n Later in Lestrygonians Bloom allows his imagination to play with the equivalence between dead bodies and food, in an associative sequence that leads logically to thoughts of cannibalism: \"Potted meats. What is home without Plumtree's potted meat? Incomplete. What a stupid ad! Under the obituary notices they stuck it. All up a plumtree. Dignam's potted meat. Cannibals would with lemon and rice. White missionary too salty. Like pickled pork.\"\n § In Ithaca, as Bloom once more contemplates bad ads, Plumtree's returns to his mind as the worst of the worst. His thoughts veer from objective specificity to fantastic wordplay: \"Manufactured by George Plumtree, 23 Merchants' quay, Dublin, put up in 4 oz pots, and inserted by Councillor Joseph P. Nannetti, M. P., Rotunda Ward, 19 Hardwicke street, under the obituary notices and anniversaries of deceases. The name on the label is Plumtree. A plumtree in a meatpot, registered trade mark. Beware of imitations. Peatmot. Trumplee. Moutpat. Plamtroo.\" Not for the first time in Ithaca, the authoritative air of objective fact here masks a fictive falsification, for Joyce has transformed an English business concern into an Irish one.\n In \"Plumtree’s Potted Meat: The Productive Error of the Commodity in Ulysses,\" published in Texas Studies in Literature and Language 59.1 (Spring 2017): 57-75, Matthew Hayward observes that George W. Plumtree, 49 years old at the time of the 1901 census, was a \"Manufacturer of Preserved Provisions\" in Southport, England (61). The Census of Ireland in that year, and again in 1911, showed no people named Plumtree. Surviving Plumtree's pots bear one of two addresses in Southport, either 184 Portland Street or 13 Railroad Street (apparently the business moved at some point). From these English addresses, the firm shipped its products to a small agency in Dublin, which in turn distributed them to retailers. In 1904 that office was located at 23 Merchants' Quay. \n Thom's Dublin Directory misleadingly identified the Dublin wholesale operation as \"Plumtree, George W. potted meat manufacturer,\" so Joyce's perpetual reliance on Thom's may have caused him to unwittingly list the wrong address. But Hayward argues that he must also have been using other sources, probably contemporary advertisements, because Thom's makes no mention of the 4 oz. pots or the \"Home Potted Meats\" name. Joyce might even have been looking at an actual pot: in an endnote, Hayward records the fact that in 1905 he asked Stanislaus \"to bring a big can of tinned meat\" with him when he came to Trieste (Letters 2:121). Both the pots and surviving early 20th century ads clearly list an address in Southport, England. \n If Joyce did deliberately move Mr. Plumtree's business to Dublin, then the potted meat motif must be viewed in the context of the novel's many reflections on shipping beef and sheep to England and the loss of Irish home industry under British imperial rule. Englishmen bought Irish livestock tax-free. Businesses like Plumtree's created added value by manufacturing pots of ground-up unidentified meat parts and marketing them as home cooking, and shipped them back across the sea to Irish consumers, once again under favorable tariff arrangements. Specifying an address on Merchants' Quay for the business, Hayward notes, would \"seem to contain the product in the domestic Irish economy, appearing to fulfill the terms of the 'Buy Irish' movement that Joyce at one time endorsed as the best hope for Irish regeneration (Joyce, Letters 2:167)\" (61). \n But Plumtree's was not a home industry, and if the Dublin address is a calculated fiction then the novel is protesting the colonial economic arrangements which resulted in Ireland buying back its own meat, at a markup, from England. This strategy would cohere with Joyce's invention of a catchy ad promising improvement in people's home lives if they eat the right kind of food. Extending the scholarly work of Anne McClintock and Thomas Richards, Hayward describes how British businesses used imperial patriotic fervor to sell products like Pears' soap and Bovril beef tea through ads implying that their consumption helped spread enlightened, scientific, health-conscious civilization. He connects \"The commodity's promise of social improvement\" to a phrase in Joyce's fictional ad, \"an abode of bliss\" (70). \n Hayward does not, however, make one final connection that would enable a wholly new reading of Joyce's mock ad, consistent with the novel's other analogies between the misrule in Bloom's home on Eccles Street and advocacy of Home Rule for Ireland. The entire four-line text can be read as a comment on the atrophy of Irish economic enterprises under British colonial rule. What is our Irish home without industries like Plumtree's? Incomplete."

    "note": " Rather than simply identifying a potential problem (FMD) and a solution (inoculation), Deasy's letter sets the stage with a grand consideration of Irish economic history, past present and future. A thread of conspiracy-theory runs through it all, and after Stephen finishes reading the letter, Deasy tells him that conspiracies are thwarting his own efforts to call attention to the FMD problem: \"I am trying to work up influence with the department. Now I'm going to try publicity. I am surrounded by difficulties, by... intrigues by... backstairs influence by...\"",
    "expandedNote": " The \"department\" is presumably the \"department of agriculture,\" described in the letter as displaying \"pluterperfect imperturbability\" in the face of alarming information. (God, or Joyce, knows what Deasy means by pluterperfect, but the author liked the neologism enough to use the two-word phrase again in Oxen of the Sun). Deasy would like the department to consider the potential impact of FMD on \"our cattle trade,\" which (if prompt action is not taken) may go \"The way of all our old industries.\" (The glories of many of these industries are enumerated by the Citizen in Cyclops: \"Where are our missing twenty millions of Irish should be here today instead of four, our lost tribes? And our potteries and textiles, the finest in the whole world! And our wool that was sold in Rome in the time of Juvenal and our flax and our damask from the looms of Antrim and our Limerick lace, our tanneries and our white flint glass down there by Ballybough and our Huguenot poplin that we have since Jacquard de Lyon and our woven silk and our Foxford tweeds and ivory raised point from the Carmelite convent in New Ross, nothing like it in the whole wide world.\") \n Deasy thinks of a scheme in the 1850s and 60s to make \"Galway harbour\" a translatlantic port housing a Galway-Halifax steamship line, and of a \"Liverpool ring\" which allegedly sabotaged it to protect its own shipping interests. Citing Robert M. Adams' Surface and Symbol, Thornton concludes that there is no evidence of any such conspiracy and \"Deasy is mistaken again.\" Gifford summarizes the sorry history of the project and concludes that \"the evidence, on the contrary, points to the maritime incompetence of the promoters.\" Looking forward in time, Deasy predicts that a \"European conflagration\" (one would erupt in 1914) might disrupt shipping of \"Grain supplies through the narrow waters of the channel\" separating Ireland from England and Scotland. \n It is not certain what exactly these disasters past and future may have to do with \"That doctrine of laissez faire which so often in our history [. . . ],\" but presumably Deasy is urging the Department of Agriculture to adopt a proactive, interventionist policy, rather than passively waiting for foreseeable problems to wreak havoc on the economy."

It is also the most significant factor in the sexual dysfunction that is imperiling his marriage. His inability to perform in bed seems to stem not only from a desire to avoid the trauma of further loss, but also from a feeling that he was somehow responsible for Rudy's failure to thrive.",
    "expandedNote": " In Calypso Bloom remembers that Mrs. Thornton \"knew from the first poor little Rudy wouldn't live. Well, God is good, sir. She knew at once. He would be eleven now if he had lived.\" Ithaca supplies the exact dates: \"birth on 29 December 1893 of second (and only male) issue, deceased 9 January 1894, aged 11 days.\" In the \"10 years, 5 months and 18 days\" since Rudy's birth, \"carnal intercourse had been incomplete, without ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ.\" Actually, the dry spell has been slightly longer that that, the last \"complete carnal intercourse, with ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ, having last taken place 5 weeks previous, viz. 27 November 1893.\" \n Lestrygonians makes the connection between the loss of a child and the loss of sexual happiness explicit: \"I was happier then. Or was that I? Or am I now I? Twentyeight I was. She twentythree. When we left Lombard street west something changed. Could never like it again after Rudy.\" The omission of a subject from the verb phrase \"Could never like\" raises the logical possibility that the lack of sexual passion could be either the husband's or the wife's, but characterizations of the sexual relationship elsewhere in the novel leave no doubt that the problem is Bloom's. It is Molly who is starved for \"complete carnal intercourse.\" It is Bloom who diverts his attention to her backside. \n The appearance of a child's funeral cortège in Hades prompts Bloom to recall some folk nonsense about infant vitality: \"A dwarf's face, mauve and wrinkled like little Rudy's was. Dwarf's body, weak as putty, in a whitelined deal box. Burial friendly society pays. Penny a week for a sod of turf. Our. Little. Beggar. Baby. Meant nothing. Mistake of nature.

    "expandedNote": " On first encountering the potato in Calypso, perhaps the only plausible inference to draw is that, given the Irish context, it may have something to do with the Great Hunger. Bloom does think of the \"potato blight\" in Lestrygonians, and at the end of that chapter he notices his personal potato again as he searches for his lemon soap: \"Try all pockets. Handker. Freeman.Where did I? Ah, yes. Trousers. Potato. Purse. Where?\"\n But when the object next surfaces at the end of Oxen of the Sun, someone, somehow, apparently has noticed Bloom's possession and infers that he carries it as a prophylactic: \"Sir? Spud again the rheumatiz?\" When the potato reappears early in the next chapter, Circe, this impression is confirmed. After Bloom is nearly run down by a tram, he reaches instinctively for the potato: \"(He feels his trouser pocket.) Poor mamma's panacea.\"\n So the potato is a talisman or home remedy, and Bloom's mother, Ellen Higgins Bloom, gave it to him. Not long later, she shows up to save him from danger and reenacts the donation: \"O blessed Redeemer, what have they done to him! My smelling salts! (She hauls up a reef of skirt and ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat. A phial, an Agnus Dei, a shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out.) Sacred Heart of Mary, where were you at all, at all?\" \n As Bloom says to Zoe later in the chapter, the potato is \"A talisman. Heirloom.\" He tells her, \"Sir Walter Raleigh brought from the new world that potato and that weed [tobacco], the one a killer of pestilence by absorption, the other a poisoner of the ear, eye, heart, memory, will, understanding, all.\" Asking her to return it to him, he says, \"(With feeling.) It is nothing, but still, a relic of poor mamma.\" At the end of the long hallucinatory passage introduced by the mention of Sir Walter Raleigh and tobacco, when Bloom is burned at the stake, the Daughters of Erin invoke the \"Potato Preservative against Plague and Pestilence.\" \n In \"Faith and Betrayal: The Potato in Ulysses\" (JJQ28.1 [1990]: 269-76), Robert Merritt cites several relevant findings from Redcliffe N. Salaman's The History and Social Influence of the Potato (Cambridge UP, 1949, rpt. 1985). For many peasants in Ireland and other countries, Salaman writes, \"A dried tuber carried in the pocket, or suspended from the neck, is a sure protection against rheumatism. / A 'pealed' potato, if carried in the pocket of the same side as an aching tooth, will cure the latter as soon as it itself is reduced to crumbs\" (118). \n Salaman also observes that the Spanish conquistadores called the potato a turma de tierra or earth-testicle, perhaps prompted by \"the Aymara name choque which it is claimed stood equally for a potato tuber or a testicle\" (129). While Joyce clearly knows something of the history of the potato's importation from the New World, it seems incredible to suppose that he would have known of this etymological link with testicles. Nevertheless, Circe unmistakably makes the association. Zoe discovers the potato when she passes her hand over Bloom's pants to caress his cock: \"Has little mousey any tickles tonight? . . . How's the nuts?\" As Bloom blathers about which side his boys hang toward, she feels something hard and, concerned that it is a syphilitic \"chancre,\" reaches \"into his left trouser pocket and brings out a hard black shrivelled potato,\" and \"puts the potato greedily into a pocket.\" \n When Bloom eventually persuades Zoe to return what she has taken, \"She hauls up a reef of her slip, revealing her bare thigh, and unrolls the potato from the top of her stocking.\" As Merritt observes, \"The potato as a surrogate for Bloom has passed from his groin to hers and back again, symbolically performing the rite of sexual intercourse\" (273). This sexual exchange with Zoe clearly extends a circle of connections that began with Bloom's mother, because she too, like Zoe, \"hauls up a reef of skirt\" to give Bloom the potato. And Zoe's last name, of course, is . . . Higgins. The strong linguistic links between Ellen and Zoe, and their mutual circulation of the potato through Bloom, may say something about the Oedipal origins of his sexual desires. Alternatively, one might suppose that Ellen's gift protects him from the Circean allure of the prostitutes.\n Many Joyceans have observed that the potato in Circe seems to stand in for the sprig of moly that enables Odysseus to resist Circe's spells. Although Bloom differs from his epic prototype in temporarily losing his protective plant, the analogy does seem relevant, because he regains the potato just as he regains his manhood: he breaks the spell of the Nymph, rebukes Bella, takes the potato back from Zoe, and then makes sure that Stephen is not cheated of his money, earning Bella's admiration. This Homeric association adds to the many suggestions that the potato holds some kind of power to ward off evil or disease. \n Finally, Joyce curiously tucked into a distant chapter of his novel a reference to Jewish religious ritual that, if a reader should ever spot the connection, would make the initial mention of the potato in Calypso more suggestive of talismanic potency. In Nausicaa Bloom is pondering the dangers of seafaring (as befits his Odyssean role in that chapter), and thinks of lucky charms: \"Off he sails with a scapular or a medal on him for luck. Well. And the tephilim no what's this they call it poor papa's father had on his door to touch.\" As happens so often with his attempts to recall past learning, Bloom gets the word tephilim wrong, and knows it, though he is thinking of something very similar. A mezuzah is a decorated case containing verses from Deuteronomy that is affixed to the right-hand front doorpost of a Jewish home (and sometimes to the frame of every room in a house). The mezuzah functions as an amulet to ward off evil. And where did Bloom touch his potato in Calypso? \"On the doorstep\" of his house, before reaching back to pull the door shut behind him. Molly is probably recalling such a performance of remembered Jewish ritual when she thinks, \"didnt he kiss our halldoor yes he did what a madman nobody understands his cracked ideas but me.\"\n Of such incredibly fine, endlessly involuted patterning, Hugh Kenner says: \"this, assuming even that we possess the lore and have the luck to make the connection, is not something we might hope to think of when we first read of how Bloom crossed his threshold and said 'Potato I have,' because at that time we have some hundreds of pages to traverse before the meaning of 'potato' will have been disclosed. Nor, when we know the meaning, does it work retroactively, since by then we have surely forgotten the doorframe adjacent to the initial 'Potato I have.' . . . Joyce's strange book has no stranger aspect than this, that no one comprehensive reading is thinkable. . . . Ulysses is so designed that new readers, given, even, what cannot be postulated, ideal immunity to attention overload, cannot possibly grasp certain elements because of a warp in the order of presentation, and veteran readers will perceive after twenty years new lights going on as a consequence of a question they have only just thought to ask. Such a question would be: Why is Bloom made to advert to the potato just when he does, on a page where there seems no earthly reason for him to remember the potato or for us to be apprised of it? And when we think to ask something happens\" (Ulysses, 80)."

  "170008precedingseries": {
    "note": " There are a lot of suitors in Odysseus' palace: 108, according to Telemachus, though Homer identifies only 15 by name. In Ithaca Joyce identifies 25 men whom poor Bloom supposes have been somehow involved with his attractive wife.",
    "expandedNote": " The language of Ithaca suggests that all 25 of these men have been in bed with Molly. As he gets into bed with his wife, Bloom imagines other men doing the same: \"each one who enters imagines himself to be the first to enter whereas he is always the last term of a preceding series even if the first term of a succeeding one.\" The next question in the catechism asks, \"What preceding series?\" and the 25 names are spit back in response. But it is impossible that all of these men have slept with Molly. One clearly has. Another has engaged her in some heavy petting. Still another has kissed her. At least one more has flirted with her. But some have only gazed on her longingly, or bumped up against her body, or asked leering questions. For many others, the book offers no evidence that anything at all has happened. If the list in Ithaca represents Bloom's thoughts, then it reads like a paranoiac's nightmare. Significantly, though, the list omits at least one man with whom Molly has been romantically and sexually involved, apparently during the time of her marriage: Lieutenant Stanley G. Gardner.\n The reader is placed in much the same position as Bloom, forced to peep through closed blinds, drawing conclusions from very limited information. It seems likely that Ithaca is playing with us, sounding authoritative while wrapping fantastic fictional concoctions around a few nuggets of fact. To make sense of the list, readers must become detectives, seeking information from many sources. The best comes from Molly herself, in Penelope. Other details come from Bloom's memories and the testimony of a few other characters. Here is a brief rundown of all 25 supposed love interests, in the order named in Ithaca:\n 1) \"Mulvey\": a young officer in the British navy, Molly's first love when she was an adventurous teenager in Gibraltar, before she knew Bloom. She recalls details of their kissing and fondling, which stopped short of intercourse, and remembers a pact to remain faithful until his return: \"and if I was married hed do it to me and I promised him yes faithfully Id let him block me.\"Nausicaa shows that Bloom knows the story of \"lieutenant Mulvey that kissed her under the Moorish wall beside the gardens. Fifteen she told me. But her breasts were developed.\" He doesn't seem to know about the promise to cuckold her future husband, and he does not think about Mulvey coming back into Molly's life.\n 2) \"Penrose\": a student who gazed on the undressed Molly from an adjacent apartment when the Blooms lived in Lombard Street West. Bloom tries to recall his name in Lestrygonians: \"What was the name of that priestylooking chap was always squinting in when he passed? Weak eyes, woman. Stopped in Citron's saint Kevin's parade. Pen something. Pendennis? My memory is getting. Pen ...? of course it's years ago.\" Later in the chapter, the thought that the blind stripling has a face like a priest's jogs his memory: \"Penrose! That was that chap's name.\" Molly remembers him looking in the window one day when she was washing her breasts after nursing Milly: \"that delicate looking student that stopped in no 28 with the Citrons Penrose nearly caught me washing through the window only for I snapped up the towel to my face.\" So, for Bloom, another man's voyeuristic interest in his wife is tantamount to adultery.\n 3) \"Bartell d'Arcy\": a singer on Dublin's concert circuit. Bloom thinks of him in Lestrygonians as a \"Conceited fellow with his waxedup moustache,\" and Molly unflatteringly compares his affected singing with the natural delivery of Simon Dedalus: \"he had a delicious glorious voice Phoebe dearest goodbye sweetheart sweetheart he always sang it not like Bartell Darcy sweet tart goodbye.\" However, it appears that something has happened between Molly and Mr. d'Arcy: \"Bartell dArcy too that he used to make fun of when he commenced kissing me on the choir stairs after I sang Gounods Ave Maria what are we waiting for O my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part which is my brown part he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too my low notes he was always raving about if you can believe him I liked the way he used his mouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a place like that I dont see anything so terrible about it Ill tell him about that some day not now and surprise him ay and Ill take him there and show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like it or lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing.\" Actually, this attraction has not happened without Bloom knowing. Like his wife, he has an ability to make highly informed inferences.\n 4) \"Professor Goodwin\": a pianist, Molly's accompanist for several years, who was quite old and frail by the end of their association, and not terribly reliable on the piano. In Calypso Bloom thinks, \"Poor old professor Goodwin. Dreadful old case.\" In Lestrygonians he recalls walking on a cool windy night with Bartell d'Arcy while Molly and Professor Goodwin went on ahead of them: \"Professor Goodwin linking her in front. Shaky on his pins, poor old sot. His farewell concerts. Positively last appearance on any stage. May be for months and may be for never. Remember her laughing at the wind, her blizzard collar up. Corner of Harcourt road remember that gust. Brrfoo! Blew up all her skirts and her boa nearly smothered old Goodwin.\" Sirens offers another memory of the old pianist: \"Poor old Goodwin was the pianist that night, Father Cowley reminded them. There was a slight difference of opinion between himself and the Collard grand.\" Circe exaggerates his infirmity: \"bent in two from incredible age,\" the professor \"totters across the room, his hands fluttering. He sits tinily on the pianostool .\" All in all, it seems that Bloom has little to fear from this man, and Molly's words confirm that. She thinks of the same windy \"night after Goodwins botchup of a concert,\" recalling happily that she made Bloom \"spend once with my foot\" later that evening. She remembers being unhappily surprised at the door of her house by \"old frostyface Goodwin\" one day when her appearance was messed up by working in the kitchen; still, she thinks, \"he was a real old gent in his way it was impossible to be more respectful.\" Finally, she advances a theory on why the old man's musical skills had fallen off so badly: \"he was a patent professor of John Jameson,\" i.e. the bottle. The fact that Bloom can fear the courteous advances of an old, shaky, washed-up alcoholic seems to say more about Bloom than about Goodwin. \n 5) \"Julius Mastiansky\": a friend, probably Jewish, from the early days of the Blooms' marriage. Bloom thinks of him only in connection with music: \"Mastiansky with the old cither. Pleasant evenings we had then.\" Molly does not recall any romantic involvement with him, but she did have some frank discussions about sex with his wife. Boylan's uncomfortable bulk makes her wish for doggy-style sex, a variation she has apparently never tried: \"scrooching down on me like that all the time with his big hipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat always having to lie down for them better for him put it into me from behind the way Mrs Mastiansky told me her husband made her like the dogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so quiet and mild with his tingating cither.\" Apparently she feels some bemusement that the quiet and mild cither-player liked to practice such an exotic sexual feat—and, quite clearly, he never practiced it with her.\n 6) \"John Henry Menton\": an actual solicitor (or lawyer) who was fictionally present at a party at Mat Dillon's house on the evening when Bloom and Molly first met. There, Bloom bested him in a lawn bowling move in front of some watching ladies, one of whom was Molly. Menton barely knows Bloom, but he does remember the lawn bowling incident inHades: \"What is he? he asked. What does he do? Wasn't he in the stationery line? I fell foul of him one evening, I remember, at bowls.\" Bloom recalls it too: \"Yes, Menton. Got his rag out that evening on the bowling green because I sailed inside him. Pure fluke of mine: the bias. Why he took such a rooted dislike to me. Hate at first sight. Molly and Floey Dillon linked under the lilactree, laughing. Fellow always like that, mortified if women are by.\" The incident probably involved a little more than simple embarrassment in the presence of females. Menton remembers Molly warmly: \"I haven't seen her for some time. She was a finelooking woman. I danced with her, wait, fifteen seventeen golden years ago, at Mat Dillon's in Roundtown. And a good armful she was.\" Bloom's success with her seems to rile him: \"In God's name, John Henry Menton said, what did she marry a coon like that for? She had plenty of game in her then.\" Bloom needn't feel jealous, though, as Molly thinks Menton is a vile lecher and an idiot: \"that big babbyface I saw him and he not long married flirting with a young girl at Pooles Myriorama and turned my back on him when he slinked out looking quite conscious what harm but he had the impudence to make up to me one time well done to him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all the big stupoes I ever met and thats called a solicitor.\"\n 7) \"Father Bernard Corrigan\": a priest who confessed Molly in such a way as to suggest some prurient interest. Molly's account of the conversation is hilarious: \"I hate that confession when I used to go to Father Corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did where and I said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your person my child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where you sit down yes O Lord couldnt he say bottom right out and have done with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put it I forget no father and I always think of the real father what did he want to know for when I already confessed it to God he had a nice fat hand the palm moist always I wouldnt mind feeling it neither would he Id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar I wonder did he know me in the box I could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never turn or let on.\" She thinks, \"Id like to be embraced by one in his vestments.\" So Molly has not done anything with the possibly leering Father Corrigan, but she has fantasized about it. She does not recall his first name, but the novel twice mentions a Bernard Corrigan who is Paddy Dignam's brother-in-law. \n 8) \"A farmer at the Royal Dublin Society's horse show\": someone that Molly expressed some kind of strong reaction to at a fancy gathering. The reaction sounds like ridicule, but possibly Bloom heard something more in it. He thinks of this man after getting all worked up by Gerty's finery in Nausicaa: \"Wonder how is she feeling in that region. Shame all put on before third person. More put out about a hole in her stocking. Molly, her underjaw stuck out, head back, about the farmer in the ridingboots and spurs at the horse show.\" Does he think that the boots and spurs had the same powerful sexual effect on Molly that Gerty's undergarments have had on him? If so, Molly does not confirm or deny the hypothesis.\n 9) \"Maggot O'Reilly\": an unknown. In Circe Bloom mentions him in the course of an incoherent ramble to Josie Breen about things his wife has done: \"And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across...\" Should the reader hear a second meaning in cock? Molly has nothing to say about the man. But this makes two instances of Bloom reading sexual interest into her laughter. Maybe he knows something about the matter?\n 10) \"Matthew Dillon\": one of a pair of well-off brothers that both Bloom and Molly knew before they met. A party at Mat Dillon's house in the suburbs brought them together, but Mat was considerably older (we learn in Nausicaa that he already had a \"bevy of daughters: Tiny, Atty, Floey, Maimy, Louy, Hetty\"), and Molly does not think about him in any romantic way. \n 11) \"Valentine Blake Dillon (Lord Mayor of Dublin)\": the other brother, who actually was Lord Mayor in 1894-95. InNausicaa Bloom remembers a dinner in Glencree at which the \"Lord mayor had his eye on her. Val Dillon.\" Molly remembers it too, with displeasure: \"the lord Mayor looking at me with his dirty eyes Val Dillon that big heathen.\" Another voyeur.\n 12) \"Christopher Callinan\": a real-life Dublin journalist who is the brother-in-law of the fictional Ignatius Gallaher, according to Lenehan in Aeolus. Neither Bloom nor Molly recalls any improprities involving him, though he was present on the horsecart ride with Lenehan described below. \n 13) \"Lenehan\": a lowlife leech who obsequiously admires the sexual exploits of John Corley in Two Gallants (a story in Dubliners) and Blazes Boylan in Sirens. In Wandering Rocks he tells M'Coy how he took advantage of an after-midnight carriage ride from Glencree to Dublin over the suggestively named Featherbed Mountain to repeatedly bump into Molly's breasts: \"She was well primed with a good load of Delahunt's port under her bellyband. Every jolt the bloody car gave I had her bumping up against me. Hell's delights! She has a fine pair, God bless her. . . . I was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time. Know what I mean? . . . The lad stood to attention anyhow, he said with a sigh. She's a gamey mare and no mistake. Bloom was pointing out all the stars and the comets in the heavens to Chris Callinan and the jarvey: the great bear and Hercules and the dragon, and the whole jingbang lot. But, by God, I was lost, so to speak, in the milky way. He knows them all, faith. At last she spotted a weeny weeshy one miles away. And what star is that, Poldy? says she. By God, she had Bloom cornered. That one, is it? says Chris Callinan, sure that's only what you might call a pinprick. By God, he wasn't far wide of the mark.\" Lenehan was in a fine state of excitement, and it seems that Bloom as well as Molly was aware of it, but she dismisses him in a word: \"that sponger he was making free with me after the Glencree dinner coming back that long joult over the featherbed mountain.\" \n 14) \"An Italian organgrinder\": according to Gifford's plausible reading, the \"hurdygurdy boy\" whom Bloom associates with Molly in Sirens as he thinks of \"songs without words.\" He saw some kind of communication passing between them: \"She knew he meant the monkey was sick. Or because so like the Spanish. Understand animals too that way.\" \n 15) \"An unknown gentleman in the Gaiety Theatre\": a \"gentleman of fashion\" whom Molly remembers was \"staring down at me\" through his opera glasses from a private box, while Bloom talked to her about Spinoza. Bloom remembers the moment in Sirens (he thinks she was \"Hypnotized, listening\" to him when in fact she was just preoccupied because her period was starting), but he does not think of the gentleman in that passage. Still another voyeur, simply looking.\n 16) \"Benjamin Dollard\": a burly singer with a resonant bass voice, presently in strained financial circumstances. Both Bloom and Molly remember him coming to visit when they lived in Holles Street, looking to purchase an evening suit to perform in. The Blooms found a suit and gave it to him, but as Bloom recalls in Sirens the pants did not fit well: \"Night he ran round to us to borrow a dress suit for that concert. Trousers tight as a drum on him. Musical porkers. Molly did laugh when he went out. Threw herself back across the bed, screaming, kicking. With all his belongings on show. O saints above, I'm drenched! O, the women in the front row! O, I never laughed so many!\" Molly still relishes the memory of Dollard \"squeezed and squashed into them and grinning all over his big Dolly face like a wellwhipped childs botty didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough that must have been a spectacle on the stage imagine paying 5/- in the preserved seats for that to see him trotting off in his trowlers.\" Other than this amusement at the sight of Ben's crown jewels on display, the novel reveals no sexual interest that Molly has taken in the man, but her concentration on his genitals seems to have been sufficient to alarm Bloom.\n 17) \"Simon Dedalus\": Stephen's father, and a very good tenor. Molly sang a duet with him once and relished the coupling: \"he had the gift of the voice so there was no art in it all over you like a warm showerbath O Maritana wildwood flower we sang splendidly though it was a bit too high for my register even transposed.\" And she remembers that \"he was always on for flirtyfying too.\" Bloom listens to Simon sing in Sirens and thinks, \"tenors get women by the score\" (a bad joke). Simon has qualities that turn Molly off. She doesn't like his alcoholism: \"he was always turning up half screwed singing the second verse first.\" And he is \"such a criticiser.\" But her description of their duet does suggest a certain intimate comfort with him.\n 18) \"Andrew (Pisser) Burke\": a fellow lodger whom the Blooms knew when they were staying at the City Arms hotel, as we first learn in Cyclops. Molly's words suggest that Burke may possibly have been eyeing her, but she clearly has contempt for him: \"that longnosed chap I dont know who he is with that other beauty Burke out of the City Arms hotel was there spying around as usual on the slip always where he wasnt wanted.\" Bloom may be threatened by voyeurs, but she is not interested.\n 19) \"Joseph Cuffe\": one of the family owners of a cattle-trading business at which Bloom was employed. Molly thinks that her husband \"could have been in Mr Cuffes still only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up I could have got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great mirada once or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly Mrs Bloom only I felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress that I lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it.\" Bloom, then, conspired to send Molly to flirt with an employer who evidently admired her, essentially pimping her in an effort to keep his job. But he did not keep the job, much less become promoted, so it seems very unlikely that Molly did anything more than talk Mr. Cuffe out of his initial \"stiff\" formality.\n 20) \"Wisdom Hely\": the real-life owner of a stationery and printing shop in Dublin. In Lestrygonians Bloom recalls that he \"Got the job in Wisdom Hely's year we married,\" 1888. But he does not recall anything happening between his employer and his wife. Neither does she. \n 21) \"Alderman John Hooper\": a real person in Dublin who fictionally gave the Blooms a wedding present, a stuffed owl. Bloom thinks of the owl in Hades and again in Ithaca, where we see it still standing \"on the mantelpiece.\" Neither he nor Molly, however, thinks of Alderman John making any sexual or romantic advances.\n 22) \"Dr Francis Brady\": a physician who gave Molly a \"belladonna prescription\" to help with the nipple pain she was experiencing as she tried to wean Milly. Apparently Bloom cannot think of that level of physical intimacy existing without some sexual feeling being involved—a not totally unreasonable assumption, but it hardly rises to the level of adultery.\n 23) \"Father Sebastian of Mount Argus\": a total mystery, as neither Molly nor Bloom mentions him. \n 24) \"A bootblack at the General Post Office\": ditto. \n 25) \"Hugh E. (Blazes) Boylan\": quite certainly and emphatically a sexual threat to Bloom, as he achieves multiple orgasms with Molly during the late afternoon and early evening of June 16, and gives her multiple orgasms as well. Molly considers running away with Boylan and becoming his wife, but she does not seem romantically taken with him. She does plan to continue the affair. \n The long list, then, begins and ends with men who have been sexually involved with Molly, but most of what comes between seems tendentious and fantastic, almost in the spirit of the long lists of real and (increasingly) unreal names that help make Cyclops and Circe so funny. Interestingly, the names of these men often seem to cluster together in the text. Penrose, Bartell d'Arcy, and Professor Goodwin occur to Bloom in quick succession in Lestrygonians. Val Dillon, Lenehan, and Chris Callinan were all involved in the Glencree dinner. Molly thinks first of Penrose and then of Doctor Brady in connection with her nursing. Ben Dollard, Bartell d'Arcy, and Simon Dedalus run together in her thoughts about singing. It is almost as if certain events oractivities have been charged with sexual feeling, and the people connected with those events thereby become objects of alarm for Bloom."

    "note": " Joyce was perfectly capable of savaging Irish Catholic priests for taking craven political positions. But he does not allow Mr. Deasy, a polemicist for Protestant rule, to do so without committing still another distortion of the historical record. Deasy charges that \"the prelates of your communion denounced\" Daniel O'Connell \"as a demagogue.\" Catholic bishops and archbishops strongly supported O'Connell's efforts to win voting rights for Catholics, though they were spooked by his subsequent efforts to repeal the Act of Union. They never \"denounced\" him.",
    "expandedNote": " The Irish church, once Romanized, had produced a long line of \"castle-bishops\": leaders finely tuned to the concerns of the Castle in Dublin and the Parliament in Westminster. But despite this acquiescence to empire among the princes of the church, many Irish priests, and even some bishops, sympathized with nationalist aspirations in the 19th century and lent them verbal encouragement. The line between tolerable and anathematizable nationalism was drawn through the terrain of illegal protest and violent revolution. The Church had learned from the French revolutionaries and from their Italian imitators (the Carbonari, Mazzini, Garibaldi) to dread armed uprisings, and in the late 1850s and early 60s it saw them threatening to appear in Ireland, in the Fenian movement. \n Priests denounced the Fenians and the Irish Republican Brotherhood from the pulpit, and sometimes refused to grant absolution after confession to people who admitted membership in one or the other organization. They took their direction from the top, in the person of Archbishop Paul Cullen, who in 1867 became the first Irish cardinal in history. In 1861 Cullen refused to allow the body of Terence MacManus to lie in state in the Pro-Cathedral of Dublin, and forbade priests to participate in the funeral. MacManus was a supporter of O'Connell who had become a fenian, was arrested and sentenced to transportation to Australia, escaped, and died in the US, from whence his body was returned to Ireland. One priest defied the archbishop's ban, and the funeral drew an immense crowd—to the satisfaction of the fenians and the discomfiture of the church.\n Joyce was aware of this episode, and of many other ways in which the Irish Catholic church had lent tepid support to nationalist efforts throughout the preceding century. In the Christmas dinner scene in A Portrait of the Artist, Simon Dedalus' revolutionary friend Mr. Casey sums up the whole history, in terms no less critical than Deasy's: \"—Didn't the bishops of Ireland betray us in the time of the union when Bishop Lanigan presented an address of loyalty to the Marquess Cornwallis? Didn't the bishops and priests sell the aspirations of their country in 1829 in return for catholic emancipation? Didn't they denounce the fenian movement from the pulpit and in the confessionbox? And didn't they dishonour the ashes of Terence Bellew MacManus?\" Simon chimes in, with \"a guffaw of coarse scorn\": \"—O, by God, he cried, I forgot little old Paul Cullen! Another apple of God's eye!\" Simon contemns not only Cullen but also William Walsh (seen in the top picture), a strong nationalist who became more conservative after the Parnell scandal broke: \"Respect! he said. Is it for Billy with the lip or for the tub of guts up in Armagh? Respect! —Princes of the church, said Mr. Casey with slow scorn.\""

The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak frequently of the collector of prepuces.\" Adopting the persona of an ethnographer detailing the exotic cultural practices of his countrymen to a visiting colleague, Mulligan explains their belief in a strange deity called Jehovah (aka God) who judges the loyalty of his followers by their willingness to slice rings of skin off the genital organs of their infant male offspring. Joyce no doubt wishes to offend Irish Catholics, but he may also be setting his sights higher: on the Holy Father and his conclave of cardinals in Rome.",

Exposed penises make the scientific Bloom think of issues like “tumidity,\" \"sanitariness,\" size, and hairiness, but they turn Stephen’s mind to the circumcision of Jesus Christ, and particularly to the question of “whether the divine prepuce, the carnal bridal ring of the holy Roman catholic apostolic church, conserved in Calcata, were deserving of simple hyperduly or of the fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine excrescences as hair and toenails.” Gifford glosses the question posed by the dual nature of Christ: \"is this relic a part of the body of Jesus, in which case it is due latria, the highest kind of worship, paid to God only . . . or is the relic 'human,' thus meriting hyperdulia, the veneration given to the Virgin Mary as the most exalted of human beings?\" (586). \n Christ’s foreskin, the only part of the divine body left behind on earth (not counting hair, sloughed skin, fingernails, and toenails), was indeed regarded not only as a holy relic, but as a “carnal bridal ring.” A book by David Farley, An Irreverent Curiosity: In Search of the Church’s Strangest Relic in Italy’s Oddest Town (2009) notes that Catherine of Siena, the medieval saint, was reported to have worn her Lord’s foreskin as a ring around her finger. In doing so she was probably following the practice of many medieval female religious of becoming quite literally married to Christ—a phenomenon explored in Sarah McNamer’s Affective Meditation and the Invention of Medieval Compassion (2009). Later, though, the sacred penis part ended up in the north Italian hill town of Calcata, making the town’s church an important pilgrimage destination. Farley’s adventure story starts from the fact that, in December 1983, the church’s parish priest announced to his congregation that the foreskin of Jesus had disappeared. \n In addition to confirming what Stephen says about bridal rings and about Calcata, Farley’s book discusses something that is never mentioned in Ulysses but that may very well account for Mulligan’s and Stephen’s strange obsession. Although the divine foreskin had been an object of veneration for many centuries, and at one point belonged to the Vatican, Calcata’s long history of marketing it to pilgrims excited embarrassment and other ill feelings (penis envy?) among the princes of the church, and changes in Catholic theology made veneration of divine genitals more problematic than it had previously been. In 1900, therefore, the Vatican decreed that the parish could display its prize holding only on New Year’s Day. It declared, furthermore, that from that day forth anyone who spoke about the divine foreskin would be subject to excommunication. Given the fact that Joyce is up to speed on other aspects of the divine prepuce, it seems likely that he would have known about this papal ban. If so, he is making a point of spectacularly defying it, once in Telemachus, again in Scylla and Charybdis, and most volubly in Ithaca."

  "030058pretenders": {
    "note": " In Proteus Stephen thinks of Ireland, \"then and now,\" as a \"Paradise of pretenders.\" In the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries a number of quixotic pretenders to English and Irish thrones used the island as their stage. The \"then\" part of Stephen's judgment is clear enough, but it is harder to say what contemporary relevance he may see in the stories he calls up.",
    "expandedNote": " \"The Bruce's brother\" was Edward Bruce, younger brother of Robert the Bruce, the Gaelic-Norman chieftain who became King of Scotland in 1306 and won independence from the English at the battle of Bannockburn in 1314. Edward supported his brother in the Scottish wars, and then in late May 1315 invaded Ireland in an effort to engage the English on another front and aid O'Neills in Ulster who were being attacked by Anglo-Irish forces. The Bruce brothers had entertained pleas for assistance from Domhnall (Donnell) Ó Néill, and they agreed to invade on the condition that Irish Gaelic lords would support Edward in his ambition to become King of Ireland. (The two brothers, despite their Norman roots, apparently envisioned a pan-Celtic array of kingdoms encircling England.) \n After the invasion and some minimal conquests, a dozen lords swore fealty to Edward as High King of Ireland. Other Irish kings nominally recognized his supremacy, but Edward did not control more than parts of Ulster. Over the next two years he waged some successful military campaigns, expanding his territorial reach somewhat but alienating much of the population through massacres. His supporters sent a request to the Vatican, asking the Pope to revoke the Laudabiliter bull that had recognized the Plantagenets as the overlords of Ireland and instead acknowledge Edward as King. The Pope did not comply, and in 1318 Edward was defeated at the battle of Faughart by Sir John de Bermingham, an Anglo-Irish leader. Reinforcements from Robert were only days away, but Edward apparently rushed the battle in order to gain more glory for himself. His unpopular body, it is said, was quartered and distributed throughout Ireland; the head went to King Edward II in England. (How this may cohere with his having a grave in Faughart, Lord knows.)\n The other three stories concern the FitzGeralds or \"Geraldines,\" Anglo-Norman lords mentioned in Wandering Rocks. \"Thomas Fitzgerald, silken knight,\" the 10th Earl of Kildare, is the only native Irishman in Stephen's list. He was called Silken Thomas because his followers wore silk badges on their helmets. In 1534 his father Gerald was called to London, leaving his son, age 21, behind as his deputy. Thomas received inaccurate information that his father had been executed in the Tower of London, and responded by publicly renouncing his allegiance to Henry VIII—news which greatly vexed and saddened the old man. Thomas attacked Dublin Castle, unsuccessfully; Gifford notes that \"his power was limited and he had no powder and shot, at that time modern and necessary military supplies.\" His power dwindled through a series of further strategic miscalculations, including the execution of an archbishop that cost him the support of the clergy. Late in the summer of 1535 he submitted to Henry's representative in Ireland, Lord Grey, and was sent to the Tower in London. Grey had given him assurances of his safety, but in February 1537 he and five of his uncles were hanged at Tyburn. In Wandering Rocks Ned Lambert tells the Rev. Hugh Love that \"We are standing in the historic council chamber of saint Mary's abbey where silken Thomas proclaimed himself a rebel in 1534. This is the most historic spot in all Dublin. O'Madden Burke is going to write something about it one of these days.\"\n The last two men in Stephen's list were pretenders in a more familiar sense, both of them supported by Thomas' grandfather, the so-called Great Earl, in their claims against the rule of King Henry VII. Perkin Warbeck, York's false scion, in breeches of silk of whiterose ivory, wonder of a day,\" falsely claimed to be Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York, the second son of Edward IV—one of the two \"Young Princes,\" heirs apparent to the throne of England, whom Richard, Duke of Gloucester (afterward Richard III), the boys' uncle and Lord Protector, committed to the Tower for safekeeping when their father died in 1483. The boys disappeared, but some people believed that they had escaped assassination. \n Little is definitely known about Perkin Warbeck's early life, but according to the account of it that he later gave while imprisoned, he was born to a Flemish mercantile family. He was about the same age that Richard would have been, and struck many people as bearing a resemblance to Edward IV. At some point he conceived the idea of claiming that the murderers in the Tower had spared him, the younger brother. Shuttling back and forth between various noble supporters in France, Scotland, and Ireland (where the Great Earl supported the Yorkist cause), he staged three different military expeditions into England, all of them abysmally unsuccessful. In the last, at the head of a Cornish army in 1497, he panicked at the appearance of Henry VII's forces, deserted the field, and was captured. Henry released him from the Tower when he confessed to being an impostor, but, Gifford notes, \"he couldn't leave well enough alone and got involved in another conspiracy, thereby earning his ticket to Tyburn.\" \n \"Lambert Simnel, with a tail of nans and sutlers, a scullion crowned,\" alludes to yet another Yorkist conspiracy against the new Tudor dynasty, slightly before Warbeck's. Very little is known about Lambert Simnel, including even the accuracy of those two names, before the age of about 10, when an Oxford-trained priest named Richard Symonds or Simons removed the boy from his working-class family, adopted him as his ward, gave him a good education, and tutored him in courtly manners, apparently hoping to pass him off as a royal. The initial plan was to claim that the boy was Richard, Duke of York (just like Perkin Warbeck a few years later). But another young Yorkist heir, Edward, the Earl of Warwick (son of the Duke of Clarence, Edward IV's brother) had also been imprisoned in the Tower and disappeared, and Simons decided to imitate him instead. He ferried Simnel to Ireland, where The Great Earl (who had been installed as the Lord Deputy of Ireland by the Yorks) decided to support the pretense. \n In 1487 Simnel was carried through the streets of Dublin on the shoulders of a massive man called D'Arcy of Platten, taken to Christ Church Cathedral, and there crowned Edward VI. An Irish army, joined by a mostly Flemish army raised by the English Earl of Lincoln, invaded Lancashire and was defeated by the army of King Henry at the battle of Stoke on 16 June 1487. Instead of being executed, Simnel was put to work in the royal kitchen as a spit-turner. (Hence, it would seem, Stephen's fancy of the young pretender as a \"scullion,\" or menial kitchen servant, trailed by \"nans and sutlers,\" English serving maids and army provisioners.) The priest Simons was imprisoned for life. The Great Earl had remained behind in Ireland and was pardoned. When Warbeck came along seeking his support a few years later, he was much more cagey. King Henry's comment on the Warbeck conspiracy was, \"I suppose they will crown an ape next.\""

  "030029prixdeparis": {
    "note": " As he often does in this jocoserious book, Stephen takes his probing metaphysical thoughts in an absurdly comic direction, turning the idea of a mild \"Seadeath\" into an advertiser's pitch for a desirable new experience. His musing consideration of Homer's Odyssey, continued in the phrase \"Prix de Paris,\" gives way by complicated shades of ambiguity to the huckster's cry, \"Just you give it a fair trial,\" and his customers' hilarious testimonial, \"We enjoyed ourselves immensely.\"",
    "expandedNote": " Odysseus' death at sea, Gifford observes, stems from the prize of Paris in the sense that the Trojan War was set in motion by the Trojan prince's awarding of the apple of beauty to Aphrodite over Athena and Hera. Gifford does not mention that in fact two prizes were exchanged: the apple that Paris gave to Aphrodite, and Helen, whom Aphrodite promised to Paris as a bribe to induce him to choose her. This second prize, the queen whom Paris abducted from Sparta and took home to Troy, was the more immediate origin (the Aristotelian \"efficient cause,\" perhaps) of the war. \n Gifford brings Helen into the picture by noting that Stephen's following phrase, \"beware of imitations,\" may possibly refer to another version of the Paris-Helen story told by the ancient Greek poet Stesichorus, in which \"only a ghost, or 'imitation,' of Helen went to Troy with Paris, while the real Helen remained faithful to Menelaus and sat out the Trojan War under the protection of King Proteus of Egypt.\" If Stephen is thinking of this alternate telling, the Greeks would have done well to \"beware of imitations.\" \n Regardless of the precise contours of Stephen's recollection of ancient Greek myths, a second layer of meaning is developing as he thinks these phrases. The Grand Prix de Paris, Gifford notes, was an immense cash award (250,000 francs in 1904) awarded annually to the horse that won France's biggest race. Sitting in Mr. Deasy's study in Nestor, Stephen has contemplated a portrait of \"the duke of Beaufort's Ceylon\" who won the prize in 1866. The prize of Paris, then, morphs in his imagination from a momentous classical exchange to a modern chance to get rich quick. \n Gravity declines further with \"beware of imitations\" and \"Just you give it a fair trial,\" which takes us from the splendor of rich men's thoroughbreds to the banality of advertisers' pitches for life-enhancing products. The punchline, \"We enjoyed ourselves immensely,\" is quite funny. Homer was right! Death by drowning is quite delightful! Try it yourselves and your family can be as happy as ours now is!\n [2019] Declan Kiberd offers the interesting observation that later in the novel Bloom too will think of drowning as a good way to go, \"one of the many affinities of which the two remain unconscious through the day.\" There is more: \"Stephen's ironic composure of an advertisement for drowning might be similarly viewed as an anticipation of the consciousness of the ad-canvasser Bloom.\" As with the scene in Ithaca in which Stephen imagines an ad for the Queen's Hotel, Joyce seems to be exploring the overlap between writing ads and writing fiction."

    "note": " Hades opens with a funeral cortège heading to \"the cemetery.\" Nearly halfway through the chapter, \"The high railings of Prospect\" are seen through the carriage windows, and at the very midpoint \"the gates\" are first mentioned. The coffin is borne through them and the mourners follow. The second half of the chapter takes place in Prospect Cemetery, a place with rich historical significance for Irish Catholics. It is located on \"Finglas Road\" in the near northwest suburb of Glasnevin.",
    "expandedNote": " The first photograph shows the \"high railings\" and, in front of them, \"the curbstone\" on Finglas Road against which the \"felly\" (the metal rim of a wheel) of the carriage scrapes, as well as \"the gates\" and the Hiberno-Romanesque \"mortuary chapel\" in which Father Coffey gives Dignam the last rites. \n J. J. McCarthy, Ireland's leading architect of Catholic churches in the mid-19th century, designed both the gates and the chapel, which were constructed in the 1870s. The chapel is a handsome building, but Bloom takes no interest in the architecture, thinking only, \"Chilly place this,\" and, \"Looks full up of bad gas. Must be an infernal lot of bad gas round the place.\" \n The construction of the Glasnevin Cemetery, as it has come to be called, addressed a crying need. The draconian Penal Laws of the 18th century had outlawed Catholic cemeteries and public performances of Catholic religious rites. Catholics were forced to bury their dead in Protestant cemeteries with heavily redacted versions of the funeral mass. When even these truncated ceremonies seemed threatened after a Protestant sexton inveighed against one in 1823, Daniel O'Connell agitated for the establishment of a cemetery where people of all denominations could be buried with full religious dignity. \n The new facility opened in 1832, and generations of heroic Irish nationalists have since been buried there: O'Connell himself, Charles Stewart Parnell, Arthur Griffith, Maud Gonne, Michael Collins, James Larkin, Jennie Wyse Power, and many more. Quoting from p. 321 of D. A. Chart's The Story of Dublin (1907), Gifford observes that the cemetery is the \"open air Parthenon or Westminster Abbey of Catholic and Nationalist Ireland\" (104). Hades pays attention to \"the chief's grave\" (that of Parnell) and to the \"lofty cone\" erected over the grave of O'Connell. \n The chapter also glances at \"the cardinal's mausoleum,\" a monument erected in the memory of Edward MacCabe, Archbishop of Dublin from 1879 until his death in 1885. The Vatican made him a cardinal in 1882. Gifford says of MacCabe that \"From an Irish point of view he was a 'townsman,' with little interest in land reform or Home Rule, the two central political issues of his time.\" A prone sculpture of the cardinal, tended at the head and feet by four ministering angels, tops the sarcophagus within the monument.\n As Bloom stands beside Dignam's grave, he thinks of \"Mine over there towards Finglas, the plot I bought. Mamma, poor mamma, and little Rudy.\" He will be buried next to his mother and his son, then, far from his father's grave in Ennis, County Clare. The village of Finglas (now a fully surrounded suburb) lies several miles northwest of the cemetery."

  "030000proteus": {
    "note": " Episode 3, called \"Proteus\" in the schemas, takes place between the hours of 11 AM and noon. It is a dazzling performance, but the text poses extraordinary challenges for readers. Stephen Dedalus is alone here, doing nothing but walking on the tide flats of Dublin Bay, so the interior monologue that supplemented the narrative and dialogue of the first two chapters balloons to occupy nearly all of the text. Linati's schema identifies the episode's \"technic\" as \"soliloquy,\" while Gilbert's says that it is \"monologue (male).\" Readers are alone with what Telemachus has called Stephen's \"rare thoughts,\" and must work hard to follow along. They may also struggle to make sense of the Homeric analogy, whose outlines are much less clear than in the first two chapters. The central concern is protean flux: the distressing impermanence of all earthly things, against which the human mind wages perpetual war.",
    "expandedNote": " In Book 4 of Homer's Odyssey Telemachus has traveled from Nestor's palace in Pylos to the hall of Menelaus in Sparta, seeking information about his father. Menelaus tells him that his journey back from Troy was interrupted when his ships were becalmed off the sandy island of Pharos, north of Egypt. Ignorant of which god might have stilled the winds, and facing starvation, Menelaus was assisted by the nymph Eidothea, daughter of the sea god Proteus. She told him that the Old Man of the Sea might answer his question, if Menelaus could capture him on the beach during his resting hour at noon and hold him fast while he assumed the shapes \"of all the beasts, and water, and blinding fire.\" Following her advice, Menelaus ambushed Proteus when he arrived to nap among his seals on the sand, endured the transformations, and was rewarded with information about the winds. He learned also of Odysseus' whereabouts on Calypso's island. \n Joyce's chapter does not allude to Menelaus or Eidothea, and it makes no reference to Proteus until very near the end, when Stephen thinks briefly of \"Old Father Ocean.\" It does develop the parallels with Telemachus. Stephen too has continued journeying, from Deasy's school south of the Sandycove tower to the Sandymount beach north of it. Stephen thinks about his plan to meet Mulligan at \"the Ship\" at 12:30 (the ambush planned by Antinous in Book 4), and he resolves not to return to the tower (affirming his sense of usurpation). He thinks briefly of his quest for spiritual fatherhood, and both he and Kevin Egan observe that he resembles Simon Dedalus, just as Telemachus resembles Odysseus. At the end of the chapter he sees \"a silent ship\" floating into Dublin on the tide, \"homing,\" which suggests Odysseus' stealthy return to Ithaca. \n But by far the most powerfully suggestive analogue to Homer's story lies in Stephen's restless, relentless meditations on change. Everything around him is in flux: the incoming tide, the changing weather, rotting and rusting objects, burping sewage gases, people and animals and ships and breezes passing by. Language, his medium for contemplating the world, is constantly shifting as English gives way to French, Latin, Italian, German, Irish, Scottish, Spanish, Greek, Hebrew, and 17th century gypsy \"cant.\" Memories flood in, taking him to Paris, the slums of Dubin, his aunt's house in Irishtown, Clongowes Wood College, the Howth tram, the Sandycove tower, churches, an antiquarian library, a bookstore. Imagination takes him to scenes of starvation, war, exile, and political intrigue through all the long centuries. Stephen's internal landscape too is shot through with change. He replays past follies and pretensions and obsessions and temptations, personal connections that have helped make him who he is, an imaginary doppelgänger, another self in a past life, another self on a distant planet.\n The human fear of change is rooted in the fact that life itself is a transitory phenomenon whose accomplishments, joys, and satisfactions are threatened by inevitable extinction. The third of Leopold Bloom's chapters, a journey to the graveyard, represents Bloom's unsentimental, irreligious contemplation of mortality. The thoughts in Stephen's third chapter are very similar. Everywhere he looks he sees death: the shells of former sea creatures crunching beneath his shoes, a dog rotting on the seaweed, the corpse of a drowned man surfacing from its ocean grave, a midwife's bag containing a dead fetus, bits of wood from the wrecked Spanish Armada, whales stranded on the beach, Viking rampages, a murdered post office worker, a buried mother. \n It might be argued that all the changes filling Stephen's consciousness align him with the Proteus of Homer's poem. But the Linati schema associates Proteus with \"Prima materia,\" the stuff that Stephen is wrestling with, and identifying him with Proteus would not take account of his struggle to find answers. He seems more like Menelaus in his search for enduring truths amid the flux. His first word, \"ineluctable,\" implies a desire to struggle out of the illusions of the sensorium into apprehensions of absolute reality. He searches for Boehmian mystical signatures, Berkeleyan ideal signs, Blakean primal faculties, the Christian divine substance, the Edenic paradise, the Aristotelian \"form of forms,\" the \"word known to all men\" that is love. He seeks the meaning of a prophetic dream, rejects attachments that smack of suffocation or entropy, rebukes himself for the egotistical delusions and false hopes he has pursued. He yearns to be loved, to be properly known, to accomplish the artistic work that he is capable of. \n This thread of scrutinizing, aspiring, determined spiritual search ties the chapter together, and although Stephen does not acquire definitive answers as Menelaus does, he does enact something like Menelaus' successful struggle. He stares down his depressing family connections, his morbid fear of water, his physical cowardice, his continuing attachment to Catholic religion, his social and artistic pretensions, his misogynistic distance from women, his alienation from all others. A mood of hopefulness infuses the chapter, and becomes stronger as it proceeds. It is the hope of someone who can comically and freely accept the world as it is. In beginning to see the adult he may become, Stephen is both Menelaus holding fast to his vision of the god, and Telemachus growing into Odyssean maturity.\n As with Nestor, Joyce's two schemas disagree on the time frame for Proteus, but in this case it is possible to affirm one over the other. The 10:00 start specified in the Linati schema probably would not allow Stephen enough time even to finish his meeting with Deasy, much less to travel all the way from Dalkey to Sandymount Strand. And several details in the text suggest that the hour of noon is approaching. The Gilbert schema, having been composed later, may here reflect Joyce's growing understanding of the temporal dimensions of his own fiction."

  "050048pubs": {
    "note": " After passing by Larry O'Rourke's in Calypso and conceiving his \"puzzle\" about crossing Dublin, Bloom leaves home for the day in Lotus Eaters and immediately finds himself thinking of \"pubs\" once again, this time when he imagines a young boy perpetually waiting for his alcoholic father to emerge from them. In addition to suggesting the sheer number of these establishments in Dublin, Ulysses gives a vivid sense of what a crucial role they play in the social life of the city, for good and for ill.",
    "expandedNote": " The profusion of public houses, or \"licensed premises\" for drinking, in Dublin was (and is) by no means atypical for Ireland. In Have Ye No Homes to Go to?: The History of the Irish Pub (Collins Books, 2016), Kevin Martin quotes from a speech that temperance leader William Lawson delivered to the Irish Temperance Society in 1902. Lawson noted that, in 1845, the country had 15,000 public-house licenses for a population of 8 million, but in 1902 there were 19,000 licenses for only 4 million people. Anticipating Bloom's remark about Dublin, Lawson quoted someone from Tralee as having told him, \"If a man was blindfolded and put standing in the centre of the street, and spun around a couple of times and started off in no particular direction, he could not go twenty yards without striking a public house.\" \n Even a novel as encyclopedic as Ulysses can hardly do justice to such a profusion of watering holes, but it makes a noble effort. The number of pubs featured in the novel, not counting hotels and restaurants that served alcohol and the many \"wine and spirit\" shops that may or may not have had a bar in the back, is huge. This list, with numbers referring to chapters in which the pubs are mentioned, is doubtless incomplete: \n The Ship, 5 Lower Abbey Street (1, 3, 17) \n Larry O'Rourke's, now Eccles Townhouse, 74 Upper Dorset Street (4)\n Dan Tallon's, 46 George's Street South and 57 Stephen Street (4)\n (James) Conway's, now Kennedy's, 31-32 Westland Row (5)\n The Arch, 32 Henry Street (5)\n Brian Boroimhe House, now Brian Boru Pub, 1 Prospect Terrace (6)\n Dunphy's (Corner), now Doyle's Corner, 160-161 Phibsborough Road (6)\n The Oval, still in business at 78 Middle Abbey Street (7)\n Meagher's, 4 Earl Street North (7, 13)\n (J. and T.) Davy's, 110A-111 Upper Leeson Street (7)\n Mooney's (\"en ville\"), now Madigan's, 1 Lower Abbey Street (7, 11, 15)\n The Scotch House, 6-7 Burgh Quay (8, 10, 12)\n (Andrew) Rowe's, 2 Great George's Street South (8)\n (T. J.) Manning's, 41 Upper Abbey Street (8)\n (Michael) Doran's, 10 Molesworth Street (8)\n Davy Byrne's, still in business at 21 Duke Street (8, 17)\n (P.) John Long's, 52 Dawson Street (8)\n Daniel Bergin's, 17 North Strand Road (10)\n (James) Kavanagh's, now the Turk's Head, 27 Parliament Street (10)\n (William) Crimmins', now the Malt House, 27-28 James's Street (10)\n Ruggy O'Donohoe's, 23 Wicklow Street (10)\n Tunney's, now The Oarsman, 8 Bridge Street, Ringsend (10, 15)\n (Gerald) Mooney's (\"sur mer\"), 3 Eden Quay (11, 15)\n Keogh's, possibly at 32 Upper Erne Street (11)\n Barney (Bernard) Kiernan's, 8-10 Little Britain Street (12, 17)\n (John) Power's, 18 Cope Street (12)\n (William) Slattery's, 28 Great Ship Street (12)\n Donohoe's (and Smyth's), 4-5 Little Green Street (12)\n (John) Burke's, 17 Holles Street (14)\n The Moira House, Trinity Street & Dame Lane (15)\n The Signal House, now J. & M. Cleary's, 36 Amiens Street (16)\n The Dock Tavern, 1 Store Street (16)\n The Brazen Head Hotel, still in business at 20 Lower Bridge Street (16)\n The Bleeding Horse, Camden Street (16)\n The Old Ireland Hotel and Tavern, 10 North Wall Quay (16)\n Other works by Joyce feature some of these houses, as well as others not mentioned in Ulysses. Farrington's pub crawl in \"Counterparts,\" for instance, takes him from Davy Byrne's to the Scotch House, and thence to \"Mulligan's of Poolbeg Street,\" a pub which is still in business and proudly touting its Joyce connection. By one reading of Finnegans Wake, everything in the book takes place in the Mullingar House in Chapelizod, where John Stanislaus Joyce drank away most of the money he earned for three years as secretary to a distilling company. HCE, according to the narrative, \"owns the bulgiest bung-barrel that ever was tip-tapped in the privace of the Mullingar Inn.\" \n Many of the chapters in Ulysses show men (and only men) either gathering in such establishments, or planning to do so, or recollecting recent visits. Mulligan plans to meet Stephen at the Ship, but Stephen instead drinks with his gang of pressmen at Mooney's. Bloom imagines that the Dignam mourners will stop for drinks after the funeral at Dunphy's, as the Citizen and his cronies do during the afternoon at Barney Kiernan's, and as Stephen and his medical friends do late at night in Burke's. Bloom takes his lunch with a glass of wine at Davy Byrne's, and Tom Kernan downs a couple of glasses of gin at Mr. Crimmin's. Other drinking establishments that figure in the day's events—the Ormond Hotel bar in Sirens, the doctors' commons in the National Maternity Hospital in Oxen of the Sun—are not technically pubs but feel like it, given the boisterous camaraderie they foster. \n Joyce enjoyed pubs as much as his father did, and the consoling presence of these comfortable establishments in every corner of the city radiates through the pages of Ulysses.But the novel also glances, again and again, at the social costs of a culture of omnipresent alcoholic availability. The encouragement of excessive consumption by men \"treating\" each other to successive rounds of drinks, the unusually high rate of alcoholism, the occasional outbursts of violence, the interruption of work and ruination of careers, the impoverishment of families, the estrangement of men and women, the incapacitations and premature deaths: all of these effects are documented in the novel, most of them repeatedly. By choosing a protagonist who appreciates the effects of alcoholic inebriation but never indulges it to excess, Joyce envisioned a path of moderation that he had scant success practicing in his own life."

  "070016littlepuff": {
    "note": " In a chapter full of references to wind, Bloom uses the word \"puff\" to describe what his client, Alexander Keyes, wants in return for renewing a recurring ad in the Freeman's Journal: \"he practically promised he'd give the renewal. But he wants just a little puff. What will I tell him, Mr Crawford?\" He seems to be referring to Keyes' request that the publisher run a short paragraph in the Evening Telegraph, a sister newspaper operated from the same offices on Prince's Street. But Keyes also wants some input into the appearance of the Freeman ad—which too might count as a puff.",
    "expandedNote": "In addition to other kinds of inflated speech, the OED notes that, since the 17th century, \"puff\" (as a noun, but similarly as a verb) has referred to \"Undue or inflated praise or commendation, uttered or written in order to influence public estimation; an extravagantly laudatory advertisement or review of a book, a performer or performance, a tradesman's goods, or the like.\" Such uses have stayed current throughout the modern era. In a 12 October 2015 article on The New Statesman website, Ross Wilson states that “a literary puff is the promotional blurb that appears on book jackets and publishers’ press releases . . . Getting to put 'Booker Prize Winner' and, perhaps, a puff from the panel of judges on your dust-jacket is priceless.”\n Bloom tells Crawford that Keyes \"wants a par to call attention in the Telegraph too, the Saturday pink.\" Presumably this free plug would consist of a paragraph mentioning or praising the merchant's business. Earlier in Aeolus, as Bloom discusses Keyes' ad with a Freeman official, Red Murray, Murray has told him, \"Of course, if he wants a par . . . we can do him one.\" Bloom has run this idea past the paper's foreman, Joseph Patrick Nannetti—\"just a little par calling attention. You know the usual. Highclass licensed premises. Longfelt want. So on\"—and Nannetti has agreed. Now he tries to get buy-in from the editor of the Telegraph: \"if I can get the design I suppose it's worth a short par. He'd give the ad, I think.\"\n For more than a century there has been a trend of blurring together news, entertainment, and advertising. In an article titled \"Ads Masquerading as Journalism\" (CBC News, 4 February 2015), Neil Macdonald refers to this blended form of media as \"branded content.\" Others might use the word hype. A short history of advertising on the site Ad Age notes that, by 1900, “ads became a single component of planned campaigns that had to be integrated into appropriate marketing strategies. Skilled copywriting, layout and illustration became important in achieving continuity and strengthening selling appeals. . . . The role of the account exec expanded from bringing in new business to serving as a liaison between the client and the creative staff, while media buyers continued to see that the ads were placed in the best possible location and shopped for the best possible deals.” \n Bloom works for a newspaper rather than an ad agency, but he is taking on some of this new role of liaison between client, media outlet, and creative design. He appears to be in the vanguard of attentiveness to modern forms of media saturation, just as his own thoughts often fall victim to the bombardment of commercial messages he encounters throughout the city. In addition to pushing the idea of parallel mentions in two newspapers, he is involved in an effort to see that the Freeman ad can fulfill the creative \"design\" that Keyes desires: \"Two crossed keys here. A circle. Then here the name. Alexander Keyes, tea, wine, and spirit merchant. So on. . . . Then round the top in leaded: the house of keys.\" \n His modest request for client control and branded content is too much for the old-fashioned editor Crawford, who replies, “He can kiss my ass.” Bloom braces himself: “A bit nervy. Look out for squalls.” His request for a little puff ends with the threat of violent squalls. \n Interestingly, the kinds of promotional co-branding represented in Aeolus played a significant part in the marketplace reception of Ulysses. Aaron Jaffe observes, in Modernism and the Culture of Celebrity (Cambridge UP, 2005), that the notoriety surrounding the publication of Ulysses was used to advance the careers of other modernist writers, such as T.S. Eliot: “In the October 1922 Dial, the issue preceding the Waste Land number, the editors puff Eliot’s coming attractions with a comparison to Ulysses, which comes out of this context: ‘It is not improbable that the appearance of The Waste Land will rank with that of Ulysses in the degree of interest it will call forth’” (73). Jaffe argues that not only editors but also writers like Joyce, Eliot, and Pound worked to promote one another's reputations and \"puff\" the modernist movement in literature."

  "010059pulsesbeating": {
    "note": " \"Sea and headland now grew dim. Pulses were beating in his eyes, veiling their sight, and he felt the fever of his cheeks.\" The American idiom “seeing red” probably comes from the experience of having adrenaline-charged blood rush through vessels in the eyeball. Intense anger can also produce a \"fever\" of blood in the cheeks, similar to the blush of embarrassment that has just suffused Mulligan's cheeks when confronted with his harsh words about Stephen and his mother's death: \"A flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck Mulligan's cheek.\"",
    "expandedNote": " But Stephen's physical passion is rooted in more depth of feeling and more understanding of personal dynamics. Mulligan is aware only of having committed a social impropriety: \"I didn't mean to offend the memory of your mother.\" Stephen is angry because of something else, \"the offence to me\" created by his friend's callous indifference to his suffering.\n Mulligan defends himself at length against what he thinks to be Stephen's anger at hearing his mother described as “beastly dead.” But between two freethinking men such a description should not be particularly disturbing; indeed, it is easy to imagine that someone raging at the loss of a loved one would sympathize with such a blunt statement. Saying “it’s only Dedalus,” however, is virtually certain to wound and antagonize. A person wrestling with grief feels acute narcissistic self-absorption: the foundations of life have collapsed, and yet the world somehow goes on all around, unconsciously, cruelly. To have one’s importance callously dismissed in such a state is maddening. Mulligan does it to an ostensibly close friend. He cannot understand why Stephen's feelings would be hurt, and he compounds the injury by going on the offensive and exploiting Stephen's guilt about how he treated his mother. All these actions betray a breathtaking unconsciousness and indifference. \n In the schemas which Joyce gave to Carlo Linati and Valery Larbaud, a bodily organ is associated with each episode of the book, with the exception of Stephen's chapters: Telemachus, Nestor, Proteus. The usual interpretation of this omission (almost certainly valid) is that Stephen, unlike Bloom, lives almost entirely in his head, and not in his body. There are limits to the validity of the insight, however. The pulses in Stephen's eyes, the fever in his cheeks, and \"the gaping wounds\" that Mulligan's words tear in his heart, show a man who, at this moment at least, is living very intensely and unhappily in his body. Mulligan, for all his athletic, hedonistic wellbeing, does not have a clue about the grief, love, and sympathy that a healthily embodied person feels."

  "030151punchedtickets": {
    "note": " In Proteus Stephen thinks that he \"used to carry punched tickets to prove an alibi if they arrested you for murder somewhere. Justice. On the night of the seventeenth of February 1904 the prisoner was seen by two witnesses. Other fellow did it: other me. Hat, tie, overcoat, nose. Lui, c’est moi. You seem to have enjoyed yourself.\" The perforated tickets are probably for the theatre, to show he spent an evening in public view, because the date that Stephen gives coincides with a newpaper report of a French play about mistaken identity.",
    "expandedNote": " On 17 February 1904 the Irish Independent reported on an English version of a French play about a man wrongfully accused of murder. The Arm of the Law, which became a major hit at the Garrick in London starting in mid-February 1904, translated a French original, La Robe Rouge. Might Joyce have seen the original in Paris? \"You seem to have enjoyed yourself\" suggests that he may have done so, which would reward anyone who discovers the 17 February 1904 newspaper reference. \n The red robe of the French title refers to achieving the role of prosecuting advocate. In the drama, an innocent man is accused, and his wife, under cross-examination as she tries to help her husband, discloses that she previously had an affair, unknown to him. The husband is acquitted but repudiates his spouse for her infidelity and takes their children with him. She takes revenge by murdering the prosecutor with a knife, thus committing the crime of which her husband was innocent. Given Joyce’s fascination with uxorial betrayal (in real life as in Ulysses), this play would seem to make perfect fodder for his art. Stephen's \"punched tickets\" anticipate the torn-up betting tickets that Bloom finds in his home in Ithaca, which suggest Molly's unprofessional engagement with Boylan.\n Wrongful accusation too is a major theme in Ulysses, and this is its first appearance. In Circe, Bloom too imagines himself being “Wrongfully accused” in connection with a theatrical production, The Lyons Mail, which tells the story of a man who was arrested and executed for murder because he looked very much like one of the accomplices in the crime. As Stephen says, in words that strikingly evoke that other play, \"Other fellow did it: other me. Hat, tie, overcoat, nose. Lui, c’est moi.\""

  "070021putusall": {
    "note": " When Myles Crawford, in Aeolus, tries to interest Stephen in writing something for the press, he suggests that he could \"Put us all into it.\" When Bloom thinks in Eumaeus of writing something for a newspaper as Philip Beaufoy has done, he thinks of presenting \"a miniature cameo of the world we live in.\" Both journalistic moments predict the great novel that Joyce unveiled in 1922: a fiction that would give not only an encyclopedic account of human life but also a densely specific recreation of 1904 Dublin and its people.",
    "expandedNote": " Glancing with \"scornful invective\" at the sorts of tripe he must shepherd into print—\"Foot and mouth disease!\" (\"All balls!\"), \"Great nationalist meeting in Borris-in-Ossory\" (\"Bulldosing the public!\")—the editor asks Stephen for something bigger: \"Give them something with a bite in it. Put us all into it, damn its soul. Father, Son and Holy Ghost and Jakes M'Carthy.\" His quotidian palaver about the Holy Trinity evokes the theological concerns that Joyce incarnated in Ulysses. Oceans of ink have been spilled on Bloom as a spiritual Father, Stephen as his consubstantial Son, and Molly as a Spirit hovering between them. Against this hyper-symbolic dimension of the novel, Crawford's words also anticipate its hyper-concrete reproduction of Dublin life. Jakes M'Carthy, an actual newspaperman, stands in for the hundreds of real people (now detailed in Vivien Igoe's The Real People of Joyce's Ulysses) that Joyce included in his novel. When Ulysseswas first published, the city was reportedly abuzz with people asking one another, \"Are you in it?\"—a striking fulfillment of Crawford's prophecy. \n As he sits across from Stephen in the cabman's shelter, Bloom is thinking of something he might write. Having discovered a kind of mental consubstantiality with Stephen (this Fatherly thought has not yet occurred to the Son), he sees the two of them sitting at the center of a galaxy of people, places, and events: \"Added to which was the coincidence of meeting, discussion, dance, row, old salt, of the here today and gone tomorrow type, night loafers, the whole galaxy of events, all went to make up a miniature cameo of the world we live in, especially as the lives of the submerged tenth, viz., coalminers, divers, scavengers, etc., were very much under the microscope lately. To improve the shining hour he wondered whether he might meet with anything approaching the same luck as Mr Philip Beaufoy if taken down in writing. Suppose he were to pen something out of the common groove (as he fully intended doing) at the rate of one guinea per column, My Experiences, let us say, in a Cabman's Shelter.\"\n The demimondains surrounding him, thinks Bloom, constitute an underrepresented slice of Dublin life which readers might like to hear about. And the cabstand might serve as the setting for a short fiction suggesting that these people are representative of something larger. Scaled up, this modest literary ambition would produce Ulysses, which represents the gritty particulars of an impoverished colonial capital and finds enduring realities of the human condition in the lives lived there. Ulysses is no \"cameo,\" though. It is a microcosm of \"the world we live in\": a compendious demonstration that even the smallest, lowest, and most ordinary particulars of human experience encode cosmic truths.\n Much American criticism has minimized the importance of the novel's representation of Dublin people and places, an approach which must never have made much sense to Dubliners. One American writer who bucked that trend early on, pointed out to me in a personal communication by Vincent Altman O'Connor, was Joseph Frank, the Dostoevsky biographer who was also a daring critical theorist influenced by Russian formalism. In Spatial Form in Modern Literature (1945) Frank argued that Joyce imagined a readership of Dubliners who would be thoroughly familiar with the people, places, and histories mentioned in Ulysses. Tossing out mere mentions of these particulars across hundreds of pages, the author expected readers to supply all the missing information, place the various pieces in context, and thereby contemplate the collective life of Dublin \"spatially,\" i.e. synchronically.\n For natives the task is relatively easy, since for them Dublin is already a single, organic entity. Relatively easy: the people of the book are now gone, the history more distant, and countless buildings demolished. Strangers must work much harder still to know Dublin, in the same way that they gain familiarity with all of Joyce's other unifying constructions: laboriously, piece by piece, with little sense at the outset that the totality could ever be held in mind simultaneously: \"unless one is a Dubliner, such knowledge can be obtained only after the book has been read and all the references fitted into their proper place and grasped as a unity.\" Frank remarks that \"Although the burdens placed on the reader by this method of composition may seem insuperable, the fact remains that Joyce, in his unbelievably laborious fragmentation of narrative structure, proceeded on the assumption that a unified spatial apprehension of his work would ultimately be possible.\"\n The end product, ideally, is \"a sense of Dublin as a totality, including all the relations of the characters to one another and all the events which enter their consciousness.\" After multiple explorations of the city represented in Ulysses(Frank perceptively noted that \"Joyce cannot be read—he can only be re-read\"), one can almost be said \"to become a Dubliner. For this is what Joyce demands; that the reader have at hand the same instinctive knowledge of Dublin life, the same sense of Dublin as a huge, surrounding organism, which the Dubliner possesses as a birthright.\""

  "020002pyrrhus": {
    "note": " According to Joyce's schemas, the \"Art\" of Nestor is history, and the chapter begins in the middle of a history lesson. Stephen asks the boys in his class, \"what city sent for him?,\" referring to Pyrrhus (318-272 BC), the Hellenistic-era Greek general who \"said: Another victory like that and we are done for. That phrase the world had remembered.\" His name lives on in the term \"Pyrrhic victory.\"",
    "expandedNote": " In 280 BC, Pyrrhus agreed to bring an army to the defense of \"Tarentum,\" a Greek colony in the instep of the boot of Italy, against the Roman armies that were poised to conquer Tarentum and the other cities of Magna Graecia. His victories at Heraclea (280) and \"Asculum\" (\"279 B.C.\") were very costly, and Plutarch recorded his saying that one more victory like Asculum would ruin him. Seven years later, when the Tarentines learned of Pyrrhus' death in a street battle in the ancient Greek city of Argos, they quickly surrendered to Rome. \n A bit later, Stephen thinks of \"the end of Pyrrhus\": \"Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam's hand in Argos.\" A woman of Argos, watching the confused fighting in the streets below her, threw down a roof tile which knocked Pyrrhus senseless. An Argive soldier then decapitated him.\n Nestor is about the tyranny of the past. Early in the episode Stephen thinks of Irish leaders that \"For them too history was a tale like any other too often heard, their land a pawnshop.\" Later he will say to his employer that \"History is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.\" Fittingly, the chapter opens with a scene of Irish schoolboys being instructed in the futility of a Greek general's resistance to the growing power of Rome. \n It is probably no accident that they are learning this lesson in a school run by an Anglo-Irish, ardently Unionist headmaster. Five chapters later, Aeolus will propose symbolic parallels linking Rome's supremacy over Greece with Great Britain's supremacy over Ireland. Mr. Deasy's curriculum, it may be argued, is indoctrinating Anglo-Irish boys in the necessity of submission to imperial power. It has also been argued that the hockey games played at the school are preparing the boys for military conflict, specifically the Great War that would chew up so many of the youth of Europe."

  "090004quakerlibrarian": {
    "note": " Thomas W. Lyster, \"the quaker librarian,\" was an actual Dubliner who served as director of the National Library from 1895 to 1920. At the time represented in the novel he was 49 years old. In 1883 Lyster published a scholarly translation of Heinrich Düntzer’s Life of Goethe—hence the reference that Joyce's character makes to Wilhelm Meister and the truth of \"Goethe's judgments\" at the beginning of Scylla and Charybdis. His highminded spiritualism flags him as an argumentative antagonist for Stephen, though he never opposes the young man's assertions.",
    "expandedNote": " Gifford notes that \"the oddity of his religious faith made him the object of suspicion and considerable mockery.\" Joyce's narrative seems to participate to some extent in this mocking curiosity: it refers to Lyster as \"the quaker librarian\" fully a dozen times (compared to only two instances in which an attendant addresses him as \"Mr Lyster\"), and twice as \"Quakerlyster\" (in Scylla when Shakespearean character tags are printed above speaking parts, and again in Circe). Stephen focuses on his piety—\"The quaker's pate godlily with a priesteen in booktalk\"—and wonders about his spiritual motivations: \"Alarmed face asks me. Why did he come? Courtesy or an inward light?\" \n In addition to the librarian's exotic faith, the episode irreverently calls attention several times to his \"pate,\" which is strikingly \"bald,\" and to his large ears. But it also shows the man's \"friendly and earnest\" nature. Lyster is unfailingly wellmeaning and helpful, repeatedly jumping up from the discussion to help the library's patrons (including Bloom) and never descending into the nastiness toward Stephen that Eglinton and Mulligan display. The narrative in Scylla sometimes associates the countenance and the kindness, as when it calls Lyster \"bald, eared and assiduous\" or says that \"The benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope.\"\n In the first chapter of his memoir As I Was Going Down Sackville Street, Oliver Gogarty has some fun with the librarian's shiny dome, but describes Lyster as \"a lovable man\" possessed of some whimsical wit. Over the course of six or seven pages Gogarty recalls the librarian talking about his daily duties. Lyster speaks of the \"direction\" that students require, lest they become ensnared by dangerous authors like Nietzsche. He prescribes a Kipling poem for an engineering student looking for a mathematics text, Browning for bank clerks, Paracelsus for medical students. He helps a Catholic priest in \"his struggles with the Fiend, his wrestlings with visions of lingerie, or rather with the thoughts which a lady's underclothing gave rise to.\" He invokes Greek terms to combat Christian heresies. His concern is to take readers into \"the higher realms and romantic fields,\" putting them in touch with \"the Universe,\" the \"starry bourne.\" Of whom does he remind Gogarty? \"I have it! Plato, of course.\" \n Gogarty's portrait makes Lyster seem less passive and retiring than Joyce's does. But from both texts one receives the same impression of highminded spirituality. Avatar of Plato or not, the librarian certainly keeps company with the Platonists against whom Stephen sharpens his Aristotelian dagger definitions."

  "010012quarterto": {
    "note": " At the end of Telemachus Stephen recalls words from the prayer for the dying in a peculiar way, clipping three phrases from the longer text: \"Liliata rutilantium. / Turma circumdet. / Iubilantium te virginum.\" At the end of Calypso Bloom does something similar, repeating a phrase three times on separate lines of the novel's text: \"Heigho! Heigho! / Heigho! Heigho! / Heigho! Heigho!\" Only after a reader carefully considers the second of these details can the first one make any sense. In separate locations, and filtered through dissimilar sensibilities, the two men must be hearing the same time of day announced by ringing bells. That time is \"Quarter to,\" 8:45 AM. Later chapters will show Stephen, Bloom, and Molly all hearing the time through the bells of St. George's church.",
    "expandedNote": " Before the era of omnipresent clocks and watches, many church and civic bell towers marked the time in quarter-hour intervals by playing the sequence called the Cambridge Quarters or Westminster Quarters, a melody that was written in 1793 for the clock in Great St. Mary's church at Cambridge University and adopted in 1859 for a new clock in the Big Ben tower of the Palace of Westminster. The melody uses four notes; in the original key of E major, they are B, E, F#, and G#. One strain of the melody, four notes long, is heard at 15 minutes past the hour. A different strain, with two four-note segments, signals the half hour. A still-longer group of three four-note segments signifies quarter till. The full hour is heard in a long melody of four four-note segments, followed by the tolling of a fifth bell, usually one octave down from the tonic note, to identify the hour: one strike for 1:00, two for 2:00, and so on. In the Westminster tower, Big Ben sounds these low notes.\n As he listens to the tolling of the \"loud dark iron\" bells in St. George's, Bloom superimposes his childish words on the four-note strains. \"Heigho! Heigho!\" (or Hi ho! Hi ho!) is a common refrain in nursery rhymes like Froggy Went A-Courtin', The Fox and the Farmer, The Farmer in the Dell, Oh Who is so Merry?, and A Pie Sat on a Pear Tree. Hearing it sound three times, Bloom infers that the time is \"Quarter to.\" Listening habitually for a fourth segment, he hears only an overtone: \"There again: the overtone following through the air, third.\" Reading backwards (retrospectively), a reader can infer that Stephen too must have been listening to bells in some church tower or civic hall in Kingstown at the end of Telemachus when he recalled phrases from the much more solemn Christian prayer. \n People making such minutely exact but unlikely connections between chapters may worry that they are reading too much into the text. But the novel relieves any anxiety of over-interpretation—and spurs slower wits to catch up—by reprising the two men's auditory reconstructions of the Westminster Quarters many chapters later. In Ithaca, as Stephen shakes Bloom's hand while leaving his back yard, a sound accompanies the action. What sound? \"The sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the bells in the church of Saint George.\" The playful cadence, so similar to the effect of The House That Jack Built, is entirely consistent with Bloom's habit of imposing a nursery-rhyme jingle on the Quarters. Sure enough, the narrative asks, \"What echoes of that sound were by both and each heard?\" and, for Bloom, the answer is \"Heigho, heigho, / Heigho, heigho.\" For Stephen, it is \"Liliata rutilantium. Turma circumdet. / Iubilantium te virginum. Chorus excipiat.\"\n This passage shows the two men listening to the same bells and playing their different auditory tapes, but now standing in one place. The effect is clearly to suggest that something similar was happening in the early chapters. Joyce disjoins his coterminous protagonists at the end of the day in the same way that he joined his divided protagonists at the beginning, as each left his home and headed off into the world. However, both intracranial versions of the bells' tune now occupy two lines of text, not three. The bells are sounding their Second Quarter, and the \"hour of the night\" appears to be 1:30 AM. \n In the final chapter of the novel, Molly too uses the bells to tell time, though she does not supply words to their melody: \"wait theres Georges church bells wait 3 quarters the hour l wait 2 oclock well thats a nice hour of the night for him to be coming home at.\" At the end ofCalypso Bloom heard three quarters and waited for a fourth four-note segment, but got only an \"overtone.\" Molly hears \"the hour,\" i.e., a fourth segment, and then, waiting, she hears two low bells signaling that it is 2:00 AM."

Of these three purveyors of popular entertainment the Queen's Theatre set its sights lowest, though for a time in the 1950s and 60s it housed the more prestigious Abbey Theatre. It closed its doors in 1969.",
    "expandedNote": " The Queen's Royal Theatre, commonly called the Queen's, opened in 1844. In the following decades it often staged Irish melodramas, written by Dion Boucicault and others. In HadesBloom thinks of attending a musical version of Boucicault's Colleen Bawn: \"Or the Lily of Killarney? Elster Grimes Opera company.\" The theater also produced countless flimsy plays on Irish figures like St. Patrick, Wolfe Tone, and Robert Emmet. In his foreword to Joseph O'Brien's Dear, Dirty Dublin (1982), Hugh Kenner calls the \"endless minor plays on Irish historical themes\" the equivalent of westerns in 20th century America (ix). \n By the end of the 19th century the theater was staging Victorian precursors of what came to be known as \"variety shows,\" with assorted acts predominantly musical and comical. The quality of some of these can be gauged by the Cyclops narrator's description of the Citizen \"shouting like a stuck pig, as good as any bloody play in the Queen's royal theatre.\" As variety theater supplanted music-hall shows in the mid-20th century, the Queen's led the way with acts like the Happy Gang, a group of comedians and musicians. \n From 1951 to 1966 the Abbey Theatre Company took over the building after its own theater burned down. But as Philip B. Ryan observes in his The Lost Theatres of Dublin (1998), these fifteen years marked a very low ebb in the ambitions of Ireland's famous art theater. By the end of the Abbey's uninspiring run, variety shows had largely been killed off by television, and the Queen's lasted for only a few more years. In 1975 it was demolished to make way for a modern office building, just as the Theatre Royal had been in the 1960s."

Inside Mulligan's shoe is a \"foot I dislove. But you were delighted when Esther Osvalt's shoe went on you: girl I knew in Paris. Tiens, quel petit pied!\" The French means, \"Look, what a small foot!\" \n From such a master of verisimilitude as Joyce proves himself in Ulysses, \"girl I knew in Paris\" is disconcerting.

  "090012brogue": {
    "note": " Having encountered one small storm of Hiberno-English from Josie Breen in Lestrygonians, readers weather a denser cell in Scylla and Charybdis when Buck Mulligan launches into several sentences of \"querulous brogue.\" Joyce intimates that the whole performance mimics the language of John Millicent Synge's plays, and it is an effective parody, but the vocabulary is Mulligan's own eclectic concoction of Irish, Hiberno-English, and obscure English expressions.",
    "expandedNote": " § Gifford observes that \"Synge created a [ahem!] singularly poetic and dramatic language out of the peculiar combination of Irish syntax and archaic English diction\" that he heard spoken in County Wicklow and the west of Ireland. His one-act play Riders to the Sea was first performed in Dublin starting in late February 1904. It is fair to suppose that when Joyce penned Mulligan's mocking imitation of Irish speech he was thinking primarily of Riders to the Sea and even suggesting that Mulligan has attended a Dublin performance of this play and has its lines ringing in his ears. The narrative introduces his sentences by saying that he \"keened in a querulous brogue,\" and the play is all about keening. Slightly later in Scylla, when Stephen invokes Thomas Aquinas, Mulligan reprises his mourning (\"he keened a wailing rune\") and repeats nearly verbatim what one of the characters of Riders says as she begins to keen: \"It's destroyed we are from this day! It's destroyed we are surely!\" \n Most English-speakers have some awareness of keening as a high-pitched wailing lamentation for the dead, but they may not recognize it as an ancient Irish practice or know that the word is an Anglicization of the Irish verb caoin. Set on one of the Aran Islands, in the Gaeltacht, Riders to the Sea stages the story of Maurya, who has lost a husband and five sons to the sea. Her daughters Cathleen and Nora receive word that a body which may be that of their brother Michael has washed up on the coast of Donegal. It does prove to be Michael, and by the end of the play the sea also claims Bartley, the one remaining son. All three broken-hearted women keen their ruinous losses, which may well bring them to the brink of starvation. By contrast, Mulligan's mournful wailing is sparked by the fact that Stephen did not show up at the Ship to buy him drinks. The word \"querulous\" means \"complaining, peevish, plaintive.\" One imagines Mulligan adopting one of his old-woman voices, perhaps some variant of Mother Grogan's, to press his countrified, wheedling, whining complaint.\n § The word \"brogue\" is a familiar name for English spoken with an Irish accent. But like \"keen\" it derives from an Irish word: either bróg = shoe (a word that appears several times in Ulysses) or barróg = speech defect. Dolan notes a possible connection between the two, though this etymology is contested: \"There is a view that Irish people used to speak English unintelligibly (as a result of linguistic contamination from Irish syntax and vocabulary), and the effect was as if they had a shoe on their tongue.\" When Joyce writes in Finnegans Wake that HCE's \"sbrogue cunneth none lordmade undersiding,\" he seems to be playing with this notion that thick-tongued Hiberno-English speech can be hard to understand.\n The brogue that flows from Mulligan's mouth is indeed hard to understand in many particulars, though its general intention is clear enough:\n It's what I'm telling you,mister honey, it's queer and sick we were, Haines and myself, the time himself brought it in. 'Twas murmur we did for a gallus potion would rouse a friar, I'm thinking, and he limp with leching. And we one hour and two hours and three hours in Connery's sitting civil waiting for pints apiece. \n He wailed: \n — And we to be there, mavrone, and you to be unbeknownst sending us your conglomerations the way we to have our tongues out a yard long like the drouthy clerics do be fainting for a pussful.\n Stephen laughed.\n § The passage paints a simple comic scene of Mulligan and Haines sitting in the pub, painfully waiting for Stephen (as Synge's women wait for news), and receiving only a telegram (\"it\"). The syntax and verbal delivery echo Synge's representation of the Aran islanders' lilting speech. Using a reflexive pronoun as a subject, for example (\"himself brought it in\"), is a linguistic practice used often in the play (\"Herself does be saying prayers half through the night\"), as is the insistent use of \"it\" (\"If it wasn’t found itself, that wind is raising the sea, and there was a star up against the moon, and it rising in the night. If it was a hundred horses, or a thousand horses you had itself, what is the price of a thousand horses against a son where there is one son only?\"). \n \"And we to be there\" imitates the islanders' distinctive use of conjunctions (\"How would it be washed up, and we after looking each day for nine days\"). Another such idiom involving \"way\" (\"the way we can put the one flannel on the other\") shows up in Mulligan's \"the way we to have our tongues out.\" \"I'm thinking\" too recalls the speech of the play (\"I’m thinking it won't be long,\" \"I'm thinking Bartley put it on him in the morning\"). Even Mulligan's counting of the hours (\"And we one hour and two hours and three hours\") echoes the islanders' speech (\"I’ll have half an hour to go down, and you’ll see me coming again in two days, or in three days, or maybe in four days if the wind is bad\"). \n § More such echoes could be cited, but this note will highlight just one other that is heard often in Irish speech. Commenting on the churchmen that Mulligan says \"do be fainting\" for a drink, Slote cites P. W. Joyce: \"In the Irish language (but not in English) there is what is called the consuetudinal tense, i.e. denoting habitual action or existence. It is a very convenient tense, so much so that the Irish, feeling the want of it in their English, have created one by use of the word do with be: 'I do be at my lessons every evening from 8 to 9 o'clock'.\" \n This kind of verbal construction is not completely absent from the English spoken in England: there, people sometimes use the future tense to imply habitual action, saying that boys will be boys or clerics will be drinking. But the Irish way is much more vivid. Many examples can be found in Synge's plays, including a few in Riders to the Sea: \"the black hags that do be flying on the sea,\" \"In the big world the old people do be leaving things after them for their sons and children, but in this place it is the young men do be leaving things behind for them that do be old.\" Characters speak in this way at several other points in Ulysses. In Lestrygonians Nosey Flynn tells the story of a woman who hid in a clock in the Masons' hall to discover \"what they do be doing,\" and Bloom imagines a constable pressing a servant girl with the question, \"And who is the gentleman does be visiting there?\" In Wandering Rocks Patsy Dignam thinks of \"One of them mots that do be in the packets of fags Stoer smokes.\"\n While the syntactic rhythms of Mulligan's keening are clearly derived from reading or listening to Synge, the vocabulary is his own, and it far outdoes Synge for obscurity. Riders to the Sea employs no words more unfamiliar than \"poteen\" (Irish moonshine) or \"Samhain\" (a pagan Gaelic fall festival). Mulligan leads off with \"mister honey,\" which no commentator has even directly addressed, much less satisfactorily explained. In a personal communication, Senan Molony argues that this must be a playful anglicization of some Irish phrase. He offers one possibility: más é do thoil é, literally \"if it is your will,\" or figuratively \"if you please.\" Spoken quickly, as this very long way of saying \"please\" must be, \"mar-shay-duh\" would sound quite a bit like \"mister,\" \"hol-lay\" could be twisted into \"honey\" with the change of one consonant, and the meaning, \"please,\" might conceivably advance Mulligan's wheedling entreaty. The fit is admittedly loose, but Molony's hypothesis is intriguing. Perhaps other Irish language models will eventually be proposed.\n The next two strange expressions appear to comically amplify the beggars' thirst. Slote cites P. W. Joyce's observation that in Hiberno-English, \"particularly in Ulster, 'Queer and' is an intensifier.\" Being \"queer and sick,\" then, means that Mulligan and Haines were sick unto dying with thirst. The OEDidentifies \"gallus\" as an obsolete form of \"gallows.\" The suggestion does not seem to be that the two men were longing for a pint that deserved capital punishment, or for a deadly one, or for one capable of promoting sexual excitement (Gifford, responding to the mention of rousing a friar who is \"limp with leching,\" wildly surmises that the word evokes \"the commonplace that a man being hanged has an erection in the process\"). Much better, though certainly strange enough, is Slote's observation that \"gallows\" too can be an intensifier. The OED lists, after all its other meanings, this one: \"With intensive force: Extremely, very, 'jolly'.\" A jolly big alcoholic potion, then.\n In the next paragraph, \"mavrone\" is a common Hiberno-English interjection borrowed from the Irish mo bhrón, meaning literally \"my sorrow\" or \"my regret.\" Mulligan's keening here takes the form of \"alas!\"—no drinks after all that time waiting. In \"drouthy clerics,\" he dips into obscure English once more. This is a Scottish variant of \"droughty,\" so the basic meaning is \"dry, without moisture, arid,\" but the OED lists a metaphorical application: \"thirsty; often = addicted to drinking.\" \n Finally, the \"pussful\" of ale that the good fathers and brothers do be wanting might possibly refer to their faces, but more likely it echoes a slang use of \"puss\" for \"mouth.\" These meanings cannot be found in most dictionaries of English written for English people, but The American Heritage Dictionary, which reflects many usages brought into American English by Irish immigrants, identifies both slang uses: \"1. The mouth. 2. The face. [Irish bus, lip, mouth, from Old Irish, lip].\" Dolan's Hiberno-English dictionary translates \"puss\" only as mouth, and \"shaping the lips so as to make a pout; sulking.\" It cites a response to such pouting: \"Take that ugly sour puss off your face and get on with the messages.\" Slote cites P. W. Joyce's relevant observation that \"puss\" is \"always used in dialect in an offensive or contemptuous sense.\" Churchmen can never catch a break from Mulligan."

  "010063ragging": {
    "note": " Currying favor with Stephen in Telemachus, Mulligan promises to take his side against the frighteningly aggressive Haines: \"If he makes any noise here I'll bring down Seymour and we'll give him a ragging worse than they gave Clive Kempthorpe.\" He seems to be recalling an incident of schoolboy hazing from his time at Oxford University (Oliver Gogarty spent a term there in early 1904), and Stephen responds with a revery about such an event happening at \"Magdalen\" (pronounced Maudlin), one of the Oxford colleges. The violence implicit in the scene softens his stance toward Haines.",
    "expandedNote": " Familiarity with Oxford is the basis of the friendship between Mulligan and Haines (\"the oxy chap downstairs\"), but the impoverished Stephen has never been there: rather, Mulligan’s words provoke a purely imaginary scene in his thoughts. If “Chrysostomos” introduced the novel's reliance on interior monologue, the two paragraphs starting with \"Young shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe's rooms\" announce a feature of interior monologue that Joyce will employ frequently: conjuring up a fanciful vignette. \n In the years when he was beginning to write fiction, Joyce described moments when events seem to be charged with symbolic significance as “epicleti” (a Greek Orthodox term for the moment of transubstantiation) or “epiphanies” (“a sudden spiritual transformation,” in the words of Stephen Hero). As Terence Brown observes in his introduction to the Penguin edition of Dubliners, such passages are not symbolic in the familiar sense of pointing beyond realistic events to “transcendent realities.” They are evanescent but very mundane moments in which psychological and social meaning lurk in the realistic details. In Ulysses as in A Portrait, Joyce both creates such fictive moments himself and shows Stephen composing them in his thoughts. Leopold Bloom often does the same thing.\n This particular epiphanic moment bespeaks uppercrust British educational privilege, with overtones of homosexuality and cruelty. To be “debagged” is to have one's pants pulled off, a schoolboy prank sometimes called \"pantsing\" or \"depantsing.\" Citing Eric Patridge's Dictionary of Slang, Slote identifies the word as an \"Oxford and (less commonly) Cambridge expression, from circa 1890, to remove the 'bags' or trousers of an objectionable student.\" The term apparently derived from \"Oxford bags,\" the baggy pants worn by Oxford undergraduates in Joyce's time. Stephen combines it with effete English talk (\"Oh, I shall expire! Break the news to her gently, Aubrey! I shall die!\") and with alarmingly concrete physical details (\"With slit ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the table, with trousers down at heels, chased by Ades of Magdalen with the tailor's shears\"). \n In much the same way that a schoolboy game of hockey makes Stephen think of the gruesome slaughters of war in Nestor, this harmless schoolboy hazing seems to evoke rape and castration in his imagination. With scissors being wielded around bared legs, \"bags\" could well refer to something other than trousers! In this connection, it is interesting that Stephen also adds to the scene his recurrent personal association with cattle. He is Bous Stephanoumenos, bullockbefriending bard, and his Greek given name evokes the garlanding of bulls before their sacrificial slaughter. By giving Clive Kempthorpe “A scared calf’s face gilded with marmalade” and having him call out, \"Don't you play the giddy ox with me!,” Stephen creates a sacrificial victim with a distinct resemblance to himself, just as he discerns kinship between himself and the pitifully weak Sargent in Nestor.\n Like Bloom, Stephen embodies the pacifism and physical cowardice that were such a notable part of Joyce’s constitution. Telemachus shows him responding to Mulligan's call for a hazing by conjuring up a fictive scene in which the aggressive action contains echoes of real violence; in doing so he identifies with the victim and recoils. Rather than welcome Mulligan's invitation to join forces against the alarming roommate, Stephen decides, after his little meditation is concluded, that violence cannot justify further violence: \"Let him stay . . . There's nothing wrong with him except at night.\" In Proteus he will do the same thing once again, conjuring up a scene of bloody retribution and recoiling from it."

    "note": " Stephen's inability to read \"the Greeks\" in \"the original\" mirrors the author's, and Joyce regretted this deficiency. But Mulligan's display of familiarity with the language seems more pretentious than impressive.",
    "expandedNote": " Epi oinopa ponton is probably the most familiar ancient Greek phrase on the planet, and Thalatta! Thalatta! likewise is something that a beginning student of Greek might take away from his Xenophon. Spraying around quotations like these hardly does Mulligan credit as a scholar. \n Joyce was a gifted linguist. The Jesuits taught him Latin, and he excelled in it. He taught himself Dano-Norwegian in order to read Ibsen’s plays in the original. He learned enough French to live in Paris, enough Italian to live in Trieste, and enough German to live in Zurich. Finnegans Wake contains echoes of nearly 70 languages. But the writer who modeled his first great masterpiece on the Odyssey never learned classical Greek. This ignorance abashed him. Richard Ellmann reproduces a June 1921 letter to Harriet Shaw Weaver in which Joyce observes, \n I don’t even know Greek though I am spoken of as erudite. My father wanted me to take Greek as third language, my mother German and my friends Irish. Result, I took Italian. I spoke or used to speak modern Greek not too badly (I speak four or five languages fluently enough) and have spent a great deal of time with Greeks of all kinds from noblemen down to onionsellers, chiefly the latter. I am superstitious about them. They bring me luck (512).\n He felt the same way about the Greek colors in which the first edition of Ulysses was bound: white letters on a carefully chosen sea-blue background. They brought him luck (524). \nDespite his lack of classical Greek, Joyce’s choice of Homer as the model on which to base his epic reflects a determination no less fervent than Mulligan’s to bring Ireland into the long European tradition of learning and art that began with the Greeks. Ellmann astutely observes that “Gogarty spoke of Hellenizing Ireland, Joyce (who knew no Greek) of Europeanizing it” (118). Ireland was a cultural backwater made stagnant by religious piety and colonial domination, and could not come into its own simply by turning inward. In the lecture titled \"Ireland, Island of Saints and Sages,\" Joyce lamented the present backwardness of his nation and expressed hope that it would \"resume its ancient position as the Hellas of the north some day.\""

  "060020redbank": {
    "note": " The \"Red Bank\" was a restaurant at 19-20 D'Olier Street, just south of the O'Connell Bridge over the Liffey. It was also a name for some famous oysters harvested in County Clare and sold at the restaurant when they were in season.",
    "expandedNote": " In 1845 a man named Burton Bindon opened the restaurant under his own name, but later he changed the name to Red Bank to capitalize on the reputation of the oysters grown on beds that he owned off the Clare coast (Mairtin Mac Con Iomaire, The Emergence, Development and Influence of French Haute Cuisine on Public Dining in Dublin Restaurants 1900-2000: An Oral History, 2009: 100). In 1904 the Red Bank was known as one of the finest restaurants in Dublin. The funeral cortège in Hades passes by it just before crossing the Liffey and traveling north along O'Connell Street. The occupants of Bloom's carriage see Blazes Boylan \"at the door of the Red Bank,\" probably emerging after lunch. Martin Cunningham, Jack Power, and Simon Dedalus all try to attract his attention. Bloom looks at his fingernails.\n Later, in Lestrygonians, Bloom processes some thoughts about the supposed aphrodisiac effects of eating oysters: \"Fizz and Red bank oysters. Effect on the sexual. Aphrodis. He was in the Red Bank this morning. Was he oysters old fish at table perhaps he young flesh in bed no June has no ar no oysters.\" The thought is apparently still on his mind in Circe when he \"eats twelve dozen oysters (shells included),\" demonstrating by this and sundry other miracles that he is indeed the Messiah. In the same chapter his grandfather Virag, author of the notable Fundamentals of Sexology, waxes rhapsodic on aphrodisiacs: \"Splendid! Spanish fly in his fly or mustard plaster on his dibble. . . . Redbank oysters will shortly be upon us. I'm the best o'cook. Those succulent bivalves may help us and the truffles of Perigord, tubers dislodged through mister omnivorous porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility or viragitis. Though they stink yet they sting.\"\n Molly does not know that Boylan has lunched in the Red Bank, but she too thinks about him eating oysters: \"he must have come 3 or 4 times with that tremendous big red brute of a thing he has I thought the vein or whatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is not so big after I took off all my things with the blinds down after my hours dressing and perfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a thick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters I think a few dozen he was in great singing voice no I never in all my life felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up.\"\n Thoughts about Red Bank oysters reach their lowest point in the book when the narrator of Cyclops describes the clot of phlegm that the Citizen ejects in response to Bloom saying that he considers himself an Irishman: \"The citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and, gob, he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner.\""

  "010042prayforme": {
    "note": " In Telemachus Mulligan says, \"The aunt thinks you killed your mother\" and he reproaches Stephen: \"You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother asked you.\" Here he resembles his model Oliver Gogarty, who casually declared to all his acquaintances “that Joyce was ‘mad,’ and ‘had killed his mother by telling her what he thought’” (Ellmann, 173). But Mulligan overstates the facts, assuming that they were similar to those surrounding Joyce’s mother’s death in August 1903, and Stephen's confrontation with his mother in Circe suggests that, rather than acting from cavalier disregard for her, he felt mortally threatened by the demand to kneel down before a God whom he had pledged in A Portrait of the Artist not to serve any longer. The filial guilt prompted by his dream of the dead woman is nothing compared to his terrified feeling that she has returned from the afterlife to reproach him for impiety and demand that he \"Repent!\"",
    "expandedNote": " Ellmann writes of Mary (\"May\") Joyce’s illness, “Her fear of death put her in mind of her son’s impiety, and on the days following Easter she tried to persuade him to make his confession and take communion. Joyce, however, was inflexible; he feared, as he had Stephen Dedalus say later, ‘the chemical action’ which would be set up in his soul ‘by a false homage to a symbol behind which are massed twenty centuries of authority and veneration.’ His mother wept, and vomited green bile into a basin, but he did not yield. His aunt Josephine Murray argued with him” (129, emphasis added). Four months later, in Mrs. Joyce’s final hours, “she lay in a coma, and the family knelt about her bed, praying and lamenting. Her brother John Murray, observing that neither Stanislaus nor James was kneeling, peremptorily ordered them to do so. Neither obeyed” (136). \n Joyce may have refused to compromise his spiritual integrity by making false declarations of faith, but he was not so priggishly self-righteous as to attempt to ruin other people's spiritual consolations. After his mother's death, he comforted his nine-year-old sister Mabel, sitting beside her on the stairs with “his arm around her, saying, ‘You must not cry like that because there is no reason to cry. Mother is in heaven. She is far happier now than she has ever been on earth, but if she sees you crying it will spoil her happiness. You must remember that when you feel like crying. You can pray for her if you wish, Mother would like that. But don’t cry any more’” (Ellmann, 136). The Stephen Dedalus of Telemachus was as sensitive to his mother's suffering as Joyce was to Mabel's: \"Silent with awe and pity I went to her bedside. She was crying in her wretched bed.\" \n Given such complex family dynamics, the accusation made by Gogarty and Mulligan seems callous and shallow. Joyce felt there was some, but only some, truth to the charge. At the end of August 1904 he wrote to Nora, “My mother was slowly killed, I think, by my father’s ill-treatment, by years of trouble, and by my cynical frankness of conduct. When I looked on her face as she lay in her coffin—a face grey and wasted with cancer—I understood that I was looking on the face of a victim and I cursed the system which had made her a victim” (Ellmann, 169). But he did not back down from his principled stand about kneeling in prayer. In the following paragraph of the same letter he wrote, “Six years ago I left the Catholic Church, hating it most fervently....I made secret war upon it when I was a student and declined to accept the positions it offered me....Now I make open war upon it by what I write and say and do.” \n Ulysses appears to heighten and focus the guilt Joyce felt, maximizing its narrative importance as much as the treatment of the black panther episode minimizes the narrative importance of those events. His anguish at the ghost's implicit demand that he kneel down in prayer attains a shattering climax in Circe, when it explicitly commands him to pray and repent: \"Prayer is allpowerful. Prayer for the suffering souls in the Ursuline manual and forty days' indulgence. Repent, Stephen....Repent! O, the fire of hell!\" The threat of fiery hell recalls the grand guignol horror of the Jesuit priest's sermons in part 3 of A Portrait, which terrifed Stephen into piety. By refusing to submit again to the almighty bludgeoning, he also, interestingly, plays the part of Don Giovanni, who refuses to \"Repent!\" even as the statue threatens him with eternal damnation."

  "030065gondoliers": {
    "note": " By calling Richie Goulding and his brother \"Highly respectable gondoliers,\" Simon Dedalus implies that they are beneath his social class. The phrase comes from a song in Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera The Gondoliers; or, The King of Barataria, which was first performed in 1889 at the Savoy Theatre in London. Since the opera satirizes class distinctions, Simon's allusion would seem to backfire on him.",
    "expandedNote": " The opera centers on two young Venetian gondoliers named Marco and Giuseppe Palmieri. They are very popular with the local girls, and, early in the opera, marry two of them. Meanwhile, a party of Spaniards arrives in Venice: the Duke and Duchess of Plaza-Toro, their daughter Casilda, and their drummer Luiz (they cannot afford the pretension of an entire band). They have come to meet the Grand Inquisitor of Spain, Don Alhambra. The duke and duchess tell their daughter that when she was only six months old she was married to the infant son of the King of Barataria. It turns out that the Grand Inquisitor kidnapped the young boy and took him to Venice, because the King had converted to Methodism. The King has recently been killed, and so Casilda has been brought to Venice to be united with her husband, who will assume the throne. Casilda is not happy about having been married without her permission or knowledge, and in fact she is in love with Luiz. \n The Grand Inquisitor arrives and reveals still more complications: when he brought the young prince to Venice, he left him with a \"highly respectable gondolier,\" to be raised alongside the boatman's own son. But the boatman was a drunk and lost track of which boy was which, and besides he is now dead. However, the prince's nurse (who turns out to be Luiz's mother) will be able to identify him, with the help of a little torture if necessary. She is living in the mountains around Cordoba, married to \"a highly respectable brigand.\" \n The Grand Inquisitor tells the Palmieri boys that one of them is a king and that they should both move to Spain until it can be determined which is which. He does not mention that the king is already married, and thus a bigamist. The boys agree to the plan. Both are republicans, and they announce that they will rule in an egalitarian way. The opening of act 2 finds them doing just that: they are doing all the work around the palace, and everyone else has been promoted into the nobility. The Grand Inquisitor arrives, and tells them that one of them has already been married to Casilda. Casilda too shows up with her parents, and tells the boys that she will be a good wife and queen to one of them, but she is in love with someone else. This proves cause for celebration to the boys and especially their wives.\n The opera concludes with the appearance of the old nurse, who says that in fact neither of the Palmieri boys is a prince. When the Grand Inquisitor instructed her to steal the infant, she gave him her own child instead, and raised the prince as her child. So Luiz is the king of Barataria, Casilda does not have to renounce him, and the Palmieri couples can return to their rightful home. The opera ends with a celebratory dance.\n It turns out, then, that neither of the young gondoliers is noble, and after they have returned to Venice the servants can return to doing the work in the Spanish court, and the nobility can return to doing nothing. Class distinctions are affirmed as they must be at the end of a comic subversion. But along the way, the opera has suggested that nothing substantial at all separates dukes from boatmen. Simon Dedalus appears to have rather missed the point.\n The lyrics to Don Alhambra's aria about a \"highly respectable gondolier\" are as follows:\n I stole the prince and I brought him here and I left him gaily prattling\n With a highly respectable gondolier, who promised the Royal babe to rear\n And teach him the trade of a timoneer with his own beloved bratling!\n Both of the babes were strong and stout, and, considering all things, clever\n Of that there is no manner of doubt, no probable, possible, shadow of doubt,\n No possible doubt whatever!\n Time sped, and when, at the end of the year, I sought that infant cherished,\n That highly respectable gondolier was lying a corpse on his humble bier—\n I dropped a Grand Inquisitor's tear; that gondolier had perished!\n A taste for drink, combined with gout, had doubled him up forever!\n Of that there is no manner of doubt, no probable, possible, shadow of doubt,\n No possible doubt whatever!\n But owing, I'm much disposed to fear, to his terrible taste for tippling,\n That highly respectable gondolier could never declare with a mind sincere\n Which of the two was his offspring dear, and which the royal stripling.\n Which was which he could never make out, despite his best endeavour\n Of that there is no manner of doubt, no probable, possible, shadow of doubt,\n No possible doubt whatever!\n The children followed his old career—this statement can't be parried—\n Of a highly respectable gondolier; Well, one of the two (who will soon be here)\n But which of the two it is not quite clear—is the royal prince you married!\n Search in and out and round about and you'll discover never\n A tale so free from every doubt, all probable, possible, shadow of doubt,\n All possible doubt whatever!"

  "060030retrospective": {
    "note": " The men in Bloom's carriage in Hades mock their friend Tom Kernan for using pretentious words like \"trenchant.\" But the other expression that invites their ridicule, \"retrospective arrangement,\" recurs half a dozen times more in the novel, only two of them connected to Kernan, and thus acquires significance beyond anything that he might intend. Mnemonic ordering operates in activities as diverse as history and music, and it is essential to the formation of personal and national identity. It is also a central principle of Joyce's artistic representation of human lives.",
    "expandedNote": " In Wandering Rocks, Kernan uses the phrase as he thinks about the \"Times of the troubles,\" i.e. the Rebellion of 1798: \"When you look back on it all now in a kind of retrospective arrangement.\" There is no telling what particular insights he may have in mind, but this fragmentary sentence suggests that events acquire significance later, as people organize them in memory. In the blur of present action, with no clear beginnings and endings, no one can grasp the shape of a life or an era. With the benefit of hindsight, however, people construct narratives that give explanatory structure to otherwise random dates, events, actions, and developments. Historians find the kinds of things they are looking for, and they order them in ways that make sense retrospectively. Even when they aspire to objectivity they can never fully achieve it, because their stories are informed by political, experiential, temperamental, and intellectual investments. \n The narrative of Sirens shows Kernan reminiscing once more as a song drives the listeners in the hotel bar deep into their own thoughts: \"While Goulding talked of Barraclough’s voice production, while Tom Kernan, harking back in a retrospective sort of arrangement talked to listening Father Cowley, who played a voluntary, who nodded as he played. While big Ben Dollard talked with Simon Dedalus, lighting, who nodded as he smoked, who smoked.\" Again, there is no way to know which particular recollections Kernan may be engaged in, but the songs in this chapter frequently move people to think back on past events: memorable performances of songs, personal experiences, the course of Irish history. Music's ability to stir emotion, and the deep sense of meaning that most human beings find in it, seem to be intimately connected to its exercise of the powers of memory.\n In Oxen of the Sun the phrase jumps to a new character whose thoughts are more available to the reader: \"No longer is Leopold, as he sits there, ruminating, chewing the cud of reminiscence, that staid agent of publicity and holder of a modest substance in the funds. A score of years are blown away. He is young Leopold. There, as in a retrospective arrangement, a mirror within a mirror (hey, presto!), he beholdeth himself.\" In this paragraph Bloom becomes engrossed in remembering himself as a teenager—going off to school in the morning, taking up his father's trade of traveling salesman, visiting a prostitute for the first time. The narrative poignantly emphasizes the chasm between that youthful man and the present one, suggesting that recollection does not really recover the past. It is only a facsimile of something lost, \"a mirror within a mirror\" in which the present observer \"beholdeth himself.\"\n The narrative of Eumaeus drives that impression home when Bloom reminisces about Parnell: \"Looking back now in a retrospective kind of arrangement all seemed a kind of dream. And then coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it went without saying you would feel out of place as things always moved with the times.\" Even if his coffin were full of stones and Parnell could return, he would not come back to the historical moment that he dominated. Analogously, none of us can return to those moments that memory gives us the illusion of revisiting. The moments were evanescent as a dream, and all we can do is curate the memories—cherishing, repressing, preserving, interrogating, interpreting, combining, and frequently altering.\n Just as nations and peoples constitute their identity though stories of how they came to be and to endure, individuals and families construct personal identities by selectively re-membering where they came from. Ithaca reports that Bloom's traveling salesman father did this in the most literal way possible, instilling a geographical sense of the family's origins in his young son. He \"narrated to his son Leopold Bloom (aged 6) a retrospective arrangement of migrations and settlements in and between Dublin, London, Florence, Milan, Vienna, Budapest, Szombathely with statements of satisfaction (his grandfather having seen Maria Theresia, empress of Austria, queen of Hungary), with commercial advice (having taken care of pence, the pounds having taken care of themselves). Leopold Bloom (aged 6) had accompanied these narrations by constant consultation of a geographical map of Europe (political) and by suggestions for the establishment of affiliated business premises in the various centres mentioned.\" \n The main characters of Ulysses all demonstrate the principle that Stephen articulates in Scylla and Charybdis: that I \"am I by memory because under everchanging forms.\" They are known partly by their responses to present stimuli, but more by their abundant, though scattered, memories of the past. In this way they resemble their creator, who wrote prose fictions that have much in common with creative autobiography. \"I have a grocer's assistant's mind,\" Joyce once said (Ellmann, Letters III, 304). Instead of inventing stories, he arranged them, selecting details from the universe of things that had happened to him, looking at them from different angles, altering them when he saw fit, fitting them into new structures. He reconstituted his existence by creatively re-ordering it in memory, a faculty which, Blake's disparagement notwithstanding, gave him a path to freedom and radiant clarity.\n \"Retrospective arrangement\" is also a supremely apt name for what readers of Ulysses must do. Anyone who manages a first trip through this book deserves an award, so baffling are its thousands of obscure allusions, ideational fragments, and stylistic quirks. While much of the linear story (the one that chronologically follows the course of one day) can be grasped in an initial experience of the book, other kinds of patterning can only be appreciated on subsequent readings, because the non-linear connections insinuated on every page (say, by introducing an obscure detail whose significance will become clearer four hundred pages later) constitute structures that must be held in memory. To adapt what Stephen says aboutGotthold Lessing, Ulysses must be read both nacheinander (temporally, one paragraph after another) and nebeneinander (quasi-spatially, arranging related passages beside one another). Notes like this one cultivate the second, retrospective way of reading Joyce's novel."

    "note": " In fact only one of the two men is \"returning\" to the source from which he began his day's journeying. (Stephen has no home, and halfway through Ithaca it becomes clear that he has miles to go before he sleeps.) But by analogy with Homer's Odyssey this chapter does represent a return, not only because Bloom goes home at the end of a long day, but also because he sets his mental house in order. With its crystalline if quirky rationality, the chapter's prose imitates this process of coming to intellectual rest.",
    "expandedNote": " Odysseus' story is a nostos or homecoming—a \"return.\" At the end of the epic he has rejoined his son, wife, and father, regained his ancestral palace, and exterminated the suitors who usurped his place. Bloom lacks nothing but a latchkey to regain entrance to his marital bed, and modern societies frown on shedding adulterers' blood. His task is to regain some of the mental balance that has been threatened by anxiety over his wife's unfaithfulness, an assault by a murderous anti-Semite, snubs by countless Dubliners, grieving thoughts about his dead father and son, worries about aging and loss of happiness, and a prolonged encounter with his own fears, unfulfilled wishes, and sexual pathologies. The intellectual conversation that he has with Stephen Dedalus on the way to his house, inside its kitchen, and in the yard behind—a more creditable analogue of the reunion of Odysseus and Telemachus than occurred in Eumaeus—sets him on a path to mental equilibrium. \n In A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man Stephen praised art that is static rather than kinetic: \"The feelings excited by improper art are kinetic, desire or loathing. Desire urges us to possess, to go to something; loathing urges us to abandon, to go from something. These are kinetic emotions. The arts which excite them, pornographical or didactic, are therefore improper arts. The esthetic emotion (I use the general term) is therefore static. The mind is arrested and raised above desire and loathing.\" Ithaca shows Bloom working to raise his mind above desire and loathing, and its own relentless catechetical succession of questions and answers arrests the mind of the reader in a kind of Olympian detachment. \n For Bloom, this stasis takes the form of calming the troubled waters of his mind, viewing his situation as rationally and optimistically as he can, deciding (for the time being, at least) to return to the bed of his matrimonial violation, and slipping peacefully into sleep. For Stephen's equally troubled mind the chapter offers no comparable return to tranquility. But the book has shown him repeatedly envisioning such a recapitulation, especially in his account of Shakespeare returning to Stratford in Scylla and Charybdis."

Richie Goulding works as a \"costdrawer\" or cost accountant (a position that involves scrutinizing the costs of a business to improve its management) in a firm of Dublin solicitors called \"Collis and Ward.\" In Proteus Stephen thinks of him doing his paperwork at home in the morning. Wandering Rocks shows Goulding moving about town with his \"costbag\" of work papers. In Sirens he joins Bloom for an early supper in the Ormond hotel dining room.",
    "expandedNote": " Josephine Murray was Joyce's favorite aunt, and the fact that Stephen thinks of his aunt as the reason for visiting Strasburg Terrace—\"Am I going to aunt Sara's or not?\"—suggests that he may hold a similar affection. Richie Goulding is another matter. In addition to his domineering manner with his children and wife, the novel glances several times at his alcoholism. Simon Dedalus' penchant for calling him \"the drunken little costdrawer\" may be hypocritical, but Bloom's thoughts about how Richie used to be the life of the party and now is \"Paying the piper\" support the inference that he is a chronic abuser. Richie also suffers from the more comical vice of pretension. In Hades Bloom thinks of how he likes to add his own name to the legal firm's moniker: \"Goulding, Collis and Ward he calls the firm.\" This is surely a fabrication, as Goulding is not an attorney and lives in a shabby part of town. \n One other detail might be taken as implying criticism: Stephen's \"nuncle Richie.\"As Thornton notes, this obsolete form of \"uncle\" appears many times in King Lear and nowhere else in Shakespeare. Thornton does not draw any inferences from the possible allusion, but all seventeen appearances of the word are addresses of the Fool to King Lear. Given the relationship of these two characters—an irreverent comedian speaking unflattering truths to a violently egomaniacal old man—it is reasonable to suppose that Stephen's unspoken form of address (when he speaks he calls him \"uncle Richie\") may carry a sting in its tail. \n Yet one more possible joke about Richie Goulding lurks in the book's textures. In Lestrygonians Bloom wonders if this well-known practical joker may have been responsible for the postcard sent to Denis Breen: \"U.P.: up. I'll take my oath that's Alf Bergan or Richie Goulding. Wrote it for a lark in the Scotch house I bet anything.\" If Bloom is right, then it is hugely ironic that, as Breen stomps around town looking for legal help in taking out an action of libel against the perpetrators, he settles on the very solicitors who employ Goulding: \"Denis Breen with his tomes, weary of having waited an hour in John Henry Menton's office, led his wife over O'Connell bridge, bound for the office of Messrs Collis and Ward.\"\n Joyce did not alter his uncle's employment much in turning him into Richie Goulding. M. C. Rintoul's Dictionary of Real People and Places in Fiction (Routledge, 1993) notes that William Murray \"was employed as a billing clerk in a well-known firm of Dublin solicitors\" (696). Vivien Igoe confirms this, noting that Murray \"worked as a cost accountant at the law agency of James J. Giltrap, at 2 Morgan Place, near the Four Courts. In 1899 on the death of Mr Giltrap, his father-in-law, he moved to a firm of solicitors, Collis & Ward, at 23 Dame Street.\" Igoe observes also that, \"Like Richie, Murray was fond of music and opera.\" Joyce reflects this passion in Proteus by having Richie \"drone\" and \"whistle\" strains of Verdi's Il Trovatore, all the while praising the aria to Stephen."

    "note": " The Richmond Lunatic Asylum, a psychiatric facility in the northwest Dublin suburb of Grangegorman that at the time was the largest and most important in Ireland, is mentioned several times in the novel. In Telemachus Mulligan refers to it mockingly as \"Dottyville\" and mentions \"Conolly Norman,\" who superintended the Asylum from 1886 until his death in 1908. In Circe Bello notes that \"Keating Clay is elected vicechairman of the Richmond asylum,\" and in Oxen of the Sun one of the medical students speculates that the man in the macintosh has been released from there.",
    "expandedNote": " Mulligan mentions the asylum in connection with his taunting suggestion that Stephen has \"g.p.i.,\" general paresis of the insane. Joyce's fictional interest in insanity parallels Ireland's therapeutic interest in it; the country has a long history of building hospitals for the care of the mentally ill. Later in the 20th century the Richmond Lunatic Asylum became known more respectfully as the Grangegorman Mental Hospital, one part of a complex of buildings called St. Brendan's Psychiatric Hospital. The hospital complex has been progressively decommissioned in the last two decades, however, and much of it either lies in ruins or has been demolished."

    "expandedNote": " Quoting from English Riddles from Oral Tradition, Thornton quotes the lines that follow: \"The seed was black and the ground was white. / Riddle me that and I'll give you a pipe (or a pint).\" He observes that \"Stephen simply suppresses the final lines of this riddle, as he suppresses parts of other things he alludes to.

    "note": " At the beginning of Calypso, an odd verbal mannerism characterizes Bloom's concern for getting his wife's breakfast plate exactly right: \"Another slice of bread and butter : three, four : right. She didn't like her plate full. Right.\" At the beginning of Hades, in all printed texts before Gabler's 1984 edition, a similar, and rhyming, repetition presents his need to make sure that the carriage door has latched tight: \"He pulled the door to after him and slammed it tight till it shut tight.\" (Gabler's text substitutes \"twice\" for the first \"tight.) The need to close the door either twice or tight tight suggests insecurity on Bloom's part. A psychologist might speculate that he suffers from a touch of obsessive-compulsive disorder.",
    "expandedNote": " OCD is not a new diagnosis. The British term \"obsession\" and the American term \"compulsion\" both started as translations of the German word Zwangsvorstellung (\"forced ideas,\" i.e. compulsive ideation), coined in 1877 by neurologist and psychiatrist Carl Westphal. (Westphal also invented the term agoraphobia, and made several other important medical discoveries, including the first clinical descriptions of narcolepsy and cataplexy. According to Michel Foucault, he originated the modern idea of the homosexual.)\n A decade earlier, in 1868, the neurologist and psychiatrist Wilhelm Griesinger published three case studies of a neurosis that he called Grübelsucht (meaning something like \"brooding-searching\" disorder). Many French, German, and Austrian psychologists of the 19th and early 20th centuries sought fitting language to investigate the nature and causes of obsessive thoughts and actions. Identification of the problem began still earlier. A web article posted by the Stanford University School of Medicine cites instances from the 17th century, including one from Ireland: \"In 1660, Jeremy Taylor, Bishop of Down and Connor, Ireland, was referring to obsessional doubting when he wrote of 'scruples': '[A scruple] is trouble where the trouble is over, a doubt when doubts are resolved'\" (see http://ocd.stanford.edu/treatment/history.html). \n In 1888 the Irish expert on mental disorders whom Buck Mulligan mentions in Telemachus gave a talk titled \"A Rare Form of Mental Disease (Grübelsucht),\" which was later published under his name and occupation: \"Conolly Norman, M.K.Q.C.P., F.R.C.S.; Medical Superintendent of the Richmond District Asylum, Dublin.\" Norman refers to Griesinger's 1868 publication and notes that the illness \"has no recognised designation in English.\" He translates the old verb grübeln as \"to go about inquiring, to inquire closely, to busy oneself inquiring about subtle questions or trivial matters, to pry,\" and says that the essential feature of the disease is \"the obsession of the mind by an imperative mode of thought, taking the form of perpetual interrogation, a constant urgent morbid impulse to inquire into and investigate everything, an incapacity to accept contentedly the ordinary postulates of knowledge.\" Many of these questions, he notes, are \"of an entirely unpractical and untheoretical nature; but this is not necessarily so.\" He cites the case of a woman who, when she woke up, experienced dread of what would happen if she did not get out of bed immediately. She felt \"compelled to examine any bit of straw or paper or glass that she saw. In the street she must find out what any scrap of written or printed paper was and to what it referred.\" A taste of soup sent her into loops of questioning whether or not thyme was one of the ingredients, and whether some of her sips were in fact detecting thyme or some other spice, and what thyme really is, and so on. \n Diagnosing mental diseases in literary characters and dead authors is an intellectually suspect, and frequently frivolous, enterprise. But Joyce was interested in late 19th century psychological theories. In Circe he applied some of the theories of the \"sexologists\" (Richard von Krafft-Ebing, Havelock Ellis, Sigmund Freud) to the understanding of Bloom's neuroses, no doubt performing some psychoanalysis on himself as he wrote. It may be worth asking whether the author connected Bloom's incessant questioning with a morbid tendency to overthink the smallest details of daily life.\n § For the sentence in Hades, the Rosenbach manuscript of Ulysses reads \"slammed it twice till it shut tight,\" but other handwritten manuscripts read \"slammed it tight till it shut tight.\" Gabler assumed that the first \"tight\" was a typesetter's error, caused by anticipating the appearance of that word three words later, so he overruled previous editors. But the repetition makes psychological sense for Bloom, who (in addition to any obsessive-compulsive tendencies he may have) feels socially insecure in the presence of Cunningham, Power, and Dedalus. And the sentence is more aesthetically arresting and interesting that way. Consequently, my online text reads \"tight,\" following my preferred practice of respecting earlier textual history when in doubt."

  "030099ringsend": {
    "note": " \"Ringsend\" is the part of town just east of Dublin on the south bank of the Liffey. It is separated from the city by the mouth of the River Dodder, which once was a broad estuary. By Joyce's time the river had been confined by a walled channel, but Ringsend retained the quality of a separate town on the seacoast. Walking southeast of it on the tide flats in Proteus, Stephen observes some of its present maritime features, and apparently also imagines some others in the distant past.",
    "expandedNote": " \"Broken hoops on the shore; at the land a maze of dark cunning nets; farther away chalkscrawled backdoors and on the higher beach a dryingline with two crucified shirts\": these are all details that seem to inhere in the present. But those that come after may be fantasies of what Ringsend looked like in the past: \"wigwams of brown steersmen and master mariners.\" Gifford infers from the fact that wigwams are temporary dwellings (round-roofed pole structures used by northeastern Native American and Canadian First Nation tribes, somewhat similar to the Plains Indians' pointed tipis) that Stephen must be thinking of a time when the area was lightly inhabited by seamen who had only one foot on the shore. \n Before the construction of the Great South Wall, Ringsend was the last spit of land before the ocean, and hence a destination for ships coming to Dublin. In the 19th century shipping moved into the heart of the city, lessening the village's maritime character. In the years since 1904 the attenuation has continued. The next suburb down the coast, Irishtown, has been extended considerably eastward on reclaimed land, meaning that Ringsend is now landlocked, and it has become just one more working-class suburb.\n Ringsend is also mentioned in Hades, Aeolus, Eumaeus, andIthaca. And although it is not mentioned in this capacity in the novel, it was the place where James and Nora went out walking on their first date."

He is robbed in Dublin, housed with pigs during the sea crossing to Holyhead, and taunted to fight in Liverpool. With the help of some boys from Galway, though, he gets his own back from the Liverpudlians.",
    "expandedNote": " In pointed response, then, to Deasy's (false) story of a Protestant nobleman putting on his \"shiny topboots\" to ride merrily down to Dublin from the north and affirm Ireland's glorious Union with Great Britain, Stephen recalls a popular account of a poor Catholic peasant trudging over rocky roads to Dublin from the west, looking for honest work and encountering disrespect, hatred, and abuse. Like Croppies Lie Down some ten lines earlier, the recollection of this line shows Stephen using music to silently resist his oppressor.\n The Rocky Road to Dublin is a great song, and the Dubliners have owned it since the 60s. Their masterful rendition of the fast 9/8 slip jig (almost rap-like in its constant verbal repetitions and echoes) can use some accompanying lyrics. Here is your annotator's best effort at transcribing a recent performance, with some language from earlier recordings when I cannot make out the words:\n 'Twas in the merry month of June when from me home I started,\n Left the girls of Tuam, sadly broken hearted,\n Saluted father dear, kissed me darling mother,\n Drank a pint of beer, me tears and grief to smother,\n Then off to reap the corn, and leave where I was born,\n I cut a stout black thorn to banish ghosts and goblins;\n A brand new pair of brogues to rattle o'er the bogs\n And frighten all the dogs on the rocky road to Dublin.\n (Chorus)\n One, two, three four, five,\n Hunt the hare and turn her \n Down the rocky road\n And all the way to Dublin,\n Whack follol de dah!\n In Mullingar that night I rested limbs so weary,\n Started by daylight next morning bright and early,\n Took a drop of the pure to keep me spirit from sinking;\n That's the Paddy's cure, whenever he's up for drinking.\n To see the lassies smile, laughing all the while\n At me curious style, 'twould set your heart a bubblin'\n They asked if I was hired, wages I required,\n Till I was almost tired of the rocky road to Dublin.\n (Chorus)\n In Dublin next arrived, I thought it was a pity\n To be so soon deprived a view of that fine city.\n Was then I took a stroll, all among the quality;\n Me bundle it was stole, all in a neat locality.\n Something crossed me mind, when I looked behind,\n No bundle could I find upon me stick a wobblin'.\n Enquiring after the rogue, they said me Connaught brogue\n It wasn't much in vogue on the rocky road to Dublin.\n (Chorus)\n From there I got away, me spirits never falling,\n Landed on the quay, just as the ship was sailing.\n The Captain at me roared, said that no room had he;\n When I jumped aboard, a cabin found for Paddy.\n Down among the pigs, played some lonely rigs,\n And danced some hearty jigs, the water round me bubbling;\n When off Holyhead I wished meself was dead,\n Or better for instead on the rocky road to Dublin.\n (Chorus)\n The boys of Liverpool, when we safely landed,\n Called meself a fool, I could no longer stand it.\n Blood began to boil, temper I was losing;\n Poor old Erin's Isle they began abusing.\n \"Hurrah me soul\" says I, me Shillelagh I let fly.\n Some Galway boys were by and saw I was a hobblin',\n With a loud \"hurray!\" they joined me in the affray.\n We quickly cleared the way for the rocky road to Dublin.\n (Chorus)"

    "note": " \"By lorries along sir John Rogerson's quay\": at the beginning of Lotus Eaters Bloom stands more than a mile southeast of his home, in the docklands near the mouth of the Liffey. As the chapter progresses he will move south from this starting point, away from the river, in an inland action that recalls the corresponding episode in the Odyssey.",
    "expandedNote": " A quay (pronounced KEY) is a wharf where oceangoing ships can be loaded and unloaded. In Dublin the term applies (with different proper names every few blocks) to all the central-city streets running along the river's banks, even though bridge construction through the centuries has pushed maritime access farther and farther east. (Today, the docklands have been moved off the Liffey entirely.) Gifford glosses \"lorries\" as the \"waterside cranes\" used to transfer goods to and from the moored ships. Gunn and Hart say that they are flat wagons (35).\n Sir John Rogerson's Quay is named for a former Lord Mayor of Dublin who in 1713 was allowed to develop 133 acres near Ringsend on the eastern edge of the river's south bank, on the condition that he construct a quay. The wharf was operational by the middle of the 18th century, and over the course of the 19th century many storehouses and other businesses were built along it.\n § The echo is fleeting, but Joyce must have known that by beginning his chapter on the docks he was evoking the setting of Homer's story of the lotos eaters. In Book 9 of the Odyssey, Odysseus recounts how his ships anchored along an unknown coastline and he sent out a scouting party to learn who lived farther inland. As in other such adventures (especially those involving the Lestrygonians and the Cyclopes), what the mariners found there posed a mortal threat to their hopes of returning home to Ithaca. As Bloom turns right onto Lime Street and ventures inland, then, he is symbolically moving into dangerous territory."

  "060031ferry": {
    "note": " As the funeral carriages pass over the Royal Canal, Bloom watches a boatman standing on his barge as it drops down into the draining lock. Since Hades is studded with references to the underworlds of classical epics, this detail tempts one to hear an echo of Charon, the boatman who ferries souls across the river Styx in Virgil's Aeneid and the river Acheron in Dante's Inferno. The inference is justified several sentences later as Bloom combines his memory of a local boatman who recently died with his memory of a poem about a boatman's deadly water crossing: \"James M'Cann's hobby to row me o'er the ferry.\"",
    "expandedNote": " Gifford notes that James M'Cann \"was chairman of the court of directors of the Grand Canal Company, which maintained a regular fleet of trade boats on the Grand Canal (to central and southern Ireland).\" Since Bloom is crossing the Royal Canal, on the north side of Dublin, the geography would seem to be wrong. But M'Cann, Gifford goes on to observe, died on 12 February 1904. He thus \"has already arrived in Hades\" and could very well play the part of Charon, helping Bloom cross the northern river that separates Dublin from the land of the dead in Glasnevin. In life such tasks constituted a paying profession for McCann. Now it seems they are a \"hobby.\" \n In a note on JJON, Terence Killeen observes that use of the word \"ferry\" to refer not to a boat or its action of crossing a stream, but to the \"place where boats pass over a river etc. to transport passengers and goods\" (in the same way that a \"ford\" can be a place as well as an action) is \"all but obsolete now and was probably obscure in 1904.\" But Bloom, he suggests, is thinking of a line from a poem written a century earlier:\n A chieftain to the Highlands bound\n Cries, \"Boatman, do not tarry!\n And I'll give thee a silver pound\n To row us o'er the ferry.\"\n Lord Ullin's Daughter, published in 1804, was written by a Scottish poet whose work Bloom seems to know—later in Hades he tries to recall who wrote Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard and comes up with \"Wordsworth or Thomas Campbell.\" Campbell's ballad describes the plight of Lord Ullin's daughter and the young chieftain she has run off with as they flee her father's soldiers. The ferryman agrees to save the bridegroom from the sword, but the \"dark and stormy water\" threatens no less mortal peril. Lord Ullin arrives at the shore of the loch in time to watch his girl drown: \"The waters wild went o'er his child, / And he was left lamenting.\"\n Lord Ullin's Daughter, then, coheres with the possible echo of Charon in its depiction of a boat ferrying people over some very dark waters. By changing \"row us\" to \"row me,\" Bloom puts himself in the boat, confirming the impression that he is being ferried to the land of the dead. It seems odd that his meditation on McCann and Campbell comes in the middle of about a dozen sentences in which he thinks about traveling west along the canal to see Milly in Mullingar. But these sentences are preceded and followed, at the beginning and end of the paragraph, by long gazes at the boatman, so Bloom has him in view the whole time. Death breaks in on his happy dreaming."

  "030118royaldublins": {
    "note": " The \"Royal Dublin Fusiliers,\" or \"Royal Dublins,\" were an Irish infantry regiment of the British army from 1881 until the founding of the Irish Free State in 1922. Molly Bloom's father, identified in Oxen of the Sun as \"a gallant major\" and inIthaca as \"Major Brian Cooper Tweedy, Royal Dublin Fusiliers\" (though he may have been only a sergeant-major), served in this regiment in the 2nd Battalion stationed in Gibraltar. After his time, the regiment sent both of its regular battalions to South Africa to fight in the Second Boer War from 1899 to 1902.",
    "expandedNote": " In Proteus, Stephen imagines a gypsy woman's companion selling her body to \"two Royal Dublins\" in Blackpitts, and this association with prostitution continues in Lotus Eaters when Bloom scans the troops in a recruiting poster looking for the regiment that Molly's father served in: \"Where's old Tweedy's regiment? Castoff soldier. There: bearskin cap and hackle plume. No, he's a grenadier. Pointed cuffs. There he is: royal Dublin fusiliers. Redcoats. Too showy. That must be why the women go after them. Uniform. Easier to enlist and drill. Maud Gonne's letter about taking them off O'Connell street at night: disgrace to our Irish capital. Griffith's paper is on the same tack now: an army rotten with venereal disease.\"\n When he is accosted by two policemen in Circe, however, Bloom leaps to associate himself with the troops, because of his involvement in a pro-Boer demonstration in 1899: \"My wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant upstanding gentleman, what do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy, one of Britain's fighting men who helped to win our battles. Got his majority for the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift.\" Now the major, perhaps already glorified from a mere sergeant-major, has become a general officer. Gifford suggests that Bloom is thinking of another man of the same name, Major General Willis Tweedie, who commanded troops in India. The assertion that Tweedy fought in the battle of Rorke's Drift against the Zulus in 1879 may also be fantastic: nothing else in the novel confirms it. \n Challenged by a constable to name his \"Regiment,\" Bloom \"Turns to the gallery\" and affirms his connection with Tweedy's outfit: \"The royal Dublins, boys, the salt of the earth, known the world over. I think I see some old comrades in arms up there among you. The R. D. F., with our own Metropolitan police, guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body of men, as physique, in the service of our sovereign.\" Someone accuses Bloom of being a \"Turncoat\" who supported the Boers against the British cause, and he asserts that he fought in the Second Boer War \"and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was mentioned in dispatches.\"\n Later in the episode, when Stephen finds himself in trouble with two soldiers, Bloom tells them that \"We fought for you in South Africa, Irish missile troops. Isn't that history? Royal Dublin Fusiliers. Honoured by our monarch.\" The air of fantastical elaboration still clings in the phrase \"missile troops.\" Fusil is French for a long gun, and the first fusiliers in the late 17th century carried flintlock muskets. In the 19th and early 20th centuries they were riflemen, not manners of missile batteries."

  "040021ruby": {
    "note": " The pulp fiction in which Molly encounters the word metempsychosis, \"Ruby: the Pride of the Ring,\" is based on an actual book published fifteen years earlier by Amye Reade, Ruby. A Novel. Founded on the Life of a Circus Girl (London, 1889). Though sentimental and melodramatic, Reade's novel is driven by a serious purpose: indicting the vicious exploitation of human beings in 19th century circus troupes. Bloom shares her compassionate horror at these sufferings, but Joyce also makes the story raise questions about male sexual domination, as well as thoughts of loss and renewal. Ruby returns again and again in Circe.",
    "expandedNote": " Thumbing through Molly's book in Calypso, Bloom comes across an interesting plate: \"Fierce Italian with carriagewhip. Must be Ruby pride of the on the floor naked.\" Beneath the picture he reads the sentence which it illustrates: \"The monster Maffei desisted and flung his victim from him with an oath.\" Joyce added the name Maffei to the caption. He slightly changed the title of the book, and made Bloom mistake the identity of the naked woman on the floor. But these small changes do not detract from the central message of Reade's novel. Bloom shares her revulsion at inflicting suffering on human beings (and animals) to promote the thrills of public entertainment: \"Cruelty behind it all. Doped animals. Trapeze at Hengler's. Had to look the other way. Mob gaping. Break your neck and we'll break our sides.\"\n Reade's novel tells the story of how Ruby Hayward, the daughter of an ideal father and a horrible mother, is sold into slavery at the tender age of thirteen to Signor Enrico, a circus master. Enrico treats his indentured servant as he would an animal, driving her to exhaustion and beating her when she does not meet his expectations. Utterly worn out, she falls from a horse just when her father Jack has conveniently returned from Australia and decided to attend the circus, not knowing that his daughter is employed there. He and Ruby's fellow rider and friend, Victoria Melton, attend Ruby on her deathbed, and Reade ends the novel happily by marrying Vic to Jack and giving the couple a daughter whom they name Ruby. Passing up the opportunity to associate the evil Enrico with Henry Flower, Joyce changed his name to Maffei, which Gifford speculates may suggest mafiosi.\n Enrico strips his girls naked before beating them, but, incredibly, the novel never suggests that he is sexually abusing them. The illustration by Talbot Hughes manages to make the suggestion, although he covers the naked Vic with a sheet for decency's sake. This titillating detail catches Bloom's attention: \"Hello. Illustration.\" So, in addition to giving Joyce a vehicle (one of many) for presenting Bloom's compassionate responses to the sufferings of other sentient creatures, the novel also ties into the masochistic aspect of Bloom's sexuality.\n The sadomasochistic implications of Ruby are developed in Circe, where, by the kind of associative logic that Sigmund Freud saw operating in dreams, the circus ring where Ruby performs becomes a wedding ring signifying domination. When Bloom compensates for Molly's betrayal by playing the Don Juan with Josie Breen (what Stephen calls \"assumed diongiovannism\" in Scylla and Charybdis), he marks his conquest with a ring: \"(Tenderly, as he slips on her finger a ruby ring.) Là ci darem la mano.\" Later, when he is crowned king of Ireland, the ring adorns Bloom's hand, to signify his power: \"Bloom assumes a mantle of cloth of gold and puts on a ruby ring. He ascends and stands on the stone of destiny.\" \n But the ring is most at home representing Bloom's submissive tendencies. When Bella Cohen becomes Bello and Bloom becomes one of her girls, she names him Ruby: \"What you longed for has come to pass. Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a thing under the yoke. Now for your punishment frock. You will shed your male garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen? and don the shot silk luxuriously rustling over head and shoulders. And quickly too!\" Bloom's transformation into a woman, which figuratively expresses his tendency to abase himself before beautiful women, is sealed when Bello places a ring on his finger: \"By day you will souse and bat our smelling underclothes also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines with dress pinned up and a dishclout tied to your tail. Won't that be nice? (He places a ruby ring on her finger.) And there now! With this ring I thee own. Say, thank you, mistress.\" \n Ruby's story implicitly addresses not only men's domination of women, but also the conventions of clothing by which women are made sexually alluring to men and defined as subordinate beings. Ruby resists the revealing toy-doll costume which she is expected to wear in the circus, to no avail. Bello subjects Bloom to the same objectifying conventions: \"As they are now so will you be, wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven armpits. Tape measurements will be taken next your skin. You will be laced with cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille with whalebone busk to the diamondtrimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks, pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course, with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie.\" \n In developing these implications of the Ruby story, Joyce may have been influenced by The Subjection of Women (1869), the book that John Stuart Mill wrote with his wife Harriet Taylor Mill. The Mills likened marriage laws to slavery, and argued that \"woman\" is to a very large degree a social construction. \n The source of Joyce's Ruby was discovered by Mary Power, who published an article titled \"The Discovery of Ruby\" in James Joyce Quarterly 18.2 (1981), pp. 115-21. Among other comments, Power observes that, although the word \"metempsychosis\" does not appear in Reade's novel, it does seem appropriate to what she is doing. Amye Reade \"anticipates Joyce's interest in changes of state,\" and she reincarnates Ruby as Jack's new daughter, showing that \"future generations can overcome past tragedies\" (121). \n It seems quite likely that Joyce acknowledged this transmigration of souls with one final, faintly audible allusion in Circe. When Bloom has a vision of his dead son at the end of the chapter, a vision prompted by gazing on Stephen with paternal interest, the association between Rudy and ruddy coloration adds touches of deep red to the boy's figure: \"He has a delicate mauve face. On his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons.\" Rudy is Bloom's Ruby, and like Jack Hayward he has a chance to renew him in the present."

(\"Ruddy\" often substitutes as a euphemism for \"bloody\" in British slang. The American Heritage dictionary records the curse \"You ruddy liar!\" in John Galsworthy's Forsyte saga, and the stage directions for Keith Waterhouse's play Billy Liar note that if the character Geoffrey Fisher is not allowed to say \"bloody\" all the time, his favorite curse word should be omitted in performance rather than altered to some harmless equivalent like \"ruddy.\") \n The most striking thing about Stephen's phrase, however, is its oblique but unmistakable echo of Bloom's nickname for his son, Rudy. Does Stephen possess some unconscious awareness of the link between wool and the Blooms' deceased infant? And, if so, how may this awareness figure in the association that Bloom forms later in the day between Rudy and Stephen? In Hades he meditates on Simon Dedalus' pride in his living son and on his own misery in having lost his male heir. In the passage from Oxen quoted above, the thought of having lost Rudy makes him think ruefully of Stephen, \"his friend's son.\""

The three buildings stand one block northwest of the park in \"Mountjoy square,\" near Dublin's northeastern edge, and not far east of the Bloom's house in Eccles Street.",
    "expandedNote": " The church of St. Francis Xavier, often called the Gardiner Street Church, was built between 1829 and 1832 by architect John B. Keane, immediately after Catholic Emancipation in 1829. One of the better looking churches in Dublin, it reflects the influence of models in Paris and Italy. A Regency-style \"presbytery,\" or domicile for priests, and a matching convent were constructed on either side of the church, both of them featuring handsome doorways, plasterwork, fireplaces, and other fittings in an expression of national Catholic pride. The Jesuit priests of the church also served as chaplains in the convent. Today, the church and the presbytery are preserved by inclusion on Dublin's Record of Protected Structures, but the convent was unaccountably omitted. As of 2016 it was being offered for sale, and it appears to have been converted into a hostel.\n Although none of the action of Ulysses takes place inside the church, readers of Dubliners will recognize it as the site of the religious retreat led by Father Purdon in \"Grace.\" In the short story Martin Cunningham plays up the Jesuits to Tom Kernan as \"the grandest order in the church.\" Mr. Power chimes in that they are a \"fine body of men.\" Mr. M'Coy adds that \"The Jesuits cater for the upper classes.\" As Gifford notes, the Mountjoy Square area was \"relatively fashionable\" at the time represented in the novel, though today it is \"sliding into dereliction.\"\n After his rather shabby treatment of St. Xavier's in Dubliners,Joyce seems to have made amends in Ulysses. In Eumaeus, Bloom displays pride in Molly's having performed splendidly in \"the jesuit fathers' church in upper Gardiner street\" as one of the soloists in Rossini's Stabat Mater, \"the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hear her with virtuosos, or virtuosi rather. There was the unanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and suffice it to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character there was a generally voiced desire for an encore.\""

The \"library of Saint Genevieve,\" located on the Place du Panthéon, contains a large salle de lecture that is magnificent but utterly lacking in overhead illumination. It would have been quite dramatically dark as Stephen read there \"night by night,\" and he takes the darkness as a metaphor for his own mind. On the desks were \"glowlamps\" that cast circles of light for reading.",
    "expandedNote": " Gifford notes that, according to the 1907 edition of Baedeker's Paris and Its Environs, the library was full of students in the evening hours. During those dark hours, he suggests, the arching iron frame beneath the room's roof creates the effect of being in a cave, bringing to mind passages from Blake's The Marriage of Heaven and Hell: \"I was in a Printing house in Hell, & saw the method in which knowledge is transmitted from generation to generation. . . . In the first chamber was a Dragon-Man, clearing away the rubbish from a cave's mouth; within, a number of Dragons were hollowing the cave.\" \n Blake's demonic dragon-men are associated, in Stephen's thought as in the poem, with writers, bookmakers, and libraries. He sees in his own mind \"a sloth of the underworld, reluctant, shy of brightness, shifting her dragon scaly folds.\" The images of darkness and light in this passage represent one of many ways in which Stephen reinterprets Christian values, in this case by embracing Blake's idea that \"hellish\" and \"heavenly\" qualities unite in the human psyche."

By 1904 the noble building had descended to serving as a warehouse for a seed business. There, Ned Lambert is giving a historical tour to the Reverend Hugh C. Love, a visitor to Dublin from a town about twenty miles west.",
    "expandedNote": " The chapter house on Meetinghouse Lane was built ca. 1200 as part of what was then a Cistercian abbey, which ceased to exist in the late 1530s with Henry VIII's Dissolution of the Monasteries. Stones from the abbey buildings were gradually salvaged for other purposes, including the construction of the Essex (now Grattan) Bridge across the Liffey in the 1600s. In 1904 the chapter house building was owned by the Alexander & Co. seed merchants, whose offices were around the corner at 2-5 Mary's Lane. The remains of the abbey were declared a national monument in 1941, and the chapter house can now be visited from mid-June to mid-September. \n Gifford quotes from D. A. Chart's The Story of Dublin (London, 1907): \"The Chapter House, which must have been a lofty and splendid room, has been divided into two stories by the building of a floor half way up its walls. In the upper chamber, a loft used for storing sacks, the beautifully groined stone roof remains intact, looking very incongruous amidst its surroundings. The upper part of an old window is still visible. In the lower story the ancient architecture is concealed by the brickwork of wine vaults\" (276-77). \n Chapter houses were spaces where all the members of a monastery (or the clergy of a cathedral) could meet to conduct business. In medieval times it was common for monarchs and other nobles to commandeer them for affairs of state, and this one was no exception. The Reverend Love has come to visit the St. Mary's chapter house because of his interest in the history of the Irish aristocracy, and Ned Lambert proudly describes it as \"the most historic spot in all Dublin.\" It was indeed here that \"silken Thomas proclaimed himself a rebel in 1534,\" renouncing his allegiance to the English crown on the basis of a mistaken report that his father, the 9th Earl of Kildare, had been executed by Henry VIII.\n The clergyman plans to make a return trip to photograph the vaulted roof over the room where the grain sacks are stored. Ned Lambert promises to clear some bags away from the windows, and suggests a couple of \"points of vantage\" where a camera could be set up. Today that task has been admirably accomplished by Andy Sheridan, in the photograph reproduced here."

    "note": " Thoughts of Ireland's most famous patron saint float regularly into the novel's dialogue and interior monologue. Some require no comment: a mention of \"Saint Patrick's Day\" here, a character swearing \"by Saint Patrick\" there, or an invocation of \"the blessing of God and Mary and Patrick on you.\" But the colorful legends associated with this early Christian missionary, not one of them documented during his lifetime, take characters and readers down some obscure winding paths.",
    "expandedNote": " Pádraic, or Patricius as he calls himself in his Latin Confessio and a single Latin letter, was—assuming he actually existed—a Romanized Briton with some close connections to Roman Gaul. He was probably born in the late 380s AD and probably died in the early 460s. Raiders enslaved him as a teenager and brought him to Ireland, where he herded sheep for six years before escaping to the continent. From Gaul, he returned to Ireland in 432 on a mission from Pope Celestine I, and supposedly converted the entire island to Christianity within his lifetime, without any bloodshed. He is celebrated on his supposed deathday, March 17. \n Fittingly for an ad salesman, Bloom seems most interested in how this talented missionary succeeded so well at persuading the violent pagan warriors of the island to accept the Christian dispensation—a sales job that has never quite worked on Bloom himself. In Lotus Eaters he thinks, \"Clever idea Saint Patrick the shamrock.\" According to legend, Patrick used one of these three-leaved clover shoots to illustrate the Christian doctrine of the Trinity. In Lestrygonians Bloom gets off one of his better jokes of the day when he thinks of another of Patrick's adventures in sales: \"That last pagan king of Ireland Cormac in the schoolpoem choked himself at Sletty southward of the Boyne. Wonder what he was eating. Something galoptious. Saint Patrick converted him to Christianity. Couldn’t swallow it all however.\"\n Bloom is mistaking one pagan king for another, under the influence of a 19th century poem that he learned in school. The great Cormac, son of Art, reigned during the 3rd century, so Patrick could not possibly have interacted with him, but legend holds that he did convert to Christianity, thereby so angering the druid priests of the existing faith that they cursed the king and caused him to choke on his food. According to the Annals of the Four Masters, it was a salmon bone. Bloom's revery is prompted by watching the diners in the Burton \"Working tooth and jaw\" and thinking, \"Don't. O! A bone!\"\n The poem by Sir Samuel Ferguson (1810-86), 28 quatrains on \"The Burial of King Cormac,\" was first published in Lays of the Western Gael in 1864. It says that Cormac \"choked upon the food he ate / At Sletty, southward of the Boyne.\" The poem improbably relates that, as the king choked to death, he managed to find breath enough to say, \"Spread not the beds of Brugh for me, / When restless death-bed's use is done: / But bury me at Rossnaree, / And face me to the rising sun. / For all the kings who lie in Brugh / Put trust in gods of wood and stone; / And 'twas at Ross that first I knew / One, unseen, who is God alone.\" \n The ruler who couldn't quite swallow the saint's teachings, as opposed to his dinner, was Leary (Laoghaire), who according to the Four Masters had been High King for four years when Patrick arrived in 432. He did not agree to convert but allowed Patrick to proceed with his missionary work. In Ithaca Bloom somehow finds occasion to recite his confusion of the two kings to Stephen, who sets him straight on Cormac being the \"last pagan king\": \"Bloom assented covertly to Stephen’s rectification of the anachronism involved in assigning the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to christianity from druidism by Patrick son of Calpornus, son of Potitus, son of Odyssus, sent by pope Celestine I in the year 432 in the reign of Leary to the year 260 or thereabouts in the reign of Cormac MacArt († 266 A.D.), suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty and interred at Rossnaree.\"\n As it happens, Stephen has actually been thinking earlier in the day about such historically impossible meetings of great figures. In Scylla and Charybdis he muses about \"Oisin with Patrick.\" Medieval oral traditions held that Oisin (Oisín), warrior-poet son of Finn MacCool (Fionn MacCumhail) and historian of the legendary Fenians (Fianna), survived for 200 years after the end of the heroic age because he left with his bride Niamh for her land of Tír na nÓg, a place off the western coast of Ireland where time has no meaning or reality and nothing ages. When he returned to visit his father in Ireland, he found Fionn and his entire way of life gone, and he himself became old, blind, and enfeebled, but there was Patrick, eager both to teach Oisin the true faith and to learn about the Fianna from him. \n In some Christian tales Patrick succeeds in converting Oisin, but in pagan versions Oisin more than holds his own, vigorously defending his pagan beliefs and values against \"Patrick of the closed mind\" and his small-minded religion. None of Stephen's thoughts about the meeting of the two men are given, but since he thinks of it in relation to his own Parisian encounter with a truculent John Millicent Synge, it seems likely that he is recalling the more argumentative versions.\n Other famous legends about Patrick come up in the chapter most associated with Irish nationalism, Cyclops. Patrick appears in its long list of saints and also in the mention of \"Croagh Patrick,\" the holy mountain on the ocean's edge in County Mayo where the saint is supposed to have fasted for 40 days and expelled all of Ireland's snakes, which are sometimes read allegorically as representing the druids. The Citizen seems to be thinking of this lore when he vituperates Bloom, another representative of a false faith, as a poisonous \"thing\" to be driven out: \"Saint Patrick would want to land again at Ballykinlar and convert us, says the citizen, after allowing things like that to contaminate our shores.\" Ballykinler, a village 30 miles south of Belfast in Ulster's County Down, sits on Dundrum Bay, which is one reputed site of Patrick's arrival in Ireland. \n Cyclops also mentions \"S. Patrick's Purgatory,\" another geographical site associated with the saint's miracles. This one is in County Donegal, in the far northwest. Station Island in Lough Derg contained a deep pit or \"cave\" which Christ, in a vision, showed Patrick to be an entrance to Purgatory. The belief arose that pilgrims who spent a day and a night in this pit would experience the effects of Purgatory, suffering the torments appropriate to their sins and tasting the joys of salvation. From the 12th century to the 17th, pilgrims thronged to the site. The practice was revived in the 19th century, accounting for its mention in Cyclops, and it continues today, as evoked in Seamus Heaney's long collection Station Island (1984). \n In the Middle Ages pilgrims typically went first to Saints Island, a larger piece of land near the shore, and then rowed to Patrick's island. The 17th century map reproduced here shows boatloads of pilgrims approaching the shores of Station Island and the \"Caverna Purgatory,\" which today is covered by a mound supporting a bell tower for the adjacent church. The filling in of the cave would seem to have occurred in the 1650s, when Oliver Cromwell's soldiers desecrated the site in his campaign to suppress Irish Catholicism. The map with its indication of a cave was published in 1666, however, so perhaps the date is later. In any case, pressures to shut down the pilgrimage site had been building ever since the papacy issued bans against it just before and after the year 1500.\n Cyclops makes brilliant comedy out of another famous aspect of Patrick's hagiography: his saint's day, March 17. This is traditionally regarded as the date of his death, though no reliable records exist. The 19th century poet and songwriter Samuel Lover wrote a bit of comical verse making fun of the arbitrary date, but he connected it to the saint's birthday. According to \"The Birth of S. Patrick,\" the first factional fight in Irish history was over the question of whether Patrick's true birthdate was March 8 or March 9. One Father Mulcahy persuaded the combatants to combine the two numbers and settle on March 17. Having done so, \"they all got blind drunk—which complated their bliss, / And we keep up the practice from that day to this.\"\n Joyce turns this contention over dates into a brawl with assorted deadly weapons between members of the Friends Of The Emerald Isle who have come to witness the execution: \"An animated altercation (in which all took part) ensued among the F. O. T. E. I. as to whether the eighth or the ninth of March was the correct date of the birth of Ireland's patron saint.\" A Constable MacFadden is summoned and proposes \"the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending parties.\" The quick acceptance of the policeman's proposal seems to have much to do with the fact that he is described as \"The readywitted nine footer.\"\n Joyce continued his engagement with the mythology of Saint Patrick in Finnegans Wake. In the summer of 1923 he worked on a sketch of \"St Patrick and the Druid\" inspired by stories of the saint's encounter with King Leary and his archdruids, who were encamped on the Hill of Tara. Patrick is said to have camped on the nearby Hill of Slane and built a paschal fire on the night before Easter, alarming the druids who held that all fires must be extinguished before a new one was lit on Tara. They told the king said that if this one was not put out it would burn forever. \n Traditionally, this story is told as a Christian victory, but in Joyce's sketch, which he referred to as \"the conversion of St Patrick by Ireland,\" a druid named Berkeley meets Patrick in the presence of the king and does all the talking, teaching the Christian his idealistic theory of light and color by discussing the \"sextuple\" (or, alternately, \"heptachromatic sevenhued\") colors displayed in King Leary's person (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet), all of which turn out to be shades of botanic green. \n This sketch fed into several parts of the Wake, including its spectrum of rainbow colors and the phrase on its first page, \"nor avoice from afire bellowsed mishe mishe to tauftauf thuartpeatrick.\" Joyce reworked the sketch extensively near the end of the book. On pp. 611-12, the archdruid Balkelly (a Shem figure) and \"his mister guest Patholic\" (Shaun) continue the discussion of light, color, and vision. The druid again uses \"High Thats Hight Uberking Leary\" as the example of his impractical way of seeing, but this time Patholic has the last word, invoking the sun of everyday seeing and the Great Balenoarch (the Italian for rainbow is arcobaleno) of the world's apparent colors. \n In a 17 March 2015 blog post that discusses the presence of Patrick and the druid in the Wake, Peter Chrisp concludes by observing how important this saint was to Joyce. The Swiss writer Mercanton, Chrisp observes, talked to Joyce as he basked in the late sunlight one evening on the Quay de Lutry. Mercanton recorded that he \"spoke of St Patrick, whose intercession was indispensable if he was to complete the book.\" Joyce said, \"I follow St Patrick . . . It is the title of an erudite book by my friend Gogarty . . . Without the help of my Irish saint, I think I could never have got to the end of it.\" Chrisp ends by noting that \"Gogarty's book was found on Joyce's desk after his death.\""

(Chorea comes from the ancient Greek choreia = dance.) In recent medical practice Saint Vitus' Dance, which affects the feet, hands, and face, has come to be known as Sydenham's chorea. It often afflicts children who have had rheumatic fever or other streptococcal infections.",

Trapped within a dysfunctional body, the boy also introduces the reader to the Homeric condition of Circean enchantment, in which rational individuals are plunged into groteque animal corporeality."

    "expandedNote": " The souls in Dante's afterlife can see the future. In Paradiso Cacciaguida tells Dante that he will be banished from the great city-state of his birth and forced into an itinerant existence, wandering about the Italian peninsula in search of shelter, protection, and patronage. Florentines put little salt in their breads, so even his daily bread will discomfit him:\n You will leave behind every delightful thing\n You most love; and this is the arrow\n That the bow of exile first shoots.\nYou will discover how full of salt\n Is the bread of another, and how hard the way\n Going down and up another’s stairs. \n (17.55-60, my trans.)\n Stephen, who has been going up and (just now) down the stairs of Mulligan’s tower, contemplates handing over the key and becoming utterly dishoused: “Give him the key too. All.” \n At about this time in Joyce's own life (1900-1904), he was beginning to think of himself as a writer-in-exile. Ellmann notes that Henrik Ibsen's warm acknowledgement of the essay \"Ibsen's New Drama\" that Joyce published in the Fortnightly Review in 1900 encouraged the young man to think of himself as standing \"aloof\" from his peers (74). \"Before Ibsen's letter Joyce was an Irishman,\" Ellmann observes; \"after it he was a European\" (75). He read all the late nineteenth century European literature he could get his hands on, and much else besides; \"He continued his study of Dante, so that it was easy for Oliver Gogarty to dub him a little later the Dante of Dublin\" (75). \n In December 1902 Joyce departed from Kingstown pier for his first exile on the Continent. In October 1904 he left again, with Nora, this time for good. Of the first departure Ellmann remarks, \"He was not yet using the word 'exile,' but there are hints of it in his letter to Lady Gregory. Joyce needed exile as a reproach to others and a justification of himself. His feeling of ostracism from Dublin lacked, as he was well aware, the moral decisiveness of his hero Dante's exile from Florence, in that he kept the keys to the gate. He was neither bidden to leave nor forbidden to return, and after this first departure he was in fact to go back five times. But, like other revolutionaries, he fattened on opposition and grew thin and pale when treated with indulgence\" (109). In A Portrait of the Artist Stephen declares that the tenets of his artistic caling will be \"silence, exile, and cunning.\""

    "note": " Bloom's nightmarish vision of a blasted Palestine in Calypso afflicts him viscerally: \"Grey horror seared his flesh. . . . Cold oils slid along his veins, chilling his blood: age crusting him with a salt cloak.\" The allusion to Lot's wife, a continuation of his earlier contemplation of the Lot story, casts Bloom as an aging man looking back on his best years, feeling that life has passed him by. Later chapters confirm this destructive fixation on lost happiness: the trauma of losing a child has crippled his sexual life, and he cannot move beyond it.",
    "expandedNote": " In Genesis 19 one of the angels tells Lot, \"Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed\" (17). Lot argues with the divine command and is allowed to escape to Zoar rather than climbing into the mountains. As he and his family enter the town, fiery destruction rains down on the other cities of the plain. \"But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt\" (26). Various explanations have been advanced for this odd punishment. One allegorical reading, relevant to Bloom, holds that Lot's wife was blasted because, by looking back, she showed her continuing attachment to her old life in Sodom. \n § Bloom's salt-encrusted paralysis suggests the peril inherent in dwelling sorrowfully on the failures in one's past. Throughout this day he will dwell on the infant death of his second child, a tragedy that has blighted the sexual bloom of his marriage and made him feel like an evolutionary dead end. Although the loss is not mentioned in Calypso, his preoccupation with sterility clearly shows how much it occupies his thoughts: \"A barren land, bare waste. . . . It bore the oldest, the first race. . . . The oldest people. . . . multiplying, dying, being born everywhere. It lay there now. Now it could bear no more. Dead: an old woman's: the grey sunken cunt of the world.\"\n In Hades Bloom thinks of Rudy's death not only as a trauma but as a personal failing: \"If it's healthy it's from the mother. If not from the man. Better luck next time.\" In Lestrygonians he recognizes that grief has undermined his sexual relationship with Molly: \"I was happier then. . . . When we left Lombard street west something changed. Could never like it again after Rudy. Can't bring back time.\" In Sirens he thinks that his procreative days have probably ended with the loss of his one male heir: \"Last of my race. Milly young student. Well, my fault perhaps. No son. Rudy. Too late now. Or if not? If not? If still?\" \n There is an immense personal component, then, to Bloom's fantasy of Palestine as a dead land and the Jews as a geriatric race. Looking at the facts of his personal life—a dead son, an arrested sex life, a wife looking elsewhere for satisfaction, a maturing daughter, an age past the midpoint of the biblically allotted threescore and ten—Bloom sees himself on a downward slope. Looking back in this way is deadly. Several paragraphs later in Calypso, the motif of a backward glance will return. The context and the literary allusion are different, but they imply the same need not to substitute regret for forward motion."

  "050045samaritan": {
    "note": " If anyone in Ulysses can be called a good Samaritan it is Leopold Bloom, and the first sentence of Eumaeus shows him acting explicitly and exactly like the one in the Bible: \"Preparatory to anything else Mr Bloom brushed off the greater bulk of the shavings and handed Stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up generally in orthodox Samaritan fashion which he very badly needed.\" But Lotus Eaters slyly undercuts this altruism by having Bloom recall the question posed to Jesus just before the parable: \"Who is my neighbour?\" He thinks of it as he imagines checking out anonymous women in St. Andrew's church.",
    "expandedNote": " Luke's gospel recounts an unbeliever's challenge which Jesus answers by invoking the two ancient commandments of Deuteronomy: \"And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou? And he answering said, Thou shalt love thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself. And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live. But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour?\" (10.25-29).\n Jesus answers the lawyer's implicitly selfish question with the parable of a Jew who travels from Jerusalem to Jericho and runs into thieves who rob him of his clothes, wound him, and leave him \"half dead\" by the side of the road. A priest happens by, sees the man, prudently crosses to the other side of the road, and passes on. A Levite does the same thing. But a passing Samaritan, one of a sect that was bitterly at odds with the Jews, \"had compassion on him, And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him\" (10.34). Which of these three men, Jesus asks, do you think was a \"neighbour\"? The lawyer can only say, the Samaritan, and Jesus tells him, \"Go thou and do likewise.\"\n Joyce scrupulously reproduces the biblical story: military thugs knock Stephen to the ground, where he appears half dead, and it is a member of a despised race, not one of Dublin's Christians, that helps him to his feet, restores his scattered articles of clothing, escorts him to a place of safety and recuperation (a cabman's shelter, standing in for the inn), physically supports him as he staggers out, and takes him into his own home. Bloom's action is admirable, but this mock-heroic novel will not let him play the part of a hero in any straightforward, sentimentally inspiring way. His words in Eumaeus, the prose style of the narrative itself, and his less than completely disinterested relationship to Stephen hold the reader at an ironic distance from any saint's worship.\n And then there is the weird allusion to Luke 10 eleven chapters earlier. Bloom steps into the church, sees that there are not many people in it, only some members of a women's sodality, and thinks, \"Pity so empty. Nice discreet place to be next some girl. Who is my neighbour?\" His logic seems to be that if the church were more crowded, he could sit down beside some pretty girl and worship her from anear. If charitable love can be extended to strangers, why not libidinous love as well? The distinction between caritas and cupiditas is Augustinian, not biblical, but Joyce seems to be using it to add a Bloomian layer of polymorphous perversity (\"free love and a free lay church in a free lay state,\" as Circe wickedly puts it) to Jesus' admonition to love selflessly. In Calypso Bloom directs his erotic attention to \"the nextdoor girl\" in the butcher shop. Now he asks \"Who is my neighbour?\" and justifies lusting after complete strangers."

The melon he had he held against my face. Smiled: creamfruit smell. That was the rule, said. In. Come. Red carpet spread. You will see who.\"\n Harun al-Rashid (ca. 765-809) was the fifth Caliph of the Abbasid Caliphate, which ruled territory from north Africa to the borders of India from its capital in Baghdad, a new metropolis established close to Persia to enable the triumphant Arabs to draw on Persian expertise in governing. His name means Harun the Just, or Harun the Rightly Guided, and his reign initiated what has come to be known as the Golden Age of Islam, when arts, sciences, and philosophy flourished. He was famed for maintaining a sumptuous court. Thornton notes that \"He is known primarily through his role in several of the Arabian Nights tales. 'Sinbad the Sailor' is set during his caliphate.\" Gifford adds that \"He is reputed to have disguised himself and wandered among his people to keep himself aware of their moods and concerns.\" Gifford argues for a Middle Eastern provenance of \"the rule\" as well: \"Stephen's dream involves the Hebraic 'rule' that the firstfruits of the land were to be brought to the holy place of God's choice and there presented to the priests.\" \n Later, at the end of Scylla and Charybdis, Stephen remembers something that happened before the encounter with the strange man: \"Last night I flew. Easily flew. Men wondered. Street of harlots after. A creamfruit melon he held to me. In. You will see.\" Dreams of flying like Stephen's are a kind of lucid dreaming, in which the dreamer can control his movements through the air. They are typically exhilarating, accompanied by feelings of power and liberation.\n The Haroun part of Stephen's dream is clearly precognitive, since on June 16 Leopold Bloom will befriend Stephen in the red-light district, take him home to 7 Eccles Street, make him cocoa, and offer to introduce him to his wife, whom he associates with melons and other fruit. The narrative acknowledges this prophetic quality by identifying Bloom with Haroun twice in Circe. As Bello is marting him to buyers in the sex trade and some foreigner bids \"Hoondert punt sterlink,\" hushed voices say, \"For the Caliph. Haroun Al Raschid.\" Later in the chapter, when Bloom tells Bella that he knows she has a son in Oxford, she says, \"(Almost speechless.) Who are. Incog!\" Not long after, incognito Bloom takes off into the street after Stephen: \"Zoe and Kitty still point right. Bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his caliph's hood and poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face. Incog Haroun al Raschid he flits behind the silent lechers and hastens on by the railings.\"\n Stephen cannot hear the narrative identifying Bloom with the Caliph, but before he realizes that he has any particular connection with Bloom, he feels that the events of the dream are coming true: \"It was here. Street of harlots. In Serpentine avenue Beelzebub showed me her, a fubsy widow. Where's the red carpet spread?\" His talk sounds wild, and Bloom attempts to calm him down, but Stephen becomes even more excited: \"No, I flew. My foes beneath me. And ever shall be. World without end. (He cries) Pater! Free!\" Answering the call to a Dedalean father, Simon Dedalus appears as a flying companion: \"He swoops uncertainly through the air, wheeling, uttering cries of heartening, on strong ponderous buzzard wings.\""

  "020075samewisdom": {
    "note": " Many details in Nestor, and not just the prominence of horses and cattle in the chapter, invite a comparison between Mr. Deasy and the wise old counselor to whom Homer's Telemachus goes for advice in the Odyssey. But the analogy seems mostly ironic, and Stephen feels oppressed by \"the same wisdom\" as on his last two visits to the headmaster's office—unwanted advice, like a noose around his neck.",
    "expandedNote": " Athena, disguised as Mentor, advises Telemachus to journey to Pylos to seek news of his father from Nestor: \"Go to old Nestor, master charioteer, / so we may broach the storehouse of his mind.\" Deasy's invitation to Stephen, \"Will you wait in my study,\" implies some wisdom on Deasy's part. It is also the place where Deasy will pay Stephen his month's wages, picking up on the metaphor of Nestor's mind as a storehouse. Stephen thinks, \"And now his strongroom for the gold.\"\n Athena urges Telemachus to \"Ask him with courtesy,\" and overcomes Telemachus' reluctance when he objects that \"for a young man to interrogate an old man / Seems disrespectful.\" Stephen treats his employer with impeccable courtesy, but he has no interest, bashful or otherwise, in interrogating him. Rather, it is Deasy who interrogates Stephen, badgering him with condescending and corrective questions and observations. \n Athena says that Nestor must have wisdom because his \"rule goes back over three generations,\" and Telemachus believes that he must know \"the ways of men\" because he is \"so old, it seems death cannot touch him.\" Deasy is old, he is a unionist who identifies with Ireland's rulers, and he feels qualified to speak about Irish history because \"I saw three generations since O'Connell's time.\" But his knowledge of the ways of men is undercut by his utter lack of resemblance to Daniel O'Connell.\n Athena says that Nestor \"will tell you history and no lies.\" Deasy's history is full of lies: that his ancestor Sir John Blackwood planned to vote for the Union, that \"the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the union,\" that there has been a conspiracy to sabotage Irish shipping interests, that women have sabotaged political order throughout history, that the Jews \"sinned against the light,\" that Ireland \"never persecuted the Jews\" and has never had a Jewish population, that an international Jewish conspiracy is undermining the nations of Europe. \n In his lack of respect for authority Stephen is much like the young Joyce, who was utterly unwilling to accept direction from his elders. Ellmann records a meeting with William Butler Yeats in which the young and completely unaccomplished writer impertinently asked the great poet how old he was. Yeats answered, and with a sigh Joyce replied, \"I thought as much. I have met you too late. You are too old\" (103). The meeting in Deasy's study represents one of several instances in the book in which Stephen finds the advice of an older man useless. The only exceptions to this pattern are Almidano Artifoni and Leopold Bloom."

  "030081sandalshoon": {
    "note": " Stephen thinks of Hamlet yet again near the end of Proteus, in reference to his personal attire: \"My cockle hat and staff and hismy sandal shoon.\" He is quoting from the song that Ophelia sings in her mad scene (Hamlet 4.5), lamenting a lover who has proved untrue.",
    "expandedNote": " Pilgrims to the shrine of Saint James in Compostela traditionally carried a long staff, with a knob or hook near the top, and wore a hat decorated with a scallop shell. The hat was often called a \"cockle hat\" because cockles are close relatives of scallops, biologically and linguistically. (The Latin word conchylium meant shellfish, mussel, or oyster. The French word coquille means shell, and can refer to scallops.) Beginning with some of the later troubadours, love poetry often characterized the true lover as a pilgrim, and this metaphor became a commonplace in Elizabethan poetry. (Its best-known expression is probably the shared sonnet in Romeo and Juliet 1.5.) Ophelia's song draws on all this accumulated cultural capital in distinguishing loyal from faithless love:\n How should I your true-love know,\n From another one?\n By his cockle hat and staff,\n And his sandal shoon.\n The song goes on to grieve Polonius' death and to note that no \"true-love showers\" bewailed his burial. It concludes with the story of a young maid who has sex with her true love and then is abandoned by him. The entire song clearly bears on Hamlet, who killed Polonius and deserted Ophelia.\nStephen is well-attired to play the part of the Shakespearean pilgrim. He has a hat (\"my Hamlet hat\"), a staff (his ashplant), and what he called \"borrowed sandals\" eleven paragraphs earlier (the perforated \"brogues\" that he has borrowed from Mulligan, hence \"hismy\"). But why should he characterize himself as a true, or false, lover? He has been wishing, nine paragraphs earlier in the text, for some woman to rescue him (\"Touch me. Soft eyes. Soft soft soft hand. I am lonely here. O, touch me soon, now. What is that word known to all men? I am quiet here alone. Sad too. Touch, touch me\"), a wish that associates him with Joyce's discovery of true love. Since he so clearly associates Hamlet with artistic inspiration, perhaps one can hear in this allusion some recognition that he must be a lover before he can be a writer."

  "040024sandow": {
    "note": " The \"Sandow's exercises\" that Bloom thinks about in Calypso and Circe come from a book that sits on his bookshelves, \"Eugen Sandow's Physical Strength and How to Obtain It.\" Sandow was internationally famous as a \"body-builder\" (he coined the term), and he became a kind of guru of physical fitness in the 1890s and early 1900s. Ireland went gaga over him after an 1898 series of performances.",
    "expandedNote": " Friedrich Wilhelm Müller, born in Prussia in 1867, gave himself the stage name Eugen Sandow when he began performing in European circuses in the 1880s. In addition to performing staggering feats of strength, he adopted poses that would highlight particular aspects of his musculature, as professional bodybuilders do today. In the 1890s Sandow opened schools that taught exercise routines, healthy diets, and weight training. He published a monthly magazine called Physical Culture starting in 1898, wrote several books (which included charts prescribing amounts of weight and numbers of repetitions), invented new kinds of exercise equipment, and championed isometric exercises (merely tightening and releasing muscle groups) as a complement to weight-lifting. \n In addition to performing internationally, Sandow organized bodybuilding competitions, trained soldiers, and served for a while as a personal trainer to King George V. In May 1898 he delivered a run of spectacular performances in Dublin's Empire Palace Theatre. More than 1,300 people came on the first night to see him effortlessly lift enormous dumbbells, throw human beings around like beanbags, rip three decks of playing cards stacked on top of one another, and lift up a platform containing a piano while the pianist continued playing on it. Sandow enjoyed a sky-high reputation in Ireland for many years after the 1898 tour, and sold many copies of his books as well as the Sandow Developer, a pulley system for dumbbells that anticipated modern weight-lifting machines. A good account of the Irish Sandow craze can be found at www.theirishstory.com.\n Sandow's most famous book, Strength and How to Obtain It (1897)—Joyce got the title slightly wrong—supplied a chart for recording measurements of particular muscle groups, so that the practitioner could track their growing size. Ithaca observes that these \"indoor exercises . . . designed particularly for commercial men engaged in sedentary occupations, were to be made with mental concentration in front of a mirror so as to bring into play the various families of muscles and produce successively a pleasant rigidity, a more pleasant relaxation and the most pleasant repristination of juvenile agility.\" Later, when it details the contents of Bloom's desk drawer, the chapter mentions \"a chart of the measurements of Leopold Bloom compiled before, during and after 2 months' consecutive use of Sandow-Whiteley's pulley exerciser (men's 15/-, athlete's 20/-) viz. chest 28 in and 29 1/2 in, biceps 9 in and 10 in, forearm 8 1/2 in and 9 in, thigh 10 in and 12 in, calf 11 in and 12 in.\"\n Alas, like many later 20th and 21st century individuals who have purchased exercise advice and exercise equipment, Bloom suffered a lapse of enthusiasm after his two months of faithful adherence. Ithaca notes that his Sandow's routines were \"formerly intermittently practised, subsequently abandoned.\" In Calypso, his brief plunge into black gloom on Dorset Street makes him resolve to improve his physical conditioning: \"Morning mouth bad images. Got up wrong side of the bed. Must begin again those Sandow's exercises.\" In Circe, a near encounter with a tram causes him to renew the resolution: \"Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow's exercises again.\"\n Sandow advocated what he called the \"Grecian ideal\" of male beauty, shaping his own body to measurements of muscles that he took from statues in museums. Bloom's interest in the Sandow ideal is clearly of a piece with his admiration for the standards of beauty embodied in Greek statues, both male and female. His mimetic desire for the one and sublimated sexual desire for the other merge with any purer aesthetic appreciations he may have, making his response to this great art form as much \"kinetic\" as \"static,\" in the terms that Stephen propounds in Part 5 of A Portrait of the Artist.\n [2019] Bloom's conscious thoughts about Sandow are limited to desiring physical strength, but his mimetic attraction to this brilliant self-promoter may express professional envy as well. As Vike Martina Plock observes in Joyce, Medicine, and Modernity (UP of Florida, 2010), \"Both physically and commercially Sandow has achieved what Leopold Bloom can only dream of: physical superiority and professional success in advertising\" (119). Sandow's books and magazine, his theatrical triumphs, his classes, his exercise products, his marketing of his services as a consultant, his modeling for photographs: Bloom would count himself fortunate to achieve any one of these commercial successes.\n In a personal communication, fitness trainer and writer Andrew Heffernan adds several other interesting pieces of information. Sandow completely changed the look of weight-lifters: \"Prior to him, strongmen were thick-waisted beer-guzzling bears.\" In order to accentuate the resemblance to ancient statues, he would cover himself in white powder that gave his body the appearance of having been carved from marble. And Sandow \"was—and remains—the model for the trophy given annually to the winner of the Mr. Olympia contest—bodybuilding's top prize.\" Heffernan's photograph of one of these trophies appears here."

  "030001sandymount": {
    "note": " When Stephen thinks \"I am here\" at the beginning of Proteus, he is standing somewhere on \"Sandymount strand,\" the beach and tide flats east of the suburb of Sandymount on Dublin's southeast periphery. The action of Nausicaa takes place on the same stretch of shoreline. And both episodes of Ulysses invite comparison with the passage at the end of Part IV of A Portrait of the Artist in which Stephen walks along a beach on the north side of the Liffey, near Dollymount.",
    "expandedNote": " Between the end of Nestor and the beginning of Proteus, Stephen has moved from Mr. Deasy's school in Dalkey, south of the tower at Sandycove, to Sandymount strand northwest of the tower. The novel does not represent that journey or give any hints as to how it may have happened. Did Stephen walk the whole way, or take public transportation? In James Joyce's Dublin: A Topographical Guide to the Dublin of Ulysses (Thames & Hudson, 2004), Ian Gunn and Clive Hart infer that Stephen must have caught the 10:00 train from Bray at Dalkey Station, at 10:10, arriving at Westland Row Station in the city at 10:42 and then walking east along Great Brunswick Street towards the strand (28-31).\n The Sandymount strand opens onto a vast tidal flat that becomes exposed at every ebb tide, allowing walkers to venture far out from the land. After venturing a short distance onto these flats, Stephen heads in the direction of the South Wall, spends some time there, and then journeys toward Dublin, where he will spend the rest of the day. This last action, like the passage from Dalkey to Sandymount, is not represented in the novel. We next meet Stephen in the newspaper office on Prince's Street in the center of Dublin. Again, the question arises: has he walked the whole way, or caught a tram for some part of it? \n In Nausicaa, the novel returns to \"the weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore,\" to find Gerty MacDowell and her companions (and, soon, Leopold Bloom) sitting in a spot not far from where Stephen began walking at the beginning of Proteus. Nausicaa begins shortly after low tide, but the characters in this episode remain close to shore: nighttime is fast approaching, and they have young children with them.\n In Part IV of A Portrait Stephen walks near the North or Bull Wall that juts out into the sea from Clontarf. A young woman who is wading in the water there accepts \"the worship of his eyes\" much as Gerty MacDowell accepts Bloom's. Like Gerty her wearing of \"slateblue skirts\" may associate her with the Blessed Virgin, while \"the white fringes of her drawers\" excite desire. Both encounters (the one in Nausicaa more strongly sexualized) should be read in the context of Joyce's experience with Nora on the Sandymount strand, an experience that Stephen anticipates in Proteus when he thinks, \"Touch me. Soft eyes. Soft soft soft hand.\""

    "expandedNote": " Sandymount Green is a small triangular park in the center of the suburb, on the site of the original village which was called Brickfield Town. In Nausicaa, which takes place on Sandymount Strand, mention is made of a man who lives near the Green: \"And Gerty, rapt in thought, scarce saw or heard her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off Sandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like himself passing along the strand taking a short walk.\"\n Another tram terminated at \"the Martello tower,\" also mentioned in Nausicaa, about half a mile south and east of the Green on Sandymount strand. This structure should not be confused with the very similar Martello tower at Sandycove where Stephen and Mulligan are living, several miles farther down the coast.\n Gifford observes that \"Many of the final destinations were near one another (as Sandymount green and tower), but the trams followed different routes in a system that in 1904 was regarded as the most efficient and 'modern' in Europe\" (128)."

    "note": " Sheer coincidence or casual borrowing may be at work in Penelope when Molly remembers, from her childhood in Gibraltar, the beauty of \"the sardines and the bream in Catalan bay round the back of the rock they were fine all silver in the fishermens baskets\"—but the resemblance to one of Ezra Pound's fine short lyrics possibly constitutes a kind of homage.",
    "expandedNote": " Pound, of course, befriended Joyce and helped him in numerous ways in the ten years leading up to the publication of Ulysses. Much more is known about the advice Pound gave Joyce, and the responses he had to his works, than about Joyce's responses to Pound, but the Irishman so familiar with an Italian port might certainly also have been familiar with \"The Study in Aesthetics,\" published in Lustra in 1917:\n The very small children in patched clothing,\n Being smitten with an unusual wisdom,\n Stopped in their play as she passed them\n And cried up from their cobbles:\n Guarda! Ahi, guarda! ch’ è be'a!\n But three years after this\n I heard the young Dante, whose last name I do not know—\n For there are, in Sirmione, twenty-eight young Dantes and thirty-four Catulli;\n And there had been a great catch of sardines,\n And his elders \n Were packing them in the great wooden boxes\n For the market in Brescia, and he\n Leapt about, snatching at the bright fish\n And getting in both of their ways;\n And in vain they commanded him to sta fermo!\n And when they would not let him arrange\n The fish in the boxes\n He stroked those which were already arranged,\n Murmuring for his own satisfaction\n This identical phrase: \n Ch’ è be'a.\n And at this I was mildly abashed.\n Like the young Dante, the young Molly marveled at the silver beauty of the little fish, and she thinks of that epiphany just after remembering an elegant woman at the seashore: herself on a trip to Bray with her husband, with \"my new white shoes all ruined with the saltwater and the hat I had with that feather all blowy and tossed on me how annoying and provoking.\" (Interestingly, she also thinks immediately afterward of \"old Luigi near a hundred they said came from Genoa.\")\n Perhaps one should not make too much of these resemblances. But the embarrassment that Pound's speaker feels as he sees the \"aesthetic\" accomplishments of the human species matched by those of the natural world does have a suggestive counterpart inUlysses. The simple joy that Molly takes in the things of nature offers welcome correctives to the urban mindset embodied in the first seventeen chapters. In that belabored thoughtscape, the most wonder sardines can evoke comes (in Oxen of the Sun) from a literary parody: \"And there was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be possible thing without they see it natheless they are so. And these fishes lie in an oily water brought there from Portugal land because of the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress.\" \n In contrast to her husband, and Stephen, and the book's many clever narrative voices, Molly has remained in contact with the child's wonder at her world: \"God of heaven theres nothing like nature the wild mountains then the sea and the waves rushing then the beautiful country with the fields of oats and wheat and all kinds of things and all the fine cattle going about that would do your heart good to see rivers and lakes and flowers all sorts of shapes and smells and colours springing up even out of the ditches primroses and violets nature it is as for them saying theres no God I wouldnt give a snap of my two fingers for all their learning why dont they go and create something.\""

  "080022sawdust": {
    "note": " In the late 19th and early 20th centuries \"sawdust\" was commonly spread on the floors of pubs, cheap restaurants, butcher shops, and other businesses to soak up spilled drinks, mucus, blood, and worse. Sawdust-covered floors are mentioned in Lestrygonians, Eumaeus, and Circe, and a comment from the narrator in Cyclops suggests that some establishments used \"straw\" from the same purposes.",
    "expandedNote": " In many cities of Ireland, England, and America, if nowhere else, sawdust dealers went around to local businesses every workday, selling fresh supplies of their product. The idea was to change out the dirty material every day, but in practice many businesses simply sprinkled new sawdust on top of the old, and as time wore on sanitation concerns led to the banning of the practice in many cities, especially for businesses where food was produced or sold. At the beginning of \"The Love-Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,\" T. S. Eliot presents an image of the lower-class parts of town that relied on such crude hygiene: \"Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets, / The muttering retreats / Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels, / And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells.\"\n When Bloom stands in Burton's restaurant in Lestrygonians, his nose, ears, stomach, and brain in revolt, sawdust is part of the picture: \"Smells of men. His gorge rose. Spat-on sawdust, sweetish warmish cigarettesmoke, reek of plug, spilt beer, men’s beery piss, the stale of ferment.\" A few paragraphs later in the same chapter, indulging vegetarian thoughts, he thinks of butcher shops: \"Butchers’ buckets wobbly lights. Give us that brisket off the hook. Plup. Rawhead and bloody bones. Flayed glasseyed sheep hung from their haunches, sheepsnouts bloodypapered snivelling nosejam on sawdust.\"\n Given this context, it seems less remarkable (though no less distasteful) that in Barney Kiernan's pub in Cyclops the Citizen \"cleared the spit out of his gullet and, gob, he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner. / —After you with the push, Joe, says he, taking out his handkerchief to swab himself dry.\" Such behavior was clearly accepted in establishments with sawdust on the floor. In the cabman's shelter in Eumaeus, Murphy answers one of Bloom's questions by \"simply letting spurt a jet of spew into the sawdust.\" But Barney Kiernan's apparently uses a different material, because the narrator says that \"if you took up a straw from the bloody floor\" Bloom would find ways to talk about it for an hour. \n In Bella Cohen's brothel it appears that sawdust is used for still more elemental bodily functions. Interrogating Bloom over his interest in the female way of urinating—to which he replies plaintively, \"Science. To compare the various joys we each enjoy. (Earnestly.) And really it’s better the position... because often I used to wet...\"—Bello barks, \"(Sternly.) No insubordination! The sawdust is there in the corner for you. I gave you strict instructions, didn’t I? Do it standing, sir! I’ll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a trace on your swaddles.\" If there are records of sawdust being used in brothels to soak up urine, I have not run across them. But it would not be surprising given the abysmal poverty of North Inner City tenements, and of course wood shavings are used for this purpose in horse stalls and other livestock enclosures.\n Thanks to Vincent Van Wyk for getting me thinking about sawdust on pub floors."

  "040036scapulars": {
    "note": " The \"scapulars\" mentioned in Calypso,Nausicaa, and Circe are Catholic cloth badges that hang from the shoulders (the name derives from thescapula or shoulder blade). Many monks and nuns wear long, shoulder-width, apron-like outer garments called scapulars as part of their habit, but the ones Joyce has in mind are smaller devotional items worn by laypeople. They are usually small rectangles (no more than a few inches on a side) connected by two cords or cloth tapes so that one patch can lie on the chest and the other on the back. Most often, they signify devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary.",
    "expandedNote": " The servant girl that Bloom sees at the butcher shop is wearing \"Brown scapulars in tatters, defending her both ways.\" He is imagining that she wears the Marian devotional images to safeguard her virginity (no penetration from either side), though this is a crude reduction of the religious significance of the practice. \n Brown scapulars (there are various colors) derive from Carmelite devotion to Our Lady of Mount Carmel. Kitty-Kate makes clear in Circe that they are the badges of a sodality of Catholic women. In her case the defense of virginity did not work: \"I forgot myself. In a weak moment I erred and did what I did on Constitution hill. I was confirmed by the bishop and enrolled in the brown scapular. My mother's sister married a Montmorency. It was a working plumber was my ruination when I was pure.\"\n Despite this continuing fixation on the supposed anti-sexual powers of scapulars, Bloom does know that they have a broader protective function. In Nausicaa he thinks of sailors who go off to sea: \"Off he sails with a scapular or a medal on him for luck.\""

  "010046schemas": {
    "note": " When Joyce was completing Ulysses in 1920 and 1921 he produced two elaborate tables, now sometimes called the Linati schema and the Gilbert schema, to help friends understand the design behind \"my damned monster-novel.\" Each table starts with a column of Homeric titles for the eighteen chapters, which appeared without titles both in The Little Review and in the 1922 printing of the novel. Subsequent columns supply various other kinds of identifying information about each chapter. The schemas are fantastic creatures, regarded by many intelligent readers as chimeras, largely unhelpful for reading the novel. But they do possess some hermeneutic value.",
    "expandedNote": " Joyce had always planned for Ulysses to echo events in Homer's poem, and as he wrote early chapters he described them to friends using names drawn from characters and places in the epic. When he began receiving galley proofs from Maurice Darantière in June 1921, and filling the unfortunate printer's margins with elaborate additions to the set text, he revised and extended the Homeric correspondences of earlier chapters to make them consistent with what was evidently becoming a more serious engagement with Homer in later chapters. This compositional process, detailed in Michael Groden's textual study Ulysses in Progress (Princeton UP, 1977), suggests that a reader may be well advised to look for precise narrative correspondences between the novel's 18 chapters and certain parts of Homer's epic tale.\n Nine months earlier, on 21 September 1920, Joyce had sent to his Italian translator Carlo Linati a \"summary-key-skeleton-schema (for home use only)\" that indicated the importance of certain Homeric correspondences, as well as numerous other compositional principles. He listed in hand-written Italian the Title of each chapter (drawn from an episode in the narrative of the Odyssey), the Hour at which its action takes place on June 16, a representative Color (or, in a couple of instances, two colors), some Persons from the Odyssey (presumably meant to correspond to people in the chapter, but not so identified), a narrative Technique (or, often, more than one), a corresponding Science or Art in other fields of intellectual endeavor, a general Significance, a bodily Organ, and a Symbol (several for each chapter). \n Some of the entries on the Linati chart suggest interesting lines of reading, while others, including many of the Homeric persons, seem gratuitous, impenetrably obscure, even bizarre. The schema is long and sprawling, and it multiplies orders of categorization to the point of becoming disorderly. Chapters are numbered in two ways, with a straightforward 1-18 and a confusing 1-3, 1-12, 1-3 emphasizing the novel's division into three parts. Time superscriptures (\"Dawn,\" \"Morning,\" \"Mid-Day,\" \"Day,\" \"Midnight\") detract from the elegant, though oversimplified, assignment of each chapter to a numerical \"hour.\" \n The sprawling and cryptic document does, however, twinkle with glimpses of Joyce's thought processes. One notable example: to explain the absence of \"organs\" for the book's first three chapters, Joyce wrote vertically across those three lines, \"Telemaco non soffre ancora il corpo,\" Telemachus does not yet suffer (endure, bear) a body. \n In November 1921 Joyce produced a revised schema for the writer Valery Larbaud, who was preparing to deliver a lecture on the forthcoming novel in Paris. He also sent a copy to his biographer Herbert Gorman, and it seems that several other people saw versions of this chart during the 1920s, always with the caveat that it was for private use and not to be published, until Joyce finally authorized Stuart Gilbert to publish a copy in his critical study James Joyce's Ulysses (1930).\n The new schema had a slightly varied line of headings: Title, Scene, Hour, Organ, Art, Colour, Symbol, Technic, and Correspondences. Scene was a new category. Significance was omitted. The Correspondences went beyond lists of Persons, noting precise parallels between characters in Ulysses and the Odyssey. The Hour entries do not always agree with those in the Linati schema. Both documents show the day starting at 8:00 (the Linati shows Telemachus and Calypso occurring at \"8-9,\" while the Gilbert assigns both to \"8 AM\"), but they differ on Nestor and Lotus Eaters (Linati says \"9-10\" while Gilbert says \"10\"[-11]), and on Proteus and Hades (Linati 10-11 and Gilbert 11[-12]). The two documents agree on the six chapters from Aeolus to Cyclops, assigning each to a successive hour (12-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6), and on Nausicaa (8-9) and Oxen of the Sun (10-11). Disagreements enter again, however, with the final four chapters: the first schema has Circe, Eumaeus, and Ithaca occupying the hours immediately after Oxen (11-12, 12-1, 1-2), while the revised one postpones each by an hour (12 AM, 1 AM, 2 AM). The Linati schema lists an infinity symbol for Penelope, while the Gilbert simply records a dash.\n The new schema was somewhat tidier, and since Joyce composed it after finishing all eighteen chapters and making revisions to earlier chapters, it may better reflect his knowledge of his own book, at least in some instances. But the tidiness comes at the expense of capaciousness. To take one of many examples, the Linati schema identifies the Significance of Aeolusas \"The Mockery of Victory,\" and the Symbols as \"Machines: Wind: Fame: Kite: Failed Destinies: Press: mutability.\" The Larbaud schema simply identifies a single, not very evocative Symbol: \"Editor.\"\n Joyce came to regret his decision to go public, and quite possibly rued having composed the schemas in the first place. Based on a conversation in 1937, in which Joyce told him that the collaboration with Gilbert was \"A terrible mistake, an advertisement for the book. I regret it very much,\" the novelist Vladimir Nabokov decided that the whole symbolic superstructure was a kind of perverse game, not to be taken seriously. In his Lectures on Literature (delivered over the course of two decades at Wellesley and Cornell), Nabokov acknowledges \"That there is a very vague and very general Homeric echo of the theme of wanderings in Bloom’s case,\" but he argues that searching for detailed correspondences would reduce the novel to \"a pedant’s stale allegory.\" Similarly, Ezra Pound reckoned that Joyce's rickety structures were a kind of scaffolding that had helped him to conceptualize his project as he worked but could be discarded upon completion. He called the schemas an affaire de cuisine, more interesting to the chef in the kitchen than to the diner consuming the meal. \n Although skepticism is well warranted, this website mentions the schemas in the headnotes to each chapter, and occasionally in other notes when they promise to enrich the reading of a passage."

    "note": " In Nausicaa Bloom thinks of the charitable visit he paid to Mrs. Dignam an hour earlier and his plans to help her family: \"Anyhow she wants the money. Must call to those Scottish Widows as I promised. Strange name. Takes it for granted we’re going to pop off first.\" The \"strange name\" of this life insurance company (it is no less strange that Bloom refers to it in the plural, as if the company is run by widows) stems from its origins as a privately held annuity fund in 18th century Scotland. By 1904 those origins had been submerged in the flood of impersonal British financial instruments. Patrick Dignam's policy likewise seems to have been swept up in some obscure financial dealings.",
    "expandedNote": "In Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind (Vintage, 2011), Yuval Harari narrates the story of the company's founding: \"In 1744, two Presbyterian clergymen in Scotland, Alexander Webster and Robert Wallace, decided to set up a life-insurance fund that would provide pensions for the widows and orphans of dead clergymen. They proposed that each of their church's ministers would pay a small portion of his income into the fund, which would invest the money. If a minister died, his widow would receive dividends on the fund's profits. This would allow her to live comfortably for the rest of her life. But to determine how much the ministers had to pay in so that the fund would have enough money to live up to its obligations Webster and Wallace had to be able to predict how many ministers would die each year, how many widows and orphans they would leave behind, and by how many years the widows would outlive their husbands\" (285).\n Being Scots of that country's remarkable Enlightenment era (memorably explored in Arthur Herman's How the Scots Invented the Modern World), Webster and Wallace did not seek answers to these questions in divine revelation. Instead they used \"several recent breakthroughs in the fields of statistics and probability,\" including Jacob Bernoulli's Law of Large Numbers (which holds that, when very large numbers are involved, it is possible to precisely predict average outcomes), and also actuarial tables compiled fifty years earlier by Edmond Halley from the records of the German city of Breslau (286). Working with these tools, they calculated what the premiums would need to be, and predicted that in two decades, \"by the year 1765 the Fund for a Provision for the Widows and Children of the Ministers of the Church of Scotland would have capital totalling £58,348. Their calculations proved amazingly accurate. When that year arrived, the fund's capital stood at £58,347\" (287). \n In 1815, responding to the great number of families impoverished by men's deaths in the Napoleonic wars, this purely local enterprise became a publicly traded corporation on the Edinburgh stock exchange, providing financial services to anyone in the UK. The company grew throughout the 19th century, and at the time represented in the novel it had an office on Westmoreland Street in Dublin. Today Scottish Widows, as it is called, is a subsidiary of the Lloyds Banking Group with holdings in the range of $100 billion. It is still headquartered in Edinburgh, but it operates internationally and cover more than male heads of households.\n In Ulysses, though, this financial services company fulfills exactly the role for which it was created in 1744: saving widows and orphans from the disastrous loss of the family wage-earner. Mrs. Dignam dramatically acts the part in Circe: \"She holds a Scottish widow’s insurance policy and a large marquee umbrella under which her brood run with her, Patsy hopping on one shod foot, his collar loose, a hank of porksteaks dangling, Freddy whimpering, Susy with a crying cod’s mouth, Alice struggling with the baby.\" In HadesNed Lambert reports that Martin Cunningham has been taking up a collection for the family, \"Just to keep them going till the insurance is cleared up.\" The task of delivering these two pieces of news has brought Bloom to Newbridge Avenue, Sandymount in the early evening hours before the beginning of Nausicaa.\n What exactly needs to be \"cleared up\" regarding the insurance policy? This information is supplied in Cyclops. In the bar Bloom tells Joe Hynes that he is looking for Martin Cunningham to discuss \"this insurance of poor Dignam's. Martin asked me to go to the house. You see, he, Dignam, I mean, didn't serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can't recover on the policy.\" \"Holy Wars,\" says Joe, \"that's a good one if old Shylock is landed. So the wife comes out top dog, what?\" In response to this puzzling exchange, Gifford observes that \"Technically under British law, when an individual borrowed money, mortgaging his insurance policy as security, the mortgage was not valid unless the insurance company that issued the policy had been notified. This legal loophole was the source of considerable litigation, but attempts to void a mortgage based on the fact that the insuring company had not been notified of the mortgaging of its policy were rarely successful in the courts.\" \n This would explain Hynes' reaction: Mrs. Dignam, he supposes, may be able to avoid repaying the Jewish man who loaned her husband money because Dignam failed to tell the insurance company that he had used its policy as collateral. It does not address the question of what may happen to Mrs. Dignam if the courts find for the moneylender, as Gifford notes usually happened. In that case, presumably the \"Shylock\" would sue to recover his funds from the Dublin widow, or, failing that (since it seems likely that Paddy's drinking will have left little behind), from the Scottish Widows whose policy backed the loan. \n This prospect would most certainly leave something to be \"cleared up\" about the policy. The insurance company would hesitate to pay out benefits to the Dignam family until its legal liabilty was known, and if it found that it would be on the hook for repayment then it would want to reduce or eliminate the Dignams' benefits. Paddy's unscrupulous listing of his policy as collateral, then, appears to be threatening the financial wellbeing of those he left behind. \n Bloom apparently has promised to be the one to contact the company about this matter because he too holds one of their policies and is familiar with the firm. Ithaca reveals that he has taken out life insurance with the Scottish Widows at an impressive level. His desk drawer holds \"an endowment assurance policy of £ 500 in the Scottish Widows’ Assurance Society, intestated Millicent (Milly) Bloom, coming into force at 25 years as with profit policy of £ 430, £ 462-10-0 and £ 500 at 60 years or death, 65 years or death and death, respectively, or with profit policy (paidup) of £ 299-10-0 together with cash payment of £ 133-10-0, at option.\" Bloom's purchase of a substantial annuity, banking over the long term on his daughter's financial security, is not the least instance of his fiscal prudence, consistent with the habits of Jews and Scottish Protestants far more than with those of Irish Catholics."

    "note": " The entwining of Shakespearean and Homeric parallels begun in Telemachus continues in Proteus, as Stephen turns from The Tempest's mystical consolation for a death by drowning (\"Full fathom five thy father lies . . . A seachange this\") to The Odyssey's benign prophecy that its hero will die at sea (\"Seadeath, mildest of all deaths known to man\"). Stephen associates this mysteriously beautiful death with \"Old Father Ocean,\" Proteus.",
    "expandedNote": " In Book 11 of The Odyssey Tiresias prophesies \"a seaborne death, soft as this hand of mist\" for Odysseus (11.134-35, Fitzgerald 201). Stephen is terrified of water, but having just thought of the drowned man undergoing a sequence of benign metamorphoses (\"God becomes man becomes fish becomes barnacle goose becomes featherbed mountain\"), he entertains Tiresias' words calmly. \n \"Old Father Ocean\" is one possible translation of Homer's epithet halios gerôn, sometimes rendered as the Old Man of the Sea or the Ancient of the Sea. Although Joyce's schemas encourage readers to associate the third episode of Ulysses with this ancient god, only here, at the end of the episode, does the text directly refer to him."

    "note": " The strains of the British patriotic anthem Rule, Britannia! sound in various parts of Ulysses. As Haines stands gazing over the bay with eyes as \"pale as the sea,\" Stephen thinks of him as \"The seas' ruler.\" The phrase comes back into his mind in Nestor, and more exact echoes of \"rule the waves\" occur in Eumaeus and Cyclops. The Citizen also alludes contemptuously to the rhyming phrase: \"That's your glorious British navy, says the citizen, that bosses the earth. The fellows that never will be slaves, with the only hereditary chamber on the face of God's earth and their land in the hands of a dozen gamehogs and cottonball barons. That's the great empire they boast about of drudges and whipped serfs.\"",
    "expandedNote": " The foundation of British imperial power was laid with the modernizing and professional organizing of the Royal Navy under Samuel Pepys beginning in the 1660s. The British lost a naval war with the Dutch in 1667, but the changes that were underway ensured that they would suffer no more such defeats. In 1740, the progress was reflected in a stirring air by Thomas Arne, Rule, Britannia!, with lyrics by the Scottish poet James Thomson. Thomson sought to promote the newly “British” sense of identity brought into being by the Act of Union between England and Scotland in 1707. His lyrics jingoistically justify Britain’s power as divinely ordained, and proclaim that “Britons never, never, never will be slaves.” (They do not mention whether Britons may make slaves of other nations, and the Citizen notes the further irony that the English aristocracy have managed to subjugate their own people.)\n The naval power proclaimed in this 18th century song was solidified in the first years of the 19th century. Having lived with fear of French or Spanish invasion for more than a decade, the British saw the threat vanish with the decisive victory of their fleet (27 ships of the line commanded by Admiral Nelson) over the combined fleets of France and Spain (33 ships of the line under Admiral Villeneuve) at Trafalgar. Not a single British ship was lost in this engagement, which cemented the United Kingdom as the world’s premier naval power and ensured its unimpeded imperial ambitions in the 19th century. \n For many years Rule, Brittania! has been performed on the last night of The Proms, the eight weeks of daily orchestral concerts held every summer in London, in the Royal Albert Hall. An entertaining example, sung with arch pomp and circumstance by Sarah Connolly in 2009, is posted here."

  "040069seasidegirls": {
    "note": " Glancing quickly at the letter from his daughter, Bloom takes in the phrase \"Blazes Boylan's seaside girls.\" When he reads the letter later in Calypso, he sees that Milly has actually written \"Boylan's (I was on the pop of writing Blazes Boylan's) song about those seaside girls.\" But as far as anyone knows no Boylan, Blazes or otherwise, had any responsibility for the popular song Those Lovely Seaside Girls. It was written by Harry B. Norris in 1899 and sung by the cross-dressing performer Vesta Tilley on English music-hall stages. Like the passionate Là ci darem la mano and the sentimental Love's Old Sweet Song, this humorous love song enters the textures of Bloom's consciousness in various ways and reappears often in the novel, shaping readers' impressions of his erotic imagination.",
    "expandedNote": " Until its surprise ending the song presents girls at the seashore as objects of rapturous male desire. Dressed in \"bloomers,\" which gave women more freedom of movement but gave men the impression that they were seeing their underwear; \"cycling\" down the promenade, which afforded still more openings to the male gaze; and displaying \"the latest thing in socks,\" the decorative side-panel \"clocks\" that drew attention to barely clad female ankles, these young women make men's heads \"whirl\":\n Down at Margate looking very charming you are sure to meet\n Those girls, dear girls, those lovely seaside girls.\n With sticks they steer and promenade the pier to give the boys a treat;\n In piqué silks and lace, they tip you quite a playful wink.\n It always is the case: you seldom stop to think.\n You fall in love of course upon the spot,\n But not with one girl—always with the lot . . . \n (Chorus)\n Those girls, those girls, those lovely seaside girls,\n All dimples, smiles, and curls—your head it simply whirls!\n They look all right, complexions pink and white;\n They've diamond rings and dainty feet,\n Golden hair from Regent Street,\n Lace and grace and lots of face—those pretty little seaside girls.\nThere's Maud and Clara, Gwendoline and Sarah—where do they come from?\n Those girls, dear girls, those lovely seaside girls.\n In bloomers smart they captivate the heart when cycling down the prom;\n At wheels and heels and hose you must not look, 'tis understood,\n But every Johnnie knows: it does the eyesight good.\n The boys observe the latest thing in socks;\n They learn the time—by looking at the clocks . . . \n (Chorus)\n When you go to do a little boating, just for fun you take\n Those girls, dear girls, those lovely seaside girls.\n They all say, \"We so dearly love the sea!\" Their way on board they make;\n The wind begins to blow: each girl remarks, \"How rough today!\"\n \"It's lovely, don't you know!\"—and then they sneak away.\n And as the yacht keeps rolling with the tide,\n You'll notice, hanging o'er the vessel's side . . . \n (Modified Chorus)\n Those girls, those girls, those lovely seaside girls,\n All dimples, smiles, and curls—your head it simply whirls!\n They look a sight, complexions green and white;\n Their hats fly off, and at your feet\n Falls golden hair from Regent Street,\n Rouge and puffs slip down the cuffs—of pretty little seaside girls.\n The letter's mention of the song, which Bloom clearly knows well, makes him think of how his lovely girl's stomach did not whirl when he took her out \"round the Kish\" on the Erin's King: \"Damned old tub pitching about. Not a bit funky. Her pale blue scarf loose in the wind with her hair.\" But, as his recollection of her flowing clothes and hair makes clear, the song also evokes Milly's sexual attractiveness. The letter says that her \"young student,\" Alec Bannon, sings the song, and there can be little doubt who he is thinking of when he sings it. Indeed, as his \"photo girl\" Milly would be iconographically associated with both the seashore and sexual attractiveness. \n Milly's erroneous attribution of the song to \"Boylan\" inevitably introduces into Bloom's picture of seaside girls another, still more uncomfortable complex of sexual associations. As lines from the song play in his head, he experiences apprehension about the imminent sexual arousal not only of his daughter but also of his wife: \"Milly too. Young kisses: the first. Far away now past. Mrs Marion. Reading, lying back now, counting the strands of her hair, smiling, braiding. . . . Girl's sweet light lips. Will happen too. He felt the flowing qualm spread over him. Useless to move now. Lips kissed, kissing, kissed. Full gluey woman's lips.\" The song has the effect of fusing Milly and Molly in Bloom's imagination, in keeping with its observation that erotic infatuation leads you to fall in love \"not with one girl—always with the lot.\"\n This principle is extended in later chapters of the novel when Bloom experiences the charms of other seaside girls, like Miss Douce in Sirens: \"Her ear too is a shell, the peeping lobe there. Been to the seaside. Lovely seaside girls. Skin tanned raw. . . . Your head it simply. Hair braided over: shell with seaweed. Why do they hide their ears with seaweed hair? . . . Find the way in. A cave. No admittance except on business.\" The teasing promise of sexual access that Bloom sees in Miss Douce is repeated by Gerty MacDowell in Nausicaa: \"Didn't look back when she was going down the strand. Wouldn't give that satisfaction. Those girls, those girls, those lovely seaside girls. . . . Did she know what I? Course. Like a cat sitting beyond a dog's jump.\" A page later, Bloom thinks of the effect that the erotic display had on him: \"Lord! It was all things combined. Excitement. When she leaned back, felt an ache at the butt of my tongue. Your head it simply swirls.\" \n Sexual excitement is \"all things combined,\" and it exceeds the limits of relationship to a person. Objects of attraction flow together in the erotic imagination. That is the underlying reason, perhaps, that the archetypal seaside girls of Greek mythology, the Sirens, are a collective embodiment of alluring feminity rather than named individuals. And individuality is extinguished in death as well as erotic excitement. In Hades the seaside girls make a macabre appearance as Bloom thinks about the dead bodies in their graves: \"But they must breed a devil of a lot of maggots. Soil must be simply swirling with them. Your head it simply swurls. Those pretty little seaside gurls.\"\n Norris set his song at \"Margate,\" a beach town in Kent in the southeast of England. Like dozens of such Victorian destination resorts, Margate offered holiday vacationers more than just swimming. Beaches were often backed by long, wide promenades so that well-dressed visitors could stroll along the coast. Substantial piers extended far out into the ocean, so that people could walk above the water as well as along it, protected by iron railings and illuminated at night by iron lampposts. The piers and the elaborate pavilions that were often built on top of them offered hot and cold seawater baths, food and drinks, penny arcades, band and orchestral concerts, dancing, theatrical productions, comedians, giftshops. \n In Lestrygonians Bloom thinks that Molly could perform on some of these piers: \"What about English wateringplaces? Brighton, Margate. Piers by moonlight. Her voice floating out. Those lovely seaside girls.\" He thinks of the piers also in Calypso: \"Swurls, he says. Pier with lamps, summer evening, band.\" Molly herself has some more frankly carnal thoughts about Margate, based on its scandalous bathing practices."

    "expandedNote": " The next sentence reveals that Stephen is recalling the words of a sadistic priest from A Portrait of the Artist. In that passage Father Dolan does repeat (with variation) the phrase \"lazy idle loafer,\" \"lazy idle little schemer\" again and again across several pages of text. But he says \"I see schemer in your face\" only once. Ulysses reshapes that statement into anaphora.\n In Circe Zoe repeats the phrase: \"I see it in your face.\" In response, Lynch slaps Kitty on the bottom twice and mentions the instrument with which Father Dolan tortured the young Stephen: \"Like that. Pandybat.\" The crack of a pandybat sounds through the air, twice, \"the coffin of the pianola flies open, the bald little round jack-in-the-box head of Father Dolan springs up,\" and Father Dolan reprises his act from A Portrait: \"Any boy want flogging? Broke his glasses? Lazy idle little schemer. See it in your eye.\""

  "040017seemtolikeit": {
    "note": " In addition to its anality, another peculiar feature of Bloom's sexuality is a tendency to masochistic self-abasement. These fantasies will not become fully manifest until they are enacted in Circe, most decisively in actions inspired by the writer who lent his name to the phenomenon, Leopold von Sacher Masoch. But their presence is announced early in Calypso when Bloom thinks about his cat, \"Cruel. Her nature. Curious mice never squeal. Seem to like it.\"",
    "expandedNote": " It can hardly be an accident of Joyce's writing that the cat is female and that her vocalizations (\"Mkgnao!,\" \"Mrkgnao!,\" \"Mrkrgnao!\") resemble those of the half-conscious Mrs. Bloom (\"Mn.\"). Bloom's reflection on his cat's cruelty, and his uncharacteristically unrealistic thought that her victims too may be deriving pleasure from her claws, suggest that he is constructing Molly in fantasy (though perhaps unconsciously) as a dominatrix and himself as a passive but willing sub. Many details of the novel support this impression, leading up to the extravagant hallucinatory events in Circe. \n As Calypso continues, more of Bloom's thoughts and actions suggest that he does derive a certain pleasure from submission. As he waits in the butchershop, eyeing the servant girl in front of him, he remembers in strongly suggestive terms the way he has seen her beat a rug in the garden: \"Strong pair of arms. Whacking a carpet on the clothesline. She does whack it, by George. The way her crooked skirt swings at each whack.\" Two paragraphs later, the pleasure he takes in watching her vigorous beating is juxtaposed against his passive sense of subjection: \"He held the page aslant patiently, bending his senses and his will, his soft subject gaze at rest. The crooked skirt swinging, whack by whack by whack.\" Several paragraphs later still, his voyeuristic leering in the butchershop, and the girl's disinterest, give him further occasion to become aroused by abasement: \"they never understand. . . . The sting of disregard glowed to weak pleasure within his breast.\" \n Bloom's tendency to become a servant in his wife's presence—bustling about to anticipate her desires and execute her bossy orders, identifying with Mozart's Leporello—is another aspect of this submissiveness. So too is the helplessness that he feels with respect to her adultery. In the face of both Molly's infidelity and Milly's sexual maturation, he experiences physical sensations that sound sickly but also vaguely erotic: \"A soft qualm, regret, flowed down his backbone, increasing. Will happen, yes. Prevent. Useless: can't move. Girl's sweet light lips. Will happen too. He felt the flowing qualm spread over him. Useless to move now. Lips kissed, kissing, kissed. Full gluey woman's lips.\"\n The letter in Lotus Eaters shows that Martha Clifford is well aware of Bloom's submissive tendencies, and willing to play along: \"I do wish I could punish you for that. . . . Please write me a long letter and tell me more. Remember if you do not I will punish you. So now you know what I will do to you, you naughty boy, if you do not write.\" When Bloom writes back to Martha in Sirens, he thinks again about the servant girl beating the carpet: \"How will you pun? You punish me? Crooked skirt swinging, whack by. Tell me I want to. Know.\""

In Circe he weaves the memory into his prophetic dream of Haroun al Raschid: \"It was here. Street of harlots. In Serpentine avenue Beelzebub showed me her, a fubsy widow. Where's the red carpet spread?\" Stephen (or whatever hallucinatory version of his consciousness the episode is presenting us with) seems to be expecting to meet his widow in the red-light district, fulfilling the promise of the man in the dream (recalled in Proteus) to introduce him to someone important: \"In.

His letter to the editor reflects awareness of new, cutting-edge science in bacteriology, virology, and veterinary medicine. But he is wrong to say that FMD \"can be cured. It is cured. My cousin, Blackwood Price, writes to me it is regularly treated and cured in Austria by cattledoctors there.\" No cure or successful vaccination was even in the offing; Deasy's barrage of learned names does not represent actionable information.",
    "expandedNote": " The details from the letter display a combination of enlightened scientific awareness and incomplete understanding. Gifford notes that \"Veterinary surgeons\" were a \"relatively new branch of medical science at the turn of the century,\" and he commends Deasy for his argument \"that epidemic diseases among animals should be investigated and treated in the light of the latest scientific methods.\" But his inquiries with the national records bureau in Austria turned up no evidence that the \"Emperor's horses at Murzsteg\" were subject to veterinary experiments at any time during the years 1895-1914. \n \"Rinderpest\" was another bovine disease, and the \"Percentage of salted horses\" refers to attempts to inoculate horses against tuberculosis, with a biological substance suspended in saline solution (hence \"salted\"). But the tuberculosis treatment did not live up to initial hopes, and rinderpest remained incurable. \"Serum and virus\" apparently refers to methods developed in the 1890s for preventing and/or treating infectious diseases like tetanus by injecting patients with blood serum from immunized horses. These antibody and antitoxin treatments were eventually extended into the realm of viral illness (FMD is caused by a virus), but not until the 1940s. \"Koch's preparation\" was devised in 1882 by Robert Koch as an inoculation against anthrax; but when two of the great scientist's students attempted to apply the same technique to the prevention of FMD, early in the 20th century, they achieved only minimal success. \n This jumble of information about FMD, TB, rinderpest, cows, horses, and Austrian doctors gets jumbled some more in Oxen of the Sun, when a drunken Stephen tells Bloom that \"he had dispatches from the emperor's chief tailtickler thanking him for the hospitality, that was sending over Doctor Rinderpest, the bestquoted cowcatcher in all Muscovy, with a bolus or two of physic to take the bull by the horns.\" \"Muscovy\" may be a derivative of \"Murzsteg,\" translated by bad memory and alcoholic and linguistic exuberance."

In Hades, Bloom watches as \"A server bearing a brass bucket\" precedes the priest into the mortuary chapel, and then listens as the boy sings the Latin lines that the liturgy prescribes as responses to the priest's: \"The server piped the answers in the treble.\" Stephen has performed this role in his youth, and in Telemachus,taunted by Mulligan's adoption of the role of a priestly celebrant, he feels himself back in that subordinate position.",
    "expandedNote": " When Mulligan leaves his shaving bowl (which has served as a ciborium) behind on the top of the tower, Stephen decides to bring it back down and return it to him: \"He went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness, smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck. So I carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes. I am another now and yet the same. A servant too. A server of a servant.\" Since even the celebrant performs his actions in the service of God, servers may be conceived as doubly indentured, servers of a servant. Thornton observes that a kind of biblical curse may be involved. Ham saw his father Noah's nakedness and all his descendants were cast out: \"Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.\"\n At the conclusion of his pious phase in A Portrait, when the director of Belvedere College asks him whether he feels he has a vocation for the priesthood, Stephen recalls his many fantasies of performing priestly rituals, but \"above all it had pleased him to fill the second place in those dim scenes of his imagining. He shrank from the dignity of celebrant because it displeased him to imagine that all the vague pomp should end in his own person or that ritual should assign to him so clear and final an office. He longed for the minor sacred offices, to be vested with the tunicle of subdeacon at high mass, to stand aloof from the altar, forgotten by the people . . .\"\n Now, holding the shaving bowl that Mulligan made a chalice, and remembering being an altar boy at Clongowes Wood College, he reflects that his desire for self-effacement seems to have implicated him in another variety of servitude. Just as he once served priests who served God, now he serves Mulligan who serves the British overlord Haines. Though unshackled from the Catholic Church, he is still unfree."

Byrne lived at 7 Eccles Street. In 1904 the house was unoccupied, allowing Joyce's fictional protagonist to move in.\n In Wandering Rocks an unnamed woman, having opened a window sash to fling a coin to a beggar and inadvertently dislodged a card that was displayed on the sash, puts the card back in its place: \"A card Unfurnished Apartments reappeared on the windowsash of number 7 Eccles street.\" 7 Eccles was one of a row of three-story brick houses on the north side of the street.

It is first described mathematically, in the manner of a man counting the doorways on his side of the block: \"At the housesteps of the 4th of the equidifferent uneven numbers, number 7 Eccles street, he inserted his hand mechanically into the back pocket of his trousers to obtain his latchkey.\" (The key is still not there.) \n The address is also mentioned by comparison to a grander abode: \"Could Bloom of 7 Eccles street foresee Bloom of Flowerville?\" And it is mentioned by comparison to having no abode at all: \"5 pounds reward, lost, stolen or strayed from his residence 7 Eccles street, missing gent about 40, answering to the name of Bloom, Leopold (Poldy), height 5 ft 9 1/2 inches, full build, olive complexion, may have since grown a beard.\"\n The house at 7 Eccles Street, alas for Joyce pilgrims around the world, was demolished in 1967. But John Ryan, the Dublin artist and man of letters who organized the first Bloomsday in 1954, rescued the front door and its surrounding masonry and installed it in The Bailey pub which he had purchased in 1957 and made a hangout for writers. In 1995 the doorway was moved to the James Joyce Centre, a museum in an elegant Georgian house at 35 North Great George's Street. \n Very recently the door was reunited with its knocker, which a New Yorker named Fredric Seiden, visiting Dublin and making a pilgrimage to 7 Eccles, removed when he realized that the house was soon to be torn down. The James Joyce Centre flew Seiden from New York to Dublin in June 2013 to return the loud proud knocker to its place of honor."

    "note": " In 1904 Dublin had covered sewers (an improvement over the open drains and backyard cesspools of the 18th century), but no sewage treatment facilities. The River Liffey served as the ultimate sewer, carrying vast amounts of untreated human waste into Dublin Bay. The novel casts many glances at this urban pollution problem, and one glance at a major effort that was being made to improve the infrastructure. Wandering Rocks makes an anti-imperial gesture out of the filth.",
    "expandedNote": " In Proteus Stephen notices places on the bayshore where the downstream effects are evident: \"Unwholesome sandflats waited to suck his treading soles, breathing upward sewage breath. He coasted them, walking warily.\" Gifford notes that \"the inshore waters of Dublin Bay, particularly just south of the mouth of the Liffey, where Stephen is walking, were notoriously polluted\" (51-52). \n Shellfish were affected by the bacteria-infested waters, causing periodic outbreaks of disease. Near the end of Nausicaa Bloom, who is sitting near where Stephen was walking, reflects, \"Better not stick here all night like a limpet,\" and soon afterward he is thinking of the human beings who eat such mollusks: \"Poor man O'Connor wife and five children poisoned by mussels here. The sewage. Hopeless.\" He has similar thoughts about oysters in Lestrygonians: \"Unsightly like a clot of phlegm. Filthy shells. Devil to open them too. Who found them out? Garbage, sewage they feed on.\" He goes on to think about the months-with-an-R rule: \"June has no ar no oysters.\" In the same episode, he entertains the thought of swimming in the Liffey: \"If I threw myself down? Reuben J's son must have swallowed a good bellyful of that sewage.\"\n One of the Liffey's tributaries, Poddle River, makes an appearance as a bearer of sewage in Wandering Rocks. By the time represented in the novel it had been confined to a brick tunnel and covered over with city pavements, and it emptied into the Liffey through a culvert. As the viceregal cavalcade passes by this culvert, the sewage-choked stream offers open-mouthed, scathing homage: \"From its sluice in Wood quay wall under Tom Devan's office Poddle river hung out in fealty a tongue of liquid sewage.\" Gifford notes that Joyce took fictional license to move this culvert to the Wood Quay wall from its actual location in the Wellington Quay wall, about 350 yards east. \n The Dublin Main Drainage Scheme, discussed for decades in the late 19th century before work finally began, devised a way of cleaning up the Liffey. New sewer lines were built under the quays on both banks of the river, intercepting the outflow before it reached the Liffey and carrying it east to a wastewater treatment plant in Ringsend. There, the solids were settled out for disposal in the Irish Sea, and the liquids released into the harbor near the Pigeon House for the tides to disperse. The project was completed in 1906; in 1904 it was still an ongoing dream of civic improvement. As Hugh Kenner notes in his foreword to Joseph O'Brien's Dear, Dirty Dublin (1982), this was \"long after such a procedure had been instituted in London, but turn-of-the-century Dublin was a retarded city indeed\" (viii). For more on the scheme, see the Greater Dublin Drainage website at www.greaterdublindrainage.com.\n The novel comically alludes to this construction project in Lestrygonians, when Tom Rochford, who is working on it, comes into Davy Byrne's pub. \"—How is the main drainage? Nosey Flynn asked, sipping. / For answer Tom Rochford pressed his hand to his breastbone and hiccupped. / —Would I trouble you for a glass of fresh water, Mr Byrne? he said.\" The water is for dissolving some \"powder from a twisted paper\" to treat a problem in Rochford's main drainage: \"—That cursed dyspepsia, he said before drinking.\""

  "070018shamsquire": {
    "note": " In Aeolus Professor MacHugh mocks Myles Crawford, the editor of the Evening Telegraph: \"And here comes the sham squire himself!\" The reference is to a highly disreputable former owner of the Freeman's Journal, Francis Higgins (1745-1802), who steered that paper away from its nationalist mission toward accommodation of the British government. Higgins also acted as an informer for Dublin Castle at the time of the 1798 United Irishmen rebellion, betraying \"lord Edward Fitzgerald\" to the authorities. He probably began informing on nationalist patriots years earlier. Crawford responds to the mocking salutation with gruff familiarity of his own: \"Getonouthat, you bloody old pedagogue!\"",
    "expandedNote": " The nickname arose from Higgins' fraudulent rise in 18th century Irish society. Son of an impoverished attorney's clerk, he started out in that occupation himself. But in 1766 he married the daughter of a wealthy Catholic merchant after converting to Protestantism and producing a forged document that showed him to be a landed country gentleman. In January 1767 he assaulted his mother-in-law, and the judge at the trial called him a \"sham squire.\" After serving time in prison for that attack and for another assault on a grocer, Higgins practiced various kinds of business and gained more wealth. He owned pubs that housed gambling operations, was elected master of the hosiers' guild, became an attorney, was made deputy coroner of Dublin and later under-sheriff, and in 1783 bought the Freeman's Journal. He ensured that he made money from the Journal, as it was called in those days (see the \"Infernal Journal\" in the cartoon accompanying this note): in 1788 alone the British government paid him £1,600 for publishing official proclamations. \n Having been devoted to the cause of Irish nationhood since its founding in 1763, the paper now became a vehicle for attacking nationalist patriots like Henry Grattan. Higgins also assisted the government cause in more direct and lucrative ways. Among other acts of domestic espionage, he claimed a reward of £1,000 for revealing the whereabouts of Lord Edward Fitzgerald, president of the military arm of the United Irishmen, in May 1798. In Wandering Rocks Tom Kernan recalls this action when he walks near the house where Fitzgerald hid: \"That ruffian, that sham squire with his violet gloves gave him away. Course they were on the wrong side.\" Even though he is a unionist, Kernan thinks of Higgins' action as a despicable betrayal. \n In 1866 an Irish historian named William John Fitzpatrick published a book titled The Sham Squire and the Informers of 1798, detailing the extent of Higgins' perfidy. The first edition sold more than 16,000 copies, and photographic facsimiles are sold even today. Fitzpatrick's chronicle does not mention any \"violet gloves.\" Wherever Tom Kernan may have encountered this detail, his memory of the fact does seem consistent with his own pride in flashy clothes."

    "note": " \"Silk of the kine and poor old woman,\" two phrases that Stephen attaches to the old milkwoman in Telemachus, are both names given to Ireland \"in old times,\" so he is thinking of her as a mythical representative of the nation. The female figure evoked by the second phrase continues to occupy his imagination later in the chapter and later in the day.",
    "expandedNote": " Gifford notes that the first phrase, from the Irish a shíoda na mbó, means “the most beautiful of cattle.” The t-Sean Bhean Bhocht or Shan Van Vocht, a legendary figure from a 1790s ballad, looks like a poor old woman to most, but to true patriots appears as a beautiful young queen. In this instance it seems that no true patriots are present, for we see only the “lowly form of an immortal serving her conqueror [Haines]and her gay betrayer [Mulligan].” And when Haines tries speaking some Irish to her, she mistakes it for French. \n The Shan Van Vocht had been particularly on people's minds since 1895, when two young Ulster women, Alice Milligan and Anna Johnston, founded a monthly journal with that title. The journal was published in Belfast from January 1896 to April 1899. It aimed to promote the centenary celebration of the 1798 Rising and to advance the nationalist cause of decolonizing Ireland. It also published items of poetry, fiction, history, folklore, and other cultural content consistent with the aims of the Irish Revival, some of it in Irish. Alice Milligan in particular was a poet of some repute and a well-known figure in Dublin. The magazine was distributed throughout Ireland. For more on the political importance of this journal, see Nora Shovelin's unpublished masters thesis, Political Communication in the Shan Van Vocht Magazine, 1896-1899: An Example of Print Culture, A Media-Product with Action-Value (2005). \n Stephen does not have a good relationship with the Poor Old Woman. Here he looks at the milkwoman as a kind of goddess who may have a message for him, \"but scorned to beg her favour.\" Soon he is resenting her attention to Mulligan and Haines, and later in Telemachus he appears to think of Ireland as \"A crazy queen, old and jealous,\" who \"wants me for odd jobs.\" \n In Circe the figure comes back as Old Gummy Granny, a fiercely nationalistic crone who urges Stephen to fight and die for his country. When he calls her \"The old sow that eats her farrow,\" resuscitating a phrase that he had coined for Ireland in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, she responds with her own livestock image: \"Ochone! Ochone! Silk of the kine! (She wails.) You met with poor old Ireland and how does she stand?\""

  "040096sheknew": {
    "note": " When Bloom recalls the death of his infant son in Calypso,he twice thinks that the experienced midwife (\"Lots of babies she must have helped into the world\") could tell at once that the infant would not survive: \"She knew from the first poor little Rudy wouldn't live. Well, God is good, sir. She knew at once.\" How, one wonders, could she have known that? And can readers share in her omniscience by learning what killed Rudy? Two chapters later, the novel offers a clue to the first question: Rudy's skin looked purple. With no diagnostic testing or autopsy having been performed, the second question cannot be answered definitively. But the addition of another clue—in Ithaca, we learn that Rudy died eleven days after birth—suggests that he may have died of a congenital cardiac defect known as Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS).",
    "expandedNote": " HLHS is characterized by a severely underdeveloped left ventricle and ascending aorta, and by the presence of a septal defect allowing blood to flow between the two atrial chambers. In a normal heart, blood that has flowed from the right ventricle to the lungs to take in oxygen returns to the left atrium and moves from there to the left ventricle, which pumps it through the aorta to the rest of the body. In the abnormal development of HLHS the left ventricle is too small to pump oxygenated blood to the body (in the worst cases, only a slit), and the ascending aorta is likewise diminutive (in the worst cases, only a thread). \n With its normal passage blocked, the oxygenated blood in the left atrium passes through the atrial septal defect always found in cases of HLHS into the right atrium and thence into the right ventricle, where it mixes with the oxygen-poor blood that the veins have brought back to the heart from the body. The pulmonary artery carries some of this mixed blood (shown as purple in the illustrations) to the lungs, but some of it passes to the rest of the body via the ductus arteriosus, a fetal blood vessel connecting the pulmonary artery and the aorta that, in utero, lets most of the blood bypass the fluid-filled, not-yet-functioning lungs of the fetus. In healthy babies the ductus arteriosus closes shortly after birth. \n As long as the fetus with a hypoplastic left ventricle remains in the womb it is sustained by the oxygen it receives from the mother's blood. As soon as the umbilical connection is severed, however, the baby must depend solely on the poorly oxygenated blood pumped from its right ventricle. Oxygen saturation plummets to about 85%, resulting in marked cyanosis (purplish skin). The decreased oxygenation delays the closure of the ductus arteriosus, allowing adequate blood flow to the body for a short while, but eventually this vessel does close—typically in about 11 days. Blood flow is greatly reduced, and death follows quickly. Without treatment, HLHS is universally fatal. \n The precise birth and death dates detailed in Ithaca provide one indication that Rudy may have died from HLHS or some other \"ductal-dependent lesion\" revealed by the closing of the ductus: \"birth on 29 December 1893 of second (and only male) issue, deceased 9 January 1894, aged 11 days.\" Another clue comes in Hades when Bloom sees a child's tiny coffin and is reminded of his little boy's cyanotic appearance: \"A dwarf's face, mauve and wrinkled like little Rudy's was. Dwarf's body, weak as putty, in a whitelined deal box.\" Although the illustrations here exaggerate the red color of oxygenated blood, the blue color of venous blood, and the purple color of their mixing, the three kinds of blood do display these distinctive colors. The narrative itself exaggerates the cyanosis of Rudy's skin by describing it as mauve, a rich purple hue. The purple coloration must have been the trigger for Mrs. Thornton's intuitive judgment that the baby was suffering from a fatal condition.\n Today, there are three staged surgical procedures for rebuilding these infants' malformed hearts: the multifaceted Norwood procedure, generally performed in the first week of life and fatal more than 10% of the time; the Glenn procedure (Bidirectional Glenn Anastomosis), usually done at about six months of age and carrying a much lower surgical mortality risk of 1-3%; and the Fontan Procedure, performed at 18-24 months with a comparably low risk of death. The three operations are performed successively, each building on the work of the former. They are palliative, not curative, leaving the child with only a single functioning ventricle. \n Even with surgical and medical interventions, mortality and morbidity from HLHS remain high. Children with the condition typically suffer from incomplete brain development during gestation and score in the low-normal range on IQ tests; other somatic complications are commonplace. One study showed that, a year after the Norwood Procedure, the mortality rate was 25%. Over time, survival rates increase. For children who survive to the age of 12 months, long-term survival up to 18 years of age is approximately 90%. Even had the Blooms been able to take advantage of these open-heart surgeries, their lives as parents would not have been easy. But the development of the three procedures lay many decades in the future. In 1904, HLHS was a death sentence. \n Surrounded by large families, Joyce may have known of infants who died at about 11 days of age, or his brief stints as a medical student in Dublin and Paris could have familiarized him with the deadly heart condition. Although rare, HLHS is common enough to be known to all doctors: in the U.S. the prevalence is approximately 2-3 cases per 10,000 live births. HLHS accounts for 2-3% percent of all cases of congenital heart disease and afflicts males approximately 1.5 times as often as females."

    "note": " Deasy's boast that Ireland \"has the honour of being the only country which never persecuted the jews\" is absurd, considering that he himself engages in the kind of hate speech that lays the basis for persecution. It is also untrue: Jews were intermittently persecuted in Limerick in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His misstatements are crowned by the false assertion that \"she never let them in.\" But all of this falsehood is complicated by the fact that the great Daniel O'Connell made the same boast (in a very different spirit) in the mid-19th century.",
    "expandedNote": " Although Jewish history in Ireland goes back at least as far as the 11th century, the total number of Jewish residents has always been quite small, so they never presented the target for bigotry found in Germany, Russia, or France. Gifford notes that \"Jews are first mentioned as resident in Ireland in eleventh-century documents; Henry II acknowledged their presence (and legitimated it) by assigning custody of the King's Judaism in Ireland to one of his lords in 1174. From the time of the Norman Conquest the King's Judaism meant that the Jews were literally the king's chattel, but in practice they were protected, their rights to free exercise of their religion guaranteed and their businesses as merchants and moneylenders relatively secure. Jews were expelled from Ireland, as from England, in 1290 and were resettled in both countries under Cromwell in the mid-seventeenth century.\" \n At the turn of the 20th century, the small number of Irish Jews was increasing. Gifford observes that the 1904 edition ofThom's directory records 3,898 of them in 1901, as compared to 1,779 in the 1891 census. By the late 1940s, the Jewish population in the Republic was approaching 6,000, but it has since declined to nearly the 1891 level. In the 2006 census, 1,930 Jews lived in the Republic. (All of these figures of course beg the question of what defines a Jew. By the traditional definition of Jewish maternity, Leopold Bloom himself does not qualify.)\n Of the so-called Limerick pogrom, Frank McCourt writes, \"Because I grew up in Limerick, the only city in Ireland with an anti-Semitic blot on its escutcheon, I've followed the Jewish thread in Ulysses. In January 1904 a Limerick priest, John Creagh, stirred the people up against the Jews who, he said, had shed Christian blood. Richard Ellmann says, 'Eighty members of the Jewish community were driven out, and only forty were left. Then Creagh was withdrawn from the community.' (That same Creagh, obviously a madman and not the first to be tolerated by the church, was then sent to Australia where he preached against the aborigines.) If Leopold Bloom is Jewish and anti-Semitism a theme in Ulysses, why did Joyce fail to mention the Limerick incident? He must have known about it. Ellmann tells us he did, and that makes it gospel\" (Foreword to Yes I said yes I will Yes: A Celebration of James Joyce, Ulysses, and 100 Years of Bloomsday, ed. Nola Tully). \n The anti-Semitic actions in Limerick began in the 1880s and 90s, but Father Creagh took them to a new level, charging the Jews with the two things that Mr. Deasy associates them with—practicing usury and rejecting Christ—as well as consorting with Freemasons. Many of the Jews who fled Limerick went to Cork, intending to embark for America from Queenstown harbor, but they were warmly welcomed by the people of Cork and settled there."

  "080016shelbourne": {
    "note": " The \"Shelbourne hotel,\" recently restored to some of its former glory by the Marriott corporation, is a Dublin landmark on the north side of St. Stephen's Green. Bloom thinks of having gone there to buy some articles of clothing from a Mrs. Miriam Dandrade when he and Molly were desperately trying to make a living selling second-hand clothes. The experience of joining a rich lady in her hotel room to look through her underthings has made a vivid impression on Bloom.",
    "expandedNote": "Built in 1824 and named after the second Earl of Shelburne, the hotel has always catered to what its builder, the Tipperary entrepreneur Martin Burke, called \"genteel customers.\" At the turn of the last century a large proportion of these were females of advancing years. George Moore's Parnell and His Island (1887) wonderfully evokes the spectacle that would have greeted Bloom as he came to meet Mrs. Dandrade:\n The Shelbourne is a large and commodious hotel. On entering, a winter garden on the first floor strikes a pleasant note of green, and a little fountain murmurs pleasantly among grey stone frogs. The pen of Balzac would be necessary to describe the Shelbourne Hotel: it is the pension of Madame Vauquier placed in aristocratic circles. For three pounds a week you can live there; and this liberality on the part of the proprietor is singularly appreciated by widows and old maids of all sorts. The ladies' drawing-room is on the right, and Flaubert's celebrated phrase may be applied to it, \"It was the moral centre of the house.\" The walls are decorated with Swiss landscapes—mountains, chamois, cascades, and lakes. About the chimney-piece there are a great number of low chairs, chairs for invalid ladies, chairs made for novel reading and for wool-work. Nothing is spoken of but men and marriages; it is here that all the scandals of Dublin are laid and are hatched.\n § In Lestrygonians Bloom thinks of the upper-crust woman he saw leaving the Grosvenor Hotel in Lotus Eaters and is reminded of Mrs. Dandrade, a rich divorcée: \"That one at the Grosvenor this morning. Up with her on the car: wishswish. Stonewall or fivebarred gate put her mount to it. Think that pugnosed driver did it out of spite. Who is this she was like? O yes! Mrs Miriam Dandrade that sold me her old wraps and black underclothes in the Shelbourne hotel. Divorced Spanish American. Didn’t take a feather out of her my handling them. As if I was her clotheshorse. Saw her in the viceregal party when Stubbs the park ranger got me in with Whelan of the Express. Scavenging what the quality left. High tea. Mayonnaise I poured on the plums thinking it was custard. Her ears ought to have tingled for a few weeks after. Want to be a bull for her. Born courtesan. No nursery work for her, thanks.\"\n Mrs. Dandrade's status as one of \"the quality,\" and her unruffled composure while Bloom fingers her frillies, allies her closely in his sexual estimation with the woman at the Grosvenor. These \"horsey women\" of the rich Ascendancy class are far out of his league, and he would be only too happy to bring them down a notch by bedding them—\"Possess her once take the starch out of her,\" he thinks inLotus Eaters—if only he were the copulative \"bull\" that he imagines them requiring. But Bloom is no conquering hero in the piston-and-cylinder department, and so his fantasy does something unexpected. \n Rather than, or in addition to, imagining himself stripping the frillies off this haughty woman and taking her on her hotel bed, it seems that Bloom has been intrigued by the thought of being her and being so taken. In Circe Bello accuses him of adopting \"various poses of surrender\" while trying on women's clothes at the mirror, including \"That secondhand black operatop shift and short trunkleg naughties all split up the stitches at her last rape that Mrs Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne hotel.\" Bloom confesses his infatuation: \"Miriam. Black. Demimondaine.\" But Bello insists that he confront the mimetic envy buried within his desire: \"You were a nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and lay swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade about to be violated by lieutenant Smythe-Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell M. P.,\" and ten or twelve or twenty other important and unimportant males. \n The Shelbourne Hotel, then, lives in the novel as a site imbued with a middle-class man's ambivalent attitudes toward the landed gentry, as well as sexual proclivities that the reader comes to recognize as distinctively Bloomian: androgynistic curiosity about female experience, voyeuristic contemplation of the sex act, masochistic self-abnegation."

    "expandedNote": " Nestor associated shells with money because they are hollow, and an obsession with money empties life of its humanity. But the shells on the beach were once life forms. Houses on the shore are \"Human shells,\" harboring life for a time and then emptied.

Ought I go to a dentist, I wonder, with that money?\"\n As a person walks on the beach, he or she is helping to break up the skeletons of countless small creatures: \"Stephen closed his eyes to hear his boots crush crackling wrack and shells\"; \"Loose sand and shellgrit crusted her bare feet.\" The ocean is perpetually \"Driving before it a loose drift of rubble, fanshoals of fishes, silly shells,\" working to crush these husks into bits. \n Humanity is not exempt. One sentence after Stephen thinks of the surf pushing shells to shore, he imagines the drowned man's body rising to the surface and \"bobbing landward.\" His body too will be recycled: \"God becomes man becomes fish becomes barnacle goose becomes featherbed mountain.

  "040012sherbet": {
    "note": " Bloom gets much of his conception of the Middle East from romantic novels and Christmas pantomimes like Turko the Terrible, and he acknowledges that the real thing is \"Probably not a bit like it really,\" but many of the details of his reverie in Calypso would seem familiar to a native of the region. Cold nonalcoholic drinks with fruit and herbal flavors are indeed sold as \"sherbet\" in Turkey, Iran, and Arab countries, as well as some lands farther east.",
    "expandedNote": " Several different kinds of sherbet are mentioned in the Persian medical encyclopedia Zakhirah-i Khvarazm'Shahi, which dates to the 12th century. The word itself is Arabic in origin: the root sh-r-b refers to drinks, and drinks of this type are called sharba in modern Arab countries (wine is sharaab, distilled liquor mashroob). In Iran they are sharbat, and in Turkey serbet. It is not clear what tongue Joyce may be thinking of when he has Bloom mention \"their dark language,\" but Arabic, Persian, and Turkish all share this word.\n West Asian sherbets are made by dissolving a sweet condensed nectar—made variously of fruits (cherry, lemon, strawberry, pineapple), flower petals (orange, rose, hibiscus), and/or seeds (basil, chia, anise)—in several parts of chilled water. Sherbets \"scented with fennel\" seem to be unheard of, though the similar-tasting anise is sometimes an ingredient. (Like the Greek ouzo and the Swiss absinthe, Turkey also has an alcoholic anise drink called raaki.)\n In Iran sharbats are usually served elegantly in tall glasses, with long spoons for guests to stir the ingredients together, but in Turkey street sellers called serbetci dispense the liquid already mixed from brass flasks strapped to their backs. This may be the source of Bloom's fantasy of drinking sherbet while wandering the streets of a Middle Eastern city.\n (Thanks to Dr. Iman Fani for a personal communication of some of the information in this note.)"

  "160007shipofthestreet": {
    "note": " Near the end of Eumaeus Stephen and Bloom come upon \"a horse, dragging a sweeper.\" Many European cities at the turn of the last century employed horse-drawn contraptions to sweep up the manure produced by all the horses on the streets. This is one of those devices, \"brushing a long swathe of mire up,\" and at the end of the episode the horse pulling the machine adds three of its own \"turds\" to the mess it is wading through—a distinctly creaturely action. But Joyce also sprinkles the passage with some strange mechanical details that threaten to turn this straining, defecating animal into no less a machine than the carriage it pulls, making it a \"ship of the street.\" These symbolic colorations have the outlandish effect of making the horse reenact the sinking of the Titanic.",
    "expandedNote": " Some phrases present the horse as very much a fleshly animal: \"a fourwalker, a hipshaker, a blackbuttocker, a taildangler, a headhanger,\" \"a good poor brute,\" \"a big nervous foolish noodly kind of a horse.\" But some odd word choices also seem to remove this recognizable animal entirely from what Stephen in Scylla and Charybdis calls \"the whatness of allhorse.\" The first is Bloom's admonition to Stephen, \"Our lives are in peril tonight. Beware of the steamroller.\" Some of the street-sweeping machines of this time did carry large bristled rollers, and perhaps some of them had steam engines, but there is nothing remotely steam-powered about this one. Probably Bloom's warning emphasizes the size and power of the apparition he comes upon in the dark, unable to quite make it out (steamrollers were invented in the 1860s). But the fanciful comparison distinctly overstates the case and injects a mechanical element of steam-power that his senses could hardly be registering.\n Two sentences later Bloom gets a good look at the animal \"quite near so that it seemed new, a different grouping of bones and even flesh.\" Again, the characterization seems excessive. Bloom may be seeing the horse in a new way, or even seeing clearly for the first time that it is a horse, but that freshness of perception would hardly make it new. Indeed, as a \"headhanger\" it seems old and tired. But later in the same paragraph, Bloom's thoughts do provide a context for seeing the animal as a different grouping of bones and flesh: \"But even a dog, he reflected, take that mongrel in Barney Kiernan's, of the same size, would be a holy horrorto face. But it was no animal's fault in particular if he was built that way like the camel, ship of the desert, distilling grapes into potheen in his hump.\" \n So a principle of metamorphosis is at work. Struck by the great size of the animal looming up in the dark, Bloom imagines it as being somewhat like a towering camel. But the phrase \"ship of the desert\" complicates this picture. It is a cliché, certainly, in a chapter chockablock full of clichés, and Bloom's repetition of the tired commonplace might be dismissed as simply a reflexive mental action. In the context of fantastic substitutions, however, it threatens to take the morphing horse out of the animal kingdom altogether. And, sure enough, three sentences later the narrative voice of the chapter affirms Bloom's inconvenient comparison-within-a-comparison: \"These timely reflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mind somewhat distracted from Stephen's words while the ship of the street was manoeuvring and Stephen went on about the highly interesting old...\"\n Not only has the horse now been narratively authorized as a ship, but it is \"manoeuvring\" through the avenue, like troops on campaign or warships in formation. Individual sentient beings are sometimes said to perform such an action (\"She had mastered the delicate maneuver\"), but one would hardly expect a poor horse to do so outside of the dressage ring. Looking back to a sentence just before the remark about the steamroller, one can see that this is not the first inappropriate verb that has been applied to the horse: \"By the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn.\" Has anyone ever seen a horse swerve? The word is usually applied to vehicles, and in this case the vehicle would seem to be large and unwieldy, like a Boeing 747 initiating a turn—or like an immense passenger liner trying to avoid an iceberg. \n In an unpublished paper presented to the summer 2019 Trieste Joyce School, Senan Molony argues that echoes of the 1912 sinking of the Titanic pervade Eumaeus, and that many of those echoes sound in this passage. Titanic was \"steam\"-powered, and it plowed through ocean \"rollers.\" It was brand, spanking \"new,\" celebrating its maiden voyage from the U.K. to the U.S., and that passage proved to be a \"holy horror.\" The ship was named for the horrible giants that assaulted the holy citadel of the Greek gods, and the iceberg with which it crossed paths caused unfathomable horror by ripping gaping holes in six of its watertight compartments. (The vessel was designed to withstand rupture of three.) \n Two more details catch Molony's attention: \"The horse having reached the end of his tether, so to speak, halted and, rearing high a proud feathering tail, added his quota by letting fall on the floor, which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three smoking globes of turds. Slowly three times, one after another, from a full crupper, he mired.\" If the horse somehow predicts the Titanic, then its turds are the ship's lifeboats, dropping away from the doomed vessel. \n The second, closely related, detail is the location of the ship's sinking: \"Beresford Place,\" at the rear of the Custom House. In addition to the man for whom this broad avenue was actually named—John Beresford, a Wide Streets Commissioner—Molony detects allusions to several individuals relevant to the actions being described: \"In 1887 an Admiral Charles Beresford chaired a House of Commons Select Committee on Saving Life at Sea. His committee recommended 'that all sea-going passenger ships should be compelled by law to carry such boats, and other life-saving apparatus, as would in the aggregate best provide for the safety of all on board in moderate weather.' A quarter of a century later, in 1912, the same Admiral Lord Beresford, now an MP, is back, and being widely quoted about lifeboat provision on board the Titanic.\" Another Beresford was involved in the same battle of regulatory oversight: in 1872, \"a Francis Beresford MP tabled an amendment to legislation proposing that 'certificates should not be granted to passenger ships unless they are provided with lifeboats and deck rafts sufficient to save all on board in case of disaster or shipwreck.'\" \n Neither of these men is explicitly named in Ulysses, so perhaps their connection with the scandalously inadequate number of lifeboats aboard the Titanic can be dismissed as coincidence. But yet another Beresford does make an appearance in Cyclops: \"Sir John Beresford, of earlier date, a Royal Navy disciplinarian who is denounced by the Citizen for giving miscreant sailors the lash. Remarkably, his middle name is ‘Poo.’ Sir John Poo Beresford. And here’s a horse doing a poo in Beresford Place…\" Why, one may ask, would Joyce have attached an individual's name to the savage discipline of the British navy if he had not been planning to make something of that name in a later chapter?\n If Molony's reading of all these strange details is not too ingenious (and no one who studies the works of James Joyce should be too quick to level that charge!), then one wonders not only at the deliberate anachronism of Joyce's symbolism, but also at how he compares the lowering of the Titanic's lifeboats to the defecations of a horse. The first puzzle may perhaps be resolved by invoking an ambitious device of literary realism that Joyce borrowed from Dante. The second perhaps lends itself to cruder analysis. Noting that the stunning wreck of the great vessel provoked heated public debate among Joseph Conrad, Arthur Conan Doyle, and George Bernard Shaw, Molony sees subversive scatalogical humor at play. \"In making poo of the great iconic event of April 1912,\" he speculates, Joyce comments on these \"high-profile literary spats on the cause and meaning of the Titanic disaster, and the response it should provoke.\" They \"can only have fascinated the author of Ulysses as he watched established luminaries in an unedifying slugfest. . . . All this, Joyce proclaims, will pass—and in the horse’s case, will pass literally. It is withering, steaming criticism.\""

  "040059shortknock": {
    "note": " Early on in Calypso Joyce repeatedly introduces his readers to a feature of Bloom's mind that will reappear throughout the day: his preoccupation with schemes for making and saving money. In several passages from this part of the book, he thinks of ways that sharp people make a quick profit, often by transgressing moral and legal boundaries. Bloom himself appears concerned to stay on the right side of these lines, but he is keenly interested in other people's dodgier schemes, and his thoughts are full of contemporary Irish and British idioms for such actions.",
    "expandedNote": " His father-in-law Brian Tweedy, Bloom thinks, \"had brains enough to make that corner in stamps. Now that was farseeing.\" To corner a market means buying up a controlling share of the limited supply, so Tweedy, Gifford infers, \"had apparently bought up all available copies of an unusual stamp before the stamp was recognized as valuable.\" Such an action would indeed be farseeing. Bloom's own purchase of a used raincoat from the \"lost property office\" was a less spectacular coup: \"Railroad stations,\" Gifford notes, \"had periodic sales to dispose of unclaimed lost articles.\"\n Other details suggest unethical and possibly criminal conspiracies. Of the bed that he and Molly sleep on, Bloom recalls that Tweedy \"Bought it at the governor's auction\" in Gibraltar. \"Got a short knock.\" The bidding at an auction ends with the rapping of a gavel, so a short knock would mean a hastily concluded bidding process—perhaps because the auctioneer corruptly intended to guarantee the success of a particular bidder and minimize his cost. This supposition coheres with Bloom's suspicion that many British officers are \"in the swim\": \"In league with each other in schemes to make money,\" in Gifford's gloss. Historical records are stuffed with such schemes by military officers. \n A bit later in Calypso Bloom wonders how pub owners become so rich. There is a \"General thirst\" in Dublin, but \"Then think of the competition.\" \"Off the drunks perhaps,\" he supposes. He tries to figure in his head what kinds of margins the publicans might make and how much income it would produce, but detours into imagining that conspiracies are involved: \"On the wholesale orders perhaps. Doing a double shuffle with the town travellers. Square it with the boss and we'll split the job, see?\" Gifford glosses double shuffle as \"A trick, a piece of fakery (after a hornpipe step that involves shuffling both feet twice). 'Town travelers' are traveling salesmen. The 'double shuffle' would thus amount to some manipulation of wholesale prices by getting the salesman to overcharge and then split the proceeds.\" \n Bloom himself dreams up countless ways to get rich quick. Ithaca uses the word \"scheme\" ten times in the space of one page as it catalogues a fantastic array of such plans that he has conceived. But there is nothing criminal about Bloom's plans: they range from sheer wish-fulfillment (happening upon an undiscovered seam of gold ore, accidentally discovering a rare postage stamp) to ideas for civic improvements that Bloom lacks both the resources and the know-how to see into development. He dreams these big happy dreams of wealth, Ithaca notes, because they help him to get to sleep at night. \n It appears that Bloom was once nearly arrested for selling, or attempting to sell, some Hungarian lottery tickets that were not sanctioned by the Irish authorities. But he is no financial shark. He is one of the great mass of human beings who work hard to get by and who wonder why a small number of plutocrats have all the money: \"This owner, that. Landlord never dies they say. Other steps into his shoes when he gets his notice to quit. They buy the place up with gold and still they have all the gold. Swindle in it somewhere\" (Lestrygonians). \n Despite his honesty and his lack of true plutocratic credentials, Ithaca makes clear that Bloom is quite well off by Dublin standards, and many other Dubliners have their own conspiratorial speculations about how the Jew in their midst has managed to amass his wealth. As Hugh Kenner writes in \"The Rhetoric of Silence\" (JJQ 14.4), \"Joyce is careful not to discount too much the stereotype of Semitic fiscal cunning\" (389)."

    "note": " In Scylla and Charybdis, prompted by John Eglinton, Stephen associates Shakespeare’s unhappy wedlock with Socrates’ marriage to “A shrew” named \"Xanthippe,\" and in Circe he adds a third great man to the club: \"We have shrewridden Shakespeare and henpecked Socrates. Even the allwisest Stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of love.” Shakespeare allegedly hated his wife, Anne Hathaway. Socrates was hated by Xanthippe. As for Aristotle (the “Stagyrite”), Stephen is referring to a Renaissance-era misogynistic woodcut that shows Aristotle ridden like a horse by his lover Herpyllis.",
    "expandedNote": " Socrates, according to the Symposium of his student Xenophon, held that “woman’s nature is nowise inferior to man’s” and that women should receive the same education as men—a radical view in ancient Athens. But in this work Antisthenes records the view that Xanthippe, Socrates’ much younger wife, was “of all the wives that are, indeed that ever will be, I imagine, the most shrewish.” Antisthenes asks Socrates why he does not teach his own wife, to which Socrates replies: \"Well now, I will tell you. I follow the example of the rider who wishes to become an expert horseman: 'None of your soft-mouthed, docile animals for me,' he says; 'the horse for me to own must show some spirit': in the belief, no doubt, if he can manage such an animal, it will be easy enough to deal with every other horse besides. And that is just my case. I wish to deal with human beings, to associate with man in general; hence my choice of wife. I know full well, if I can tolerate her spirit, I can with ease attach myself to every human being else.\" Antisthenes comments: \"To wit, if he can tame this shrew, he can tame all others\" (all passages translated by H. G. Dakyns). \n Aristotle held a more unpleasant view of women than Socrates. He believed that some humans were born to be slaves and some to be rulers. Women were born slaves (though superior to barbarians) because, according to sentences quoted by Fred Miller in an article on Aristotle's political theory in The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, “the male is by nature more capable of leadership than the female” and “females require male supervision.” As perhaps befits this harsh opinion, Antisthenes' image of Socrates taming and riding a shrew was reversed in an early 16th century representation of Aristotle by the Strasbourg painter Hans Baldung, who was known for antifeminist views. \n Contrary to the spirit of Baldung's image, and to the way in which Shakespeare treated his wife in his will, there is evidence that Aristotle was kindly disposed to the women in his life. \"Antiquity mentions,\" says Stephen in Scylla and Charybdis, that when dying he \"frees and endows his slaves, pays tribute to his elders, wills to be laid in earth near the bones of his dead wife and bids his friends be kind to an old mistress (don't forget Nell Gwynn Herpyllis) and let her live in his villa.\" Gifford notes that the ancient authority is \"Diogenes Laertius (fl. third century B.C.), who reports in his Lives of the Philosophers that Aristotle's will freed and endowed some of his slaves, commissioned a statue of his mother, and directed that he be buried with his wife, Pythias, and that his concubine, Herpyllis (apocryphal?) was to be allowed to live out her life in one of his houses.\" \n Xanthippe is mentioned in The Taming of the Shrew: Petruchio goes on and on about how he would marry anyone for her money, even one “shrewd / As Socrates’ Xanthippe or a worse” (1.2.71-72). Shakespeare's own wife was thought to be a shrew by one eminent scholar in Joyce’s day. In The Man Shakespeare and His Tragic Life Story (1909), Frank Harris argues that Shakespeare had a “loathing for his wife [that] was measureless.” He observes that Anne gave birth to their first child, Susanna Shakespeare, a mere six months after their wedding, and that Shakespeare was granted two marriage certificates in 1582, one to an Anne Whately and the other to Anne Hathaway. Harris argues that these are two different people and that Shakespeare had his heart set on marrying Whately but was stymied when Hathaway’s relatives forced him to marry the then-three months pregnant Hathaway. (Others believe that Whately and Hathaway are, in fact, the same person. The Oxford Companion to Shakespeare (2001) notes that Whately is “almost certainly the result of clerical error,” and that Harris “became a popular sensation by interpreting the plays as the intimate autobiography of a turbulent soul.”)\n Harris muses that “if Shakespeare had married Anne Whately he might never have gone to London or written a play,” and it seems that Stephen too may be associating the intellectual work of some great thinkers with their marital troubles. When Lynch mocks him in Circe for talking of philosophy in an infamous red-light district, Stephen answers him by saying that three of the most brilliant men of western culture were bitted, bridled, mounted, and ridden by a \"light of love\"—a sexually desirable but difficult woman. \n When Eglinton challenges him in Scylla and Charybdis to say \"What useful discovery did Socrates learn from Xanthippe?,\" Stephen replies, \"Dialectic.\" Shortly later, he imagines Shakespeare trudging off to London with a grievance that was personal, but not sexual: \"Is Katharine the shrew illfavoured? Hortensio calls her young and beautiful. Do you think the writer of Antony and Cleopatra, a passionate pilgrim, had his eyes in the back of his head that he chose the ugliest doxy in all Warwickshire to lie withal? Good: he left her and gained the world of men.\""

    "note": " \"He peered sideways up and gave a long low whistle of call, then paused awhile in rapt attention . . . Two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm.\" What is happening here? Mulligan seems to be wryly, apishly sending a request up to God in heaven (the “old chap” of the following paragraph), and, astonishingly, receiving confirmation in the form of a quite audible reply. Has the mock mass suddenly turned seriously successful?",
    "expandedNote": " In \"Preparatory to Anything Else: Introduction to Joyce's Hades,\"Journal of Modern Literature 24: (2001): 363-499, Robert Bell articulates the most plausible explanation: Mulligan \"expects that at this time every morning he will hear the whistle of 'the mailboat clearing the harbor mouth of Kingstown'\" (369). If the mailboat announced its departure from the harbor with a steam whistle, this would account very well for the \"strong shrill\" quality of the blasts. Knowing that he can reliably predict this aural phenomenon (the mailboats were rigorously punctual), Mulligan has practiced his summoning of the sound as a parlor trick to demonstrate his intimate communication with the Almighty. [2019] And, as Robert Nicholson points out in The Ulysses Guide: Tours through Joyce's Dublin (New Island, 2015), he would be able to rely on a visual cue to time his prediction exactly: \"the jet of steam in the harbour would have been visible a couple of seconds before the sound reached the tower\" (19).\n Thinking less realistically, commentators have searched for symbolic parallels to the two whistles that Mulligan receives from the ether. Gifford notes that the server in the Mass rings a handbell to announce the moment of consecration of the host, when, as the celebrant speaks the words, “This is my body . . . this is my blood,” transubstantiation occurs. Jorn Barger notes a resemblance to the passage in Book 2 of the Odyssey in which Zeus sends two eagles into view in the sky as an encouraging sign to Telemachus that his father will return to wreak destruction on the suitors. Neither supposed allusion seems definitive, but they do augment the impression of divine approval."

Prompted perhaps by Mulligan's ongoing impersonation of a priest and his mention of \"the dissectingroom,\" he thinks of the \"voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there is of her but her woman's unclean loins.\" Like doctors, priests attend the dying, preparing their parishioners for holy burial.",
    "expandedNote": " Thornton cites an article by Willis E. McNelly, “Liturgical Deviations in Ulysses,” JJQ 2 (1965): 291-98, on the Catholic sacrament of extreme unction, in which the priest comforts the dying by anointing with olive oil “the eyes, the ears, the nostrils, the mouth, the hand, the feet, and the loins. Yet the annointing [sic] of the feet may be omitted for any good reason, and the unction of the loins is always to be omitted if the subject is a woman” (297).\n As in most liturgical and theological matters, Stephen is well versed in the arcane particulars of extreme unction. \"All there is of\" the old woman will be oiled for the grave except her genitals, those \"unclean loins\" that Stephen has not yet managed to secularize."

There will be many others in Proteus.\n In this case, he imagines his relatives peering out from behind shuttered windows, looking to see if a bill collector (\"dun\") is at the door. Doing his legal work at home in bed, the half-naked Richie orders his son Walter about like a military subordinate, orders Stephen to sit down in a room that has no chair in it, gives orders for his wife (who is busy bathing a baby) to bring whiskey for the visitor, offers him food that the house does not contain.

    "expandedNote": " At the turn of the century Siam, the kingdom that preceded the 20th century state of Thailand, was pressured by French colonial ambitions on its eastern flank and British colonial ambitions in the northwest and south. These great European imperial powers, especially the French, repeatedly demanded territorial concessions from Siam. A 1904 Franco-Siamese \"convention\" ratified and expanded concessions extorted in 1867, 1888, and 1893. An Anglo-French convention, also in 1904, defined Siam's territory relative to the British holdings in Burma and Malaysia, and the French ones in Indochina. Siam suffered further losses in 1907 and 1909.\n One ambition of empires, explored in Yuval Noah Harari's Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind (2011), is to spread their culture—language, religion, learning, political and legal systems, technological and industrial skills, art, leisure habits—to subject populations. But the process is seldom unilateral. The hegemon may absorb cultural practices and even leaders from the provinces, and its own values and ideas may be turned against it: \"Many anti-colonial struggles were waged under the banners of self-determination, socialism and human rights, all of which are Western legacies\" (225). India, unified under the British raj, was led to independence by Mohandas Gandhi, who studied law in London, mastered English speech and manners, absorbed European values, and insisted that they be applied abroad as they were at home. \n The Siamese student is no Gandhi: his country has not yet been swallowed by an imperial power. But the \"strategy\" he is studying would seem to involve using French political or military theories to resist the French conqueror next door. Readers may want to reflect on the fact that Stephen is committed to a similar project: using the English language, and the cultural inheritance that comes with it, to write \"Our national epic.\""

In Nausicaa Bloom thinks of Molly \"leaned on the sideboard watching\" him as he performed charades in Luke Doyle's house.

  "030020signatures": {
    "note": " A mystical element runs through Stephen's meditations on the \"Ineluctable modality of the visible.\" Thinking \"Signatures of all things I am here to read,\" he recalls the De Signatura Rerum (\"On the Signatures of Things\"), published in 1622 by a Lutheran theologian named Jakob Böhme (usually written Boehme in English).",
    "expandedNote": " Boehme had a number of mystical experiences as a young man, including one in 1600 in which the sight of a sunbeam reflected in a metal dish revealed to him the spiritual beauty of the universe. Further visions included one in which he walked out into the fields and saw there signs of the divine creator visibly manifested in all created things. Stephen aspires to \"read\" such divine signatures in the sights he encounters on the seashore: \"seaspawn and seawrack, the nearing tide, that rusty boot. Snotgreen, bluesilver, rust: coloured signs.\" \n The mystical burden of the Signatura appears in Stephen's thoughts in the next paragraph, as he closes his eyes and turns his attention to \"the ineluctable modality of the audible\": \"Am I walking into eternity along Sandymount strand?\" The answer, unfortunately, is No. When he opens his eyes two paragraphs later the created world has not \"vanished,\" and he is not \"for ever in the black adiaphane\".\n The Signatura argues that direct apprehensions of divine truth are a necessary complement to mere faith. Gifford quotes from the beginning of the work: \"All whatever is spoken, written or taught of God, without the knowledge of the signature is dumb and void of understanding; for it proceeds only from an historical conjecture, from the mouth of another, wherein the spirit without knowledge is dumb; but if the spirit opens to him the signature, then he understands the speech of another; and further, he understands how the spirit has manifested and revealed itself . . .\" \n This argument falls within a long Christian tradition of regarding the Book of Nature as a second source of divine revelation, complementary to the Book of Scripture. But a thread of Neoplatonism runs through Boehme's writings and, like many mystics, he took some doctrinal positions that violated orthodox theological teaching, arousing opposition from Lutheran authorities. \n In an endnote to his biography, Ellmann reproduces the surviving part of an inventory that Joyce made of his books before leaving Trieste (785-87). On the list is \"Jacob Behmen, The Signature of All Things.\" Apparently Joyce read the work in this 17th century English translation by John Sparrow, from which Gifford quotes."

  "030137silentship": {
    "note": " Having lobbed out one highly suggestive image in \"crosstrees,\" the final sentence of the Telemachiad concludes with another: \"homing, upstream, silently moving, a silent ship.\" If Stephen's protean wrestlings in the third chapter somehow reenact the efforts of Homer's Telemachus to learn about his father's whereabouts (by questioning Menelaus, who questioned Proteus), then this silent ship may somehow reenact Odysseus' stealthy return to his home in Ithaca.",
    "expandedNote": " Other details conspire with the words \"silent\" and \"homing\" to create this impression. Just before turning to see the ship, Stephen has thought, \"Behind. Perhaps there is someone.\" He may only be worrying that someone has seen him picking his nose (he has reached for his handkerchief, only to realize that he never picked it up when Mulligan threw it to him in Telemachus), but the thought that \"someone\" is coming to town on that ship is effectively insinuated into the reader's mind. \n A reader of Joyce's fictions, in particular, may think of Odysseus. In \"An Encounter,\" the second story of Dubliners, the two boys who are \"miching\" from school walk along the quays on the north side of the Liffey and see a \"graceful threemaster\" being unloaded on the opposite side of the river. They take a ferry across to watch, and the protagonist looks at \"the foreign sailors to see had any of them green eyes for I had some confused notion. . . . .\" The boy's unexplained \"notion\" is probably the medieval one that Odysseus had green eyes. (This tradition has been perpetuated in modern culture. Glyn Iliffe's recent popular novel The Voyage of Odysseus, for instance, gives the hero \"green eyes.\")\n Joyce's Odysseus, Leopold Bloom, will appear on the very next page of the novel, so the final words of the Telemachiad read like a prophetic transition, a linking of expectant son to triumphantly returning father. But symbolic connections tend not to cohere quite so neatly in Joyce's fictions. Bloom is not arriving on a schooner on June 16; he is conducting everyday business as a citizen of Dublin. And symbolically, he has only started on his journey from Calypso's island to an Ithacan homecoming. \n Even in \"An Encounter,\" the boy's search for an adventure is not fulfilled in quite the way he has hoped for. The man he eventually encounters, with \"a pair of bottle-green eyes peering at me from under a twitching forehead,\" is no Ulysses. And this \"queer old josser,\" a leering and demented substitute for the expected hero, will have his counterpart in Ulysses.In Eumaeus Stephen will find that there indeed was \"someone\" on the ship, name of W. B. Murphy. He too is a very disappointing Odysseus."

  "170009sinbadsailor": {
    "note": " As Bloom drifts off to sleep at the end of Ithaca, his mind reels woozily through a long series of alliterative names, and then some inchoate thoughts about a fabulous bird's egg, both inspired by a Christmas pantomime. In Surface and Symbol, Robert Martin Adams observes that along with \"Sinbad the Sailor,\" \"Tinbad\" and \"Whinbad\" were characters in the Sinbad pantomime performed in Dublin in 1892 and 1893 (80). Various other kinds of significance can be inferred from these sentences: Bloom's identification with the fabulous voyager Odysseus, his love of nursery rhymes, the fascination with wealth embedded in stories of the \"roc,\" and much, much more. But the reader should not lose sight of the main object of representation: a mind entering the mysterious passage from daytime consciousness to sleep, where thoughts begin to morph into dream. Any coherence that may inhere in these images smacks as much of the obscurities of Finnegans Wake as of the lucidities of Ulysses.",
    "expandedNote": " Bloom is an Odysseus who has returned home to his Ithaca, and at the end of his day the narrative says, \"He rests. He has travelled.\" It then poses a question: \"With?\" The answer is Sinbad (or Sindbad), an 8th or 9th century Arabian hero whose seven voyages unquestionably owe much to those of Homer's hero. (The Odyssey was translated into Arabic by the 8th century, and the story of Polyphemos is retold in Sinbad's third voyage.) Sinbad thus joins Rip Van Winkle, Enoch Arden, the Wandering Jew, and a small host of fellow travelers who function as additional symbolic analogues for Bloom's Odyssean mental adventures.\n The presence of Tinbad and Whinbad in the Christmas pantomime has evidently also prompted Bloom to transpose Sinbad's story into his beloved register of nursery rhyme, where silly verbal resemblances can drive a story forward and people can become fancifully identified with their occupations (Tinbad the Tailor, Jinbad the Jailer, Whinbad the Whaler, Ninbad the Nailer, Binbad the Bailer, Pinbad the Pailer, Minbad the Mailer, Hinbad the Hailer, Rinbad the Railer). It is perhaps not too great a stretch to hear in these phrases all the occupations that Bloom has encountered people practicing in the course of his day, or remembered himself practicing in earlier years, or imagined himself practicing in a different life. (In Circe Bloom's adventures of June 16 are cast as a similar-sounding series of hagiographic attributes: \"Kidney of Bloom, pray for us. / Flower of the bath, pray for us. / Mentor of Menton, pray for us. / Canvasser for the Freeman, pray for us. . . .\")\n And then comes the final paragraph of the episode, when, asking itself the strange question \"When?,\" the narrative locates Bloom on a temporal slide into unconsciousness: \"Going to dark bed there was a square round Sinbad the Sailor roc's auk's egg in the night of the bed of all the auks of the rocs of Darkinbad the Brightdayler.\" The bed to which Bloom is going becomes the site of a bewildering host of associations, as if his mind is speeding up rather than slowing down. The bed is dark, anticipating the black extinction of consciousness expressed in the large black dot at the end of the chapter. And before any egg appears, we learn that it is \"square round,\" a paradoxical figure that evokes the mathematical challenge referred to earlier in Ithaca as \"the quadrature of the circle.\" \n Why should Bloom be thinking such a thought at this moment? Given the temporal element (\"Going to dark bed\"), it seems reasonable to hear an echo of the end of the Paradiso, where Dante uses the famous mathematical challenge to characterize his last moment of ordinary human consciousness before the flash of mystical enlightenment. Staring into the divine abyss, he describes his struggle to understand the mystery of Incarnation: \n Like the geometer who fully applies himself \n to square the circle and, for all his thought, \n cannot discover the principle he lacks, \n such was I at that strange new sight.\n I tried to see how the image fit the circle\n and how it found its where in it. (33.133-37)\n Dante writes that he would have failed to comprehend an essentially transcendental entity (like God, the circle's constitutive principle of π has now been shown to be such an entity) \"had not my mind been struck by a bolt / of lightning that granted what I asked\" (141-42). After his mind's fruitless efforts at logical comprehension, a mystical vision sweeps him up into the Love moving the sun and the other stars and concludes the epic poem. If this allusion lurks within Bloom's phrase \"square round,\" it serves to characterize Bloom's coming entry into the realm of sleep and dream, which waking intelligence cannot comprehend.\n The roc's egg participates in these mysteries, but it carries multiple associations of its own. In the Sinbad stories, the roc is an enormous raptor, powerful enough to carry elephants and huge snakes to its nest to feed its young. In his second voyage Sinbad hitches a ride on a roc to the valley of diamonds, and then he tricks one into carrying him back to its nest. On another voyage, the fifth, his crew spots an immense roc's egg, breaks it open, and eats the chick, bringing destruction down upon themselves from the avian parents much as Homer's men do when they kill the cattle of the sun god. \n Joyce may still be injecting echoes of the Commedia into Bloom's thoughts here: Dante's pilgrim gets his first taste of mystical rapture in canto 9 of Purgatorio when, in a dream, an eagle carries him Ganymede-like into the sphere of fire, filling him with terror. But the roc also has powerful associations with Sinbad's great topic, the acquisition of wealth. (He tells his tales to a poor man, also named Sinbad, who wants to know why some people enjoy great riches while others must endure poverty.) Getting to the valley of diamonds by roc, and thence to a roc's nest, has enriched the hero with a trove of gems. \n It seems highly likely not only that this part of the Sinbad story would appeal to the money-conscious Bloom, but also that he would think of it at bedtime. Earlier in Ithaca, he has contemplated various fantastic schemes for getting rich, one of them involving finding \"an antique dynastical ring\" that has been \"dropped by an eagle in flight.\" The narrative asks why Bloom should think of such outlandish ideas. Answer: he has found that happily fantasizing about wealth before going to bed helps him to sleep well.\n All of these speculations about Bloom's thought processes in his last moments of consciousness seem tenuous, and the chains of association become yet more slender at the end of the final sentence. Why does the roc become an \"auk,\" a group of diving Atlantic sea-birds in the alcid family? Certainly not because of size: even the extinct (ca. 1852) great auk stood no higher than about 3 feet (1 meter). As with the nursery-rhyme variations on Sinbad, the link may be purely linguistic, one \"oc\" sound childishly engendering another. As for \"Darkinbad the Brightdayler,\" Adams supposes there may be a \"subtle reference to Max Müller's theory that Odysseus was originally a sun-god\" (Surface and Symbol, 81). \n But as Adams goes on to cogently observe, at some point such serious investigations should be cut off, because \"the going-to-bed litany is a piece of inspired stupidity, like Charles Bovary's famous hat, containing layer after layer of meaninglessness—an unfathomable depth of mental void. Relaxing its hold on external reality, and on its own thought processes, the mind is shown drifting off into a mechanical word-cuddling, and so into complete darkness. The more we project conscious intellectual meaning into the process, the less it serves its overt purpose. Like a Rorschach-blot, the passage will absorb anything we want to put into it, but there is a point at which our insertions, by expressing 'us' all too richly, frustrate the ends of the novel\" (82).\n This caveat serves a valuable purpose. Bloom's muddy half-thoughts are certainly more than a little stupid, as are those of every human being drifting off to sleep. But readers can also benefit from the hindsight of knowing something of the book that Joyce wrote next. Finnegans Wake, the ultimate Rorschach blot, suggests that in sleep thousands of suggestive threads of meaning become tied together in patterns that do not respect the laws of daylight logic but are easily as complex as waking thoughts. Could Joyce already have been thinking of his book of the dark when he finished Ithaca? A note full of tendentious suppositions may as well conclude with one more: amid the list of Sinbad's alliterative cousins is one, \"Finbad the Failer,\" whose name richly evokes the next defeated conqueror on Joyce's horizon."

    "note": " After perhaps recalling fragments of two nursery rhymes from Mother Goose early in Calypso—the echoes are tenuous, fragmentary—Bloom thinks quite specifically and repeatedly of another one later in the chapter and in Lotus Eaters: \"Sing a song of sixpence.\" Like the children's lessons and stories of Finnegans Wake, the silly images in this song that parents sing to their children are made to convey some pressing adult concerns, especially the marital discord in the Bloom household.",
    "expandedNote": " The ditty probably originated in the 18th century. Its most familiar modern verses go as follows:\n Sing a song of sixpence,\n A pocket full of rye.\n Four and twenty blackbirds,\n Baked in a pie.\n When the pie was opened\n The birds began to sing—\n Wasn't that a dainty dish\n To set before the king?\n The king was in the counting-house,\n Counting out his money;\n The queen was in the parlour,\n Eating bread and honey.\n The maid was in the garden,\n Hanging out the clothes;\n Along came a blackbird\n And pecked off her nose. \n The two most disturbing events of the song are the baking of live birds in a pie (an Italian recipe for such culinary entertainments survives from the 16th century, and there are contemporary reports that some were prepared for the wedding of Marie de' Medici and Henry IV of France in 1600), and the mutilation of the maid's face. But Joyce focused on three other, seemingly benign details, finding in each one elements of Bloom's intimate adult concerns.\n One allusion to the song comes when Bloom is preparing to sit down in the outhouse: \"He kicked open the crazy door of the jakes. Better be careful not to get these trousers dirty for the funeral. He went in, bowing his head under the low lintel. Leaving the door ajar, amid the stench of mouldy limewash and stale cobwebs he undid his braces. Before sitting down he peered through a chink up at the nextdoor window. The king was in his countinghouse. Nobody.\" With no one visible next door, the paterfamilias takes his seat upon the throne and voids his bowels, reflecting with satisfaction that the constipation from which he suffered on the previous day has now lessened its grip. \n It is surely relevant here that Sigmund Freud, in \"Character and Anal Eroticism\" (1908), argued for an association in the unconscious mind between feces and money. Joyce had already displayed an interest in the ideas of this essay when he wroteA Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. In Joyce Between Freud and Jung (Kennikat Press, 1980), Sheldon Brivic applies some of them to reading the sentences in which Stephen, newly enriched by school prizes, tries to order his world by controlling the flow of money: \"In his coat pockets he carried . . . chocolate for his guests while his trousers' pockets bulged with masses of silver and copper coins. . . . the money ran through Stephen's fingers. . . . He had tried to build a breakwater of order and elegance against the sordid tide of life without him and to dam up, by rules . . . interests . . . and new filial relations, the powerful recurrence of the tides within him. Useless. From without as from within the water flowed over his barriers\" (45). \n In Bloom's recollection of the line about the king counting his money, this association between the flow of money and the flow of excrement becomes more directly connected with sexuality. The complex, according to Freud, is rooted in childhood experiences. Training children to use the toilet constitutes a crucial moment in the \"anal phase\" of their psychosexual development. Prior to this moment, children have an attachment to their own feces, as things that they have produced. (In Finnegans Wake Joyce presents Shem the Penman as an artist whose works are written with excrement on his own body.) But in potty training children are wheedled and shamed into relinquishing these precious parts of themselves. If they resist the adult instructions, the experience of retaining the excrement within the anus may produce sexual pleasure, and such individuals mature into adults who derive a quasi-sexual pleasure from holding onto money. Leopold Bloom, it may be noted, is notoriously tight with a ducat, and his eroticism is distinctly anal.\n Given Bloom's anal eroticism, given his wife's disinterest in it (\"its a wonder Im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with him so cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the wrong end of me not knowing I suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a womans bottom Id throw my hat at him after that hed kiss anything unnatural where we havent 1 atom of any kind of expression in us all of us the same 2 lumps of lard before ever Id do that to a man pfooh the dirty brutes the mere thought is enough I kiss the feet of you senorita theres some sense in that\"), given the sexual dysfunction that consequently exists in the marriage, and given the alienation that will result from Boylan's visit on this day, it seems appropriate that Bloom thinks of the nursery rhyme at a moment when he and Molly are in separate rooms, doing separate things. In Lotus Eaters the lines about the queen float back into Bloom's head as he remembers Molly lying in bed eating the slices of toast he brought her and reading Boylan's letter: \"Mrs Marion Bloom. Not up yet. Queen was in her bedroom eating bread and.\"\n Bloom of course has his own extramarital fascinations, and the nursery rhyme manages to embrace those as well. Its picture of the maid \"in the garden, / Hanging out the clothes\" is reproduced physically in the actions of the young woman whom Bloom stands beside in the butcher's shop. He recognizes her as \"the nextdoor girl,\" a servant recently employed by his neighbours on Eccles Street: \"His eyes rested on her vigorous hips. Woods his name is. Wonder what he does. Wife is oldish. New blood. No followers allowed. Strong pair of arms. Whacking a carpet on the clothesline. She does whack it, by George. The way her crooked skirt swings at each whack.\"\n When Bloom exits his back door to go to the outhouse, this attractively aggressive young woman enters his thoughts again via the strains of the nursery rhyme: \"He went out through the backdoor into the garden: stood to listen towards the next garden. No sound. Perhaps hanging clothes out to dry. The maid was in the garden. Fine morning.\" His voyeuristic delectation of this \"nextdoor girl\" that he has seen in the backyard anticipates his looking up from the yard \"at the nextdoor window\" later in Calypso, forming a perfect circularity among the three figures in the song. \"Sing a song of sixpence\" describes an unhappy love triangle as evocatively as do any of Bloom's thoughts about Boylan and Molly later in the novel."

    "note": " From 1876 to 1905 \"Sir Frederick Falkiner\" was the Recorder of Dublin, an important magistrate with the immense task of overseeing much of the city's day-to-day orderly functioning. In Lestrygonians Bloom sees him going into the Freemasons' Hall \"Solemn as Troy. After his good lunch in Earlsfort terrace.\" Other characters think about him during the day, particularly in Cyclops where legal cases are on everyone's lips.",
    "expandedNote": " In Cyclops, Alf Bergan comments on two well-known qualities of this real-life magistrate: his reputation as the \"poor man's judge,\" and his bias against Jews. It is easy to sway the judge, he says: \"— Poor old sir Frederick, says Alf, you can cod him up to the two eyes.\" Ned Lambert agrees: \"— Heart as big as a lion, says Ned. Tell him a tale of woe about arrears of rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and, faith, he'll dissolve in tears on the bench.\" Bergan notes that a Jewish moneylender who sues to Sir Frederick for recovery of funds faces an uphill battle: \"Reuben J was bloody lucky he didn't clap him in the dock the other day for suing poor little Gumley that's minding stones, for the corporation there near Butt bridge.\" \n Bergan then launches into an imitation of the exchange in the courtroom: Falkiner: \" — A most scandalous thing! This poor hardworking man! How many children? Ten, did you say?\" Gumley:\" — Yes, your worship. And my wife has the typhoid.\" Falkiner: \" — And the wife with typhoid fever! Scandalous! Leave the court immediately, sir. No, sir, I'll make no order for payment. How dare you, sir, come up before me and ask me to make an order! A poor hardworking industrious man! I dismiss the case.\"\n The Recorder's reluctance to rule in favor of Jews no doubt bears on his appearance in Circe as the judge who sentences Leopold Bloom to death: \"I will put an end to this white slave traffic and rid Dublin of this odious pest. Scandalous! (He dons the black cap) Let him be taken, Mr Subsheriff, from the dock where he now stands and detained in custody in Mountjoy prison during His Majesty's pleasure and there be hanged by the neck until he is dead and therein fail not at your peril or may the Lord have mercy on your soul.\" The subsheriff, Long John Fanning, calls out, \"Who'll hang Judas Iscariot?\"\n At the end of Cyclops, the \"violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic character\" that results from the Citizen heaving a biscuit tin at Bloom carries away \"a silk umbrella with gold handle with the engraved initials, crest, coat of arms and house number of the erudite and worshipful chairman of quarter sessions sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin.\" This ornate umbrella, which appears again in Circe, suggests the judge's high social station, as does his lunch in Earlsfort Terrace, a short street in a very fashionable part of south central Dublin, running south from St. Stephen's Green to Adelaide Road. The \"house number\" too signifies wealth: Gifford notes that Sir Frederick lived at 4 Earlsfort Terrace, just off the Green (187). Membership in the Masonic order also suggests that Sir Frederick is Protestant."

    "note": " When Bloom thinks in Ithaca about all the flowers he will plant around his luxurious country cottage, he has a particular nursery in mind: \"sir James W. Mackey Limited, wholesale and retail seed and bulb merchants and nurserymen, agents for chemical manures, 23 Sackville street, upper.\" This well-known shop, next door to the Gresham Hotel where Gretta and Gabriel stay in The Dead, had been in business at the Upper Sackville (or O'Connell) Street address since 1878. It housed \"seedsmen,\" selective breeders offering both exotic plants and improved versions of familiar ones.",
    "expandedNote": " The roots of the business, which reach back into the 18th century, are detailed in an article by Hazel P. Smyth, \"Two Hundred Years a'Growing: The Story of Mackey's Seeds Limited—1777-1977,\" Dublin Historical Record 35.3 (1982): 100-15. One of the partners in an older seeds firm called Toole and Mackey was Stephen Mackey, whose son James William Mackey inherited his portion of the business, as well as land holdings in County Cork, at his death in 1854. The younger Mackey became well respected both as a businessman and as a politician. An Alderman in the early 60s, was elected Lord Mayor in 1866 and again in 1873, and after the second term he was knighted. In 1880 he was elected High Sheriff of Dublin. Mackey died on 14 December 1892, and was buried next to his father in the family crypt in St. Andrew's church in Westland Row. \n The seeds business, located on Westmoreland Street at the time of the elder Mackey's death, divided in 1860 into Toole & Company and James W. Mackey. In 1878 the Mackey part moved to Upper Sackville Street, which at the time was a fashionable place for shopping. On 5 April 1922 it was destroyed in a fire that burned all the businesses on the east side of the street from 9 to 28, and some buildings on the west side as well. After rebuilding on the same site, the business reopened in 1925. In 1969 the Gresham Hotel swallowed up the building in an expansion, and in 1970 Mackey's Seeds Ltd. moved to Mary Street.\n § The passage in Ithaca that mentions Mackey's is textually problematic in many ways. Gabler's text contradicts all earlier editions in changing its singular nouns (\"merchant and nurseryman, agent for chemical manures\") to plurals. Although such reversals of longstanding editorial practice frequently seem arbitrary and unhelpful in the Gabler text, in this instance there are good reasons to endorse the new version. By 1904 Sir James had been dead for more than a decade, so there was no single \"man\" to correspond to the singular labels. The building's façade advertised it as a place of \"seedsmen\" and \"nurserymen.\" The listing in the 1904 edition of Thom's (p. 1585) from which Joyce was no doubt working contained the plurals quoted in the novel. And an ad published in a 1914 copy of the Carlovian, Sir James' old college magazine, proclaimed \"Ireland's Premier Seed Establishment / James W. Mackey Ltd. / Seedsmen.\" \n Other problems concern punctuation. The 1922 first edition is a disaster: \"sweet pea, lily of the valley, [bulbs obtainable, from sir James W. Mackey (Limited)] wholesale and retail seed and bulb merchant and nurseryman, agent for chemical manures, 23 Sackville Street, upper).\" The layering of hard brackets on top of parentheses is cumbersome; the brackets separate the name of the business from its description; the parenthesis after \"upper\" closes a parenthetical clause that was never opened; superfluous commas are intruded both before and after \"bulbs obtainable\"; and a necessary comma is omitted after \"Limited.\" \n The first Odyssey Press edition in 1932 removed the inept comma after \"bulbs obtainable\" and installed a complete set of parentheses around the long parenthetical clause. It removed the absurd bracketing of \"bulbs . . . (Limited),\" but replaced it with an equally absurd pair of brackets around \"wholesale and retail.\" The Bodley Head edition that became the basis of Random House and Penguin texts in the 1960s improved on this version very slightly by removing the comma after \"lily of the valley,\" but it left the brackets in place. \n The 1986 Gabler text finally did away with troublesome brackets altogether, and it may arguably be the best possible version of this tortured sentence. However, by retaining the parentheses around \"Limited\" it perpetuates the Odyssey editions' highly inelegant practice of burying parentheses within parentheses. And it does not place a comma following that word, where one seems required. To address these issues, I have made my own arbitrary decision, in editing this text for the website, to eliminate the inner set of parentheses an insert a comma: \"sir James W. Mackey Limited, wholesale and resale seed and bulb merchants.\""

    "note": " Mr. Deasy tells Stephen that he has \"rebel blood in me too,\" from his mother's side of the family, but he proudly claims descent \"from sir John Blackwood who voted for the union\": \"He voted for it and put on his topboots to ride to Dublin from the Ards of Down to do so.\" The reference is to an actual 18th century member of the Irish House of Commons, Sir John Blackwood, and his determination to ride to Dublin could be considered inspiring, given his age at the time. But once again Deasy is peddling a mangled account of history: Sir John intended to vote against the legislation.",
    "expandedNote": " According to Ellmann, Joyce learned the story from a friend who also provided the model for Deasy's letter-writing campaign. \"Henry N. Blackwood Price, an Ulsterman who was Assistant Manager of the Eastern Telegraph Company\" in Trieste, asked Joyce when he visited Ireland in 1912 to carry back news of a cure for foot-and-mouth disease that had supposedly been discovered on the Continent. In an August 7 letter to Joyce that Joyce quoted in one of his own letters to Stanislaus, Price wrote, \"Be energetic. Drop your lethargy. Forget Leinster for Ulster. Remember that Sir John Blackwood died in the act of putting on his topboots in order to go to Dublin to vote against the Union. You will get your name up if you write this up\" (325-26). Price invoked the story in a patriotic spirit: the disease scare had led England to impose an embargo on Irish cattle, and a cure could defend Ireland just as Sir John once had. \n Sir John Blackwood, 2nd Baronet of Ballyleidy, represented constituencies (Bangor and Killyleagh) in County Down, Ulster, in the Irish House of Commons from 1761 until his death at the age of 78 in 1799. The \"Ards of Down\" is a peninsula jutting into the Irish Sea east of Belfast and wrapping around the Strangford Lough. It lies nearly 100 miles away from Dublin—an extremely long ride for a man nearing his ninth decade. Consistent with the wholesale bribery that preceded the two Act of Union votes, Gifford notes that Sir John \"was offered a peerage to bribe him to vote for Union.\" He refused, but evidence suggests that his son, Sir James Blackwood, voted for the Union and was made Baron Dufferin in recompense.\n Considering the trouble that Sir John was preparing to take to resist imperial skullduggery, the motto that Deasy attributes to him, \"Per vias rectas\" (Latin: \"By straight roads\" or \"By proper means\"), seems well justified. But Mr. Deasy himself is arguing per vias pravas, crookedly."

More than anyone else, he was responsible for the improvement in Dublin's water supply in the 1860s—a great civic boon that prompted the erection of the statue four years after Gray's death in 1875.",
    "expandedNote": " As the funeral cortège passes up Sackville Street in Hades, Simon Dedalus makes an anti-Semitic joke and \"Mr Power, collapsing in laughter, shaded his face from the window as the carriage passed Gray's statue.\" At the end of the next chapter, Aeolus, the men leave the offices of the Freemans Journal to pursue some drinks at Stephen's expense, and cross Sackville Street. Considering Stephen's parable about Nelson's Pillar, Professor MacHugh looks up the street from one monument to another: \"He halted on sir John Gray's pavement island and peered aloft at Nelson through the meshes of his wry smile.\" (In the photograph at right, the modernist Spire of Dublin occupies the spot where Nelson's pillar stood until the 1960s.) \n Later in the afternoon, the jaunting car carrying Blazes Boylan to the Blooms' house turns north from the quays up Sackville Street, past several of the urban landmarks noted in Hades: \"Jingle by monuments of sir John Gray, Horatio onehandled Nelson, reverend father Theobald Mathew, jaunted as said before just now. Atrot, in heat, heatseated.\" Sirens also glances at \"Elvery's elephant\" and \"the Rotunda, Rutland square,\" likewise noted in Hades.\n Born to a Protestant family in County Mayo in 1815, Gray received a medical degree from Trinity College in 1839 and established a practice in Dublin. In the 1840s he worked as the political editor of the Freemans Journal and supported O'Connell's movement to repeal the Act of Union. He acquired joint ownership of the newspaper in 1841 and became its sole owner in 1850. During the three and a half decades in which he ran the paper and held various political offices (organizer of the Tenants' League, Dublin city councillor, alderman of the Dublin Corporation, MP for Kilkenny), Gray vigorously supported many nationalist causes: repeal of the Union, disestablishment of the Church of Ireland, land reform, reform of the court system, free denominational education, Home Rule. \n His most lasting fame, though, derived from his work to secure a reliable source of clean water for Dublin. Chairing a committee charged with finding an alternative to the tainted supplies that regularly caused outbreaks of cholera and typhoid in the city, he became a driving force in support of the \"Vartry scheme\": a plan to dam the Vartry River in County Wicklow and pipe water from the resulting reservoir to Stillorgan, a suburb south of Dublin, whence it could be distributed throughout the city. The dam was constructed in the 1860s, and when Vartry water reached Dublin it immediately improved public health. The Lord Lieutenant of Ireland knighted Gray in 1863, as the work began.\n The statue on O'Connell Street was sculpted by Sir Thomas Farrell, the same man who made the statue of William Smith O'Brien just south of the river."

    "note": " Instead of thinking of the massive stones of the Great South Wall as the work of 18th century engineers, Stephen weaves a fanciful picture of \"Sir Lout\" and other prehistoric giants, drawing together strands from Irish mythology, children's rhymes, and his own fertile imagination.",
    "expandedNote": " Frank Budgen recorded a conversation with Joyce: \"'Who are Sir Lout and his family?' I asked. 'The people who did the rough work at the beginning?' 'Yes,' said Joyce. 'They were giants right enough, but weak reproductively. Fasolt and Fafner in Das Rheingold are of the same breed, sexually weak as the music tells us. My Sir Lout has rocks in his mouth instead of teeth. He articulates badly.'\" \n Some of Lout's bad articulation (\"Feefawfum. I zmellz de bloodz odz an Iridzman\") makes clear that he derives in part from a common nursery rhyme: \"Fee, fie, fo, fum, / I smell the blood of an Englishman. / Be he alive or be he dead, / I'll grind his bones to make my bread.\" Sir Lout's domestic skills are not quite as highly cultivated as those of the giant English baker. He uses \"bones for my steppingstones.\" Some of those bones, which Stephen stares at \"proudly\" earlier in Proteus, are \"piled stone mammoth skulls.\"\n As Gifford notes, another inspiration for the idea that the wall of boulders was laid down by a giant may be the story of the origin of the Giant's Causeway, an immense array of basaltic columns that tapers off into the sea in Ulster. Legend has it that the giant Finn MacCool was taunted by a giant in Scotland and tossed rocks into the sea so that he could walk over and have it out. Perhaps it makes sense that Joyce's causeway-builder lays his stones toward England, where the nursery rhyme hails from. \n Other stories may be floating around in Stephen's teeming brain. Gifford observes that the figure called Lug of the Long Arm was \"also a rock thrower, one of whose exploits was the rock death of Balor of the Evil Eye.\""

With a kind of faint retrospective comedy, these six majestic monuments are preceded by an unprepossessing one whose honoree seems to have passed out of collective memory. Bloom thinks, \"Sir Philip Crampton's memorial fountain bust. Who was he?\"",
    "expandedNote": " Sir Philip was an Irish surgeon of the first half of the 19th century (1777-1858). He conducted a private practice but also worked at several hospitals in Dublin and founded a children's hospital to help treat poor children from the Liberties. His academic accomplishments were many: he taught anatomy in various capacities, wrote a treatise on the eyes of birds, and founded the Royal Zoological Society of Ireland, serving repeatedly as its president. He was a member of the Royal Irish Academy (a very prestigious learned society of academics), and a Fellow of the Royal Society (the even more highly prestigious London-based scientific society). He served three terms as president of the Dublin College of Surgeons.\n In 1862 a fountain designed by sculptor John Kirk was erected in Crampton's honor in the middle of the circus formed by the intersection of Great Brunswick Street, College Street, and D'Olier Street, just south of the O'Connell bridge over the Liffey. The design was exceedingly odd: a heavy triangular stone plinth with water basins in the Roman fashion, surmounted by metal sculptures of large birds (reflecting Crampton's interest in the subject) and a bust of Sir Philip, with a metal flower-like stalk rising high above the bust. Dubliners derisively called it the \"pineapple\" or the \"artichoke.\" It was removed in the 1950s because its pieces were coming apart (Yvonne Whelan, Reinventing Modern Dublin: Streetscape, Iconography, and the Politics of Identity, UCD Press, 2003).\n In Lestrygonians, when Bloom is repulsed by the squalid conditions of the Burton restaurant, he thinks with distaste of the unhygienic conditions of communal eating arrangements like those he experienced in the City Arms hotel, and connects them with those water basins on the fountain: \"Suppose that communal kitchen years to come perhaps. All trotting down with porringers and tommycans to be filled. Devour contents in the street. . . . My plate's empty. After you with our incorporated drinkingcup. Like sir Philip Crampton's fountain.

    "note": " When Bloom disapproves of cigarette smoking and Zoe says, \"Go on. Make a stump speech out of it,\" he launches into an indictment of tobacco that begins with the historical tradition that \"Sir Walter Ralegh brought from the new world that potato and that weed.\" These two plants were imported from the Americas in the early modern era, but the tradition crediting Ralegh is suspect on several counts.",
    "expandedNote": " Ralegh was a gentleman adventurer favored by Queen Elizabeth with various royal patents and charters to explore, plunder, and settle the New World. The 1580s founding of the Roanoke colony in Virginia was his venture, but he never personally traveled to North America. It is now thought that Hernández de Boncalo brought tobacco seeds to Spain in 1559, three and half decades before Ralegh's expeditions to South America to find the City of Gold, El Dorado. (The seeds were planted in an area outside Toledo known as Los Cigarrales for its many cigarras, or cicadas.) Although Ralegh did not bring tobacco to Europe, either personally or by proxy, he probably popularized its use. A widespread legend tells of the time his manservant first saw him smoking a pipe and, alarmed that his master was on fire, fetched water to pour on him. \n The history of how potatoes were introduced to European fields appears to be even less certain than that of tobacco. One tradition credits another Elizabethan adventurer, Sir Francis Drake: a large bronze statue of him in Offenburg, Germany praises him for having done so \"in the Year of Our Lord 1586.\" However, in The History and Social Influence of the Potato (Cambridge UP, 1949, rpt. 1985), Redcliffe Salaman notes that no work of European literature mentions the potato until John Gerard's Catalogue (two editions in 1596 and 1599) and his famous Herball (1597), which devotes a chapter to the plant (77-78). Many Europeans planted potatoes in the 1600s, though they were often thought to be poisonous and fed only to animals. After saying that Ralegh brought both tobacco and potatoes to Europe, Bloom immediately corrects himself: \"That is to say he brought the poison a hundred years before another person whose name I forget brought the food.\""

Several chapters of Ulysses comment sardonically on these towering hulks entrusted with maintaining public order. In Circe, trying to curry favor with two constables, Bloom praises the \"Metropolitan police, guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body of men, as physique, in the service of our sovereign.\"",
    "expandedNote": " As Gifford observes, \"The minimum height requirement for the Dublin Metropolitan Police in 1904 was five feet nine inches, well above the stature of the ordinary Dubliner.\" Photographs from the period show burly specimens, made more imposing by their tall helmets, standing literally head and shoulders above the citizens around them. Many of them were fresh off the farm, and some city dwellers resented having their heads cracked open by these rural Jethros. \n In Calypso Bloom nurtures envy, remembering or imagining the servant girl next door being fondled by an off-duty constable. \"They like them sizeable,\" he thinks. In Lestrygonians he indulges his contempt for the troglodytic bulk of constables converging on their mess hall, some \"Bound for their troughs\" and others marching contentedly away: \"Foodheated faces, sweating helmets, patting their truncheons. After their feed with a good load of fat soup under their belts. . . . Let out to graze. Best moment to attack one in pudding time. A punch in his dinner.\" \n Two paragraphs later, Bloom reflects that these men are \"Nasty customers to tackle.\" If anyone resists arrest \"they let him have it hot and heavy in the bridewell.\" Typically, though, he thinks, \"Can't blame them after all with the job they have especially the young hornies.\" He recalls an assault by mounted police on a political demonstration that he attended in 1899, registering both the fact that he was nearly \"souped\" and the fact that the policeman chasing him fell off his mount and \"Must have cracked his skull on the cobblestones.\"\n Cyclops continues the comic attacks when a riot breaks out over the question of whether St. Patrick's birth should properly be celebrated on March 8 or March 9: \"The baby policeman, Constable MacFadden, summoned by special courier from Booterstown, quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending parties. The readywitted ninefooter's suggestion at once appealed to all and was unanimously accepted. Constable MacFadden was heartily congratulated by all the F.O.T.E.I., several of whom were bleeding profusely.\"\n By 1904 the D.M.P. had suppressed many political demonstrations, but they became especially unpopular in 1913 when they helped suppress striking laborers demonstrating for the right to unionize under the leadership of James Larkin and James Connolly. The backlash against the police brutality of those months helped redefine the powers of the constabulary."

The appearance of this highly exotic word represents one more way in which the events of the Second Boer War were still resonating in Irish consciousness in 1904.

This so-called Great Trek produced self-governed Boer republics, the Orange Free State and the South African Republic (the Transvaal), that became objects of British imperial coveting starting in the early 1870s, leading to two wars in 1880-81 and 1899-1902. In addition to driving cattle, sjamboks were effective at killing snakes, repelling attacking dogs, and administering punishment to slaves and other natives. Their use by policemen in modern South Africa has become notorious.\n Joyce's knowledge of the word suggests that he was aware of an incident during the Second Boer War involving Arthur Griffith. Griffith lived in South Africa in 1897-98, supported the Boers in their resistance to British imperial domination, and greatly admired Paul Kruger. Upon his return to Ireland in 1899 he brought a sjambok with him, and in 1900, as a leader of Dublin resistance to the now full-blown war, it figured in his political activities. In Forgotten Protest: Ireland and the Anglo-Boer War (UHF, 1989), Donal McCracken reports that one Ramsey Colles, editor of the Irish Figaro, viciously attacked Griffith's ally Maud Gonne in print on April 7. \"The next day Arthur Griffith took the sjambok he had brought home from South Africa, and visited Colles in his office. A fight ensued, the outcome of which is uncertain, both sides later claiming to have 'thrashed' the other. The final upshot of the incident was that Griffith, on refusing to undertake to a magistrate to keep the peace toward Colles, was sent to prison for two weeks\" (70). \n As hard-working and pious (albeit Calvinist) pastoralists defending their way of life—and their homes—against a modern war machine bent on handing the region's mineral resources over to industrialists like Cecil Rhodes, the Boers became even more popular in parts of rural Ireland than in Dublin. There is a clearly discernible logic, then, to Joyce's homeless peasants assaulting Bloom with a Boer truncheon. They may be headed for America rather than concentration camps, but they have a common enemy."

In 19th century sartorial language, a clock was a decorative pattern on the sides of socks, sometimes adorning only the outer ankles, sometimes going up both the outsides and insides. At the time represented in the novel they were the thing for fashionable dressers to have.",
    "expandedNote": " The OED lists one meaning of the word clock as \"An ornamental pattern in silk thread worked on the side of a stocking.\" It cites examples from as early as the 16th century. The American Heritage Dictionary defines the clock as \"An embroidered or woven decoration on the side of a stocking or sock,\" noting that it was \"Perhaps originally 'a bell-shaped ornament,' from Middle Dutch clocke, bell.\" Webster's adds that the embroidered or woven ornament goes \"up from the ankle.\"\n Although it is not quoted in Ulysses, one couplet in Those Lovely Seaside Girls calls attention to the popularity that these decorations were enjoying at the turn of the century: \"The boys observe the latest thing in socks; / They learn the time—by looking at the clocks.\" The joke, of course, is that the boys are studying not the time but the female body. With the lifting of hemlines off the floor in the later Victorian era, socks gave the male eye glimpses of thin cloth covering a woman's legs, with some of the erotic charge associated with underwear. And clocks on those socks would lead the eye in the right direction."

The OED does not record uses before the 17th century, but it seems likely that it came to Ireland with the Normans.

  "040048slimmer": {
    "note": " When Bloom thinks that the tea-colored Bath of the Nymph over his bed looks like Molly—\"Not unlike her with her hair down: slimmer\"—he echoes the comparison that Odysseus makes between Calypso and Penelope. In contests with goddesses, women do not triumph, and as the novel progresses Bloom meditates intensely on how the longing for an ideal beauty clashes with real-life, embodied desire.",
    "expandedNote": " When Calypso has received her orders from Hermes and told Odysseus that he may leave, she cannot let go of the feeling that she must be more attractive than Penelope. And Odysseus, ever the tactful tactician, agrees:\n \"And anyway, I know my body is\n better than hers is. I am taller too.\n Mortals can never rival the immortals \n in beauty.\"\n So Odysseus, with tact,\n said \"Do not be enraged at me, great goddess.\n You are quite right. I know my modest wife\n Penelope could never match your beauty.\n She is a human; you are deathless, ageless.\n But even so, I want to go back home,\n and every day I hope that day will come.\"\n All of this exchange is implicit, though mostly unvoiced, in Bloom's single thought that the nymph on his bedroom wall is \"slimmer\" than Molly. The objective picture he gets of a woman approaching middle age (as opposed to his many ardent memories of her when she was younger) do not inspire lustful worship: \"He looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large soft bubs, sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat's udder.\" He thinks in Circe that \"She put on nine pounds after weaning.\" In Penelope Molly too thinks that she has gotten a bit heavy: \"my belly is a bit too big Ill have to knock off the stout at dinner.\" And she too thinks that the nymph may outdo her a little: \"would I be like that bath of the nymph with my hair down yes only shes younger.\"\n Representations of beautiful Greek goddesses are, of course, efforts to stop time, arresting the physical blossoming of female loveliness at its young-adult peak before bellies and haunches swell and breasts sag. But Bloom thinks of them also as aspiring to transcend the limitations of the body altogether. In Lestrygonians he balances his gloomy thoughts about food with a fantasy of eating incorporeally: \"Shapely goddesses, Venus, Juno: curves the world admires. . . . Quaffing nectar at mess with gods golden dishes, all ambrosial. Not like a tanner lunch we have, boiled mutton, carrots and turnips, bottle of Allsop. Nectar imagine it drinking electricity: gods' food. Lovely forms of woman sculped Junonian. Immortal lovely. And we stuffing food in one hole and out behind: food, chyle, blood, dung, earth, food: have to feed it like stoking an engine.\"\n In Circe this longing for \"Immortal lovely\" bodies is answered when \"Out of her oakframe a nymph with hair unbound, lightly clad in teabrown artcolours, descends\" and speaks to Bloom. The Nymph acknowledges his adoration: \"You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me above your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in four places. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my shame.\" Bloom reaffirms his longing: \"Your classic curves, beautiful immortal, I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty, almost to pray.\" But she soon makes clear that human sexuality is abhorrent to her, even while she invites his gaze: \"(Loftily.) We immortals, as you saw today, have not such a place and no hair there either. We are stonecold and pure. We eat electric light. (She arches her body in lascivious crispation, placing her forefinger in her mouth.)\" In reply, Bloom rejects her purported purity as simply pre-sexual posturing: \"If there were only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices? Shy but willing like an ass pissing.\"\n Joyce's novel thus completes a circuit from physical desire to spiritual aspiration and back to physical desire. The effect is similar to that achieved in Shakespeare's famous sonnet 130, which plays on Petrarchan literary similes rather than Hellenic visual arts. The temporal element in Joyce's investigation of sexual desire also evokes Homer's poem, since nearly two decades have passed since Odysseus last saw his wife. When he says that Penelope's beauty would pale before Calypso's, he surely must be wondering how much it has declined in his absence."

  "040028smokeoftea": {
    "note": " Twice in Calypso, Bloom happily associates the smell of tea and cooking food with the warmth of Molly's bed. After being afflicted with a vision of old age on Dorset Street, he turns into Eccles Street and conjures up a vision of his bedroom to cheer himself up: \"To smell the gentle smoke of tea, fume of the pan, sizzling butter. Be near her ample bedwarmed flesh. Yes, yes.\" Having returned home, he prepares breakfast for his wife, takes it up to her, and enjoys the scene in actuality: \"The warmth of her couched body rose on the air, mingling with the fragrance of the tea she poured.\" The pleasurable associations between a woman's warm presence and the smells of warm food probably owe something to Homer's description of Calypso's cave.",
    "expandedNote": " When Hermes steps into Calypso's cave in Book 5 of the Odyssey, he finds a paradisal scene:\n Divine Kalypso, \n the mistress of the isle, was now at home. \n Upon her hearthstone a great fire blazing\n scented the farthest shores with cedar smoke\n and smoke of thyme, and singing high and low\n in her sweet voice, before her loom a-weaving,\n she passed her golden shuttle to and fro. \n A deep wood grew outside, with summer leaves\nof alder and black poplar, pungent cypress.\n Ornate birds here rested their stretched wings—\nhorned owls, falcons, cormorants—long-tongued\nbeachcombing birds, and followers of the sea.\nAround the smoothwalled cave a crooking vine\nheld purple clusters under ply of green;\n and four springs, bubbling up near one another\nshallow and clear, took channels here and there\nthrough beds of violets and tender parsley.\n Only the scented smoke in this passage directly connects it to Bloom's thoughts, but Gifford is probably right to detect an allusion, or at least an inspiration. The seductive, sensuous loveliness of Calypso's cave seems very consonant with the appeal of Bloom's domestic scene. \n It is hard to understand, though, why Gifford should associate this passage only with the second of Bloom's imaginations, the one he actually experiences in the bedroom. He links the first one (the scene he imagines in the street) with another passage in Book 1 of the Odyssey, when Athena tells Zeus of Odysseus' suffering:\n But such desire is in him \n merely to see the hearthsmoke leaping upward\n from his own island, that he longs to die.\n No doubt Gifford associates this passage with Bloom's thoughts in the street because at that moment Bloom is longing to return home. But Odysseus' longing for the hearthsmoke of Ithaca has none of the associations with smell and with female presence found in the one from Book 5. Nor do the two passages in Calypso show any marked difference from one another sufficient to associate one with Ogygia and the other with Ithaca."

  "010031snotgreen": {
    "note": " Mulligan proposes “A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen.” Given Ireland's millennial association with the color green, this must be heard as a snotty comment on the nationalistic cultural movement to which Mulligan refers: the so-called Irish Literary Revival or Irish Renaissance. The Revival was a phenomenon of the last two decades of the nineteenth century and the first two decades of the twentieth, identified with writers like William Butler Yeats, George Moore, Douglas Hyde, Lady Gregory, and John Millicent Synge.",
    "expandedNote": " During these four decades many non-governmental organizations arose not only to promote new Irish writing but also to help revive the language and culture of the past. The implicit or explicit aim of all of them was to resist the forces of assimilation that were, it was felt, slowly turning Irish men and women into “West Britons” (a term that was coined in the 1890s). Among the organizations devoted to this goal of decolonializing Ireland were: \n the Gaelic Athletic Association, founded in 1884 by Michael Cusack and Maurice Davin, which aimed to revive traditional Irish sports like hurling and Gaelic football, as well as Irish language, music, and dancing;\n the National Literary Society, founded in 1892 by Hyde, Yeats, and John O’Leary, which publicized Irish literature, folklore, and mythology; \n the Gaelic League, founded in 1893 by Hyde, which promoted the speaking of the Irish language, as well as music, dancing, games, and industry;\n the Irish Literary Theatre, founded by Yeats, Moore, Gregory, and Edward Martyn in 1899, which presented plays on nationalist subjects and later became the famous Abbey Theatre; and, less cultural than the rest,\n the Society of the Gaels, founded by Arthur Griffith in 1900 to promote Irish self-reliance and abstention from British parliamentary politics. In 1907 this group merged with two others to form Sinn Féin. The political ascendancy of Sinn Féin in 1917-22 effectively destroyed the cultural Revival.\n Joyce’s feelings about the Revival were mixed, at best. With Synge and Yeats he felt that the time for an Irish national literature had arrived, but he dismissed Yeats' overtly nationalistic Cathleen ni Houlihan as \"political claptrap\" (Stanislaus Joyce, My Brother's Keeper, 187). While a student at University College Dublin he studied Irish with Padraig Pearse (later one of the leaders of the Easter Rising), but he broke off the lessons because Pearse \"found it necessary to exalt Irish by denigrating English, and in particular denounced the word 'Thunder'—a favorite of Joyce's—as an example of verbal inadequacy\" (Ellmann, 61). All of the major writers of the Revival were \"wealthy Anglo-Irish Protestants mining Irish peasant themes,\" and Joyce considered this kind of sentimental writing \"a provincial fantasy\" (Kevin Birmingham, The Most Dangerous Book, 20). \n Joyce wrote his fictions about life in Ireland, but lived abroad while writing them and felt that his country could not assume its proper place in the community of nations by retreating into nostalgic mythologies. In the final story of Dubliners, Molly Ivors accuses Gabriel Conroy of being a West Briton and lacking sufficient interest in his own country, people, and language. Gabriel retorts that “Irish is not my language” and exclaims, “I’m sick of my own country, sick of it!” But despite his desire to escape east to the continent, he ends the story feeling that “The time had come for him to set out on his journey westward.”\n In Scylla and Charybdis Stephen feels excluded from the nationalist literary circle. He has not been invited to a gathering later in the day at George Moore’s house to which all the other literati in the library—including Mulligan, a Catholic but well-off—are planning to go. But as these men animatedly discuss the fact that “Our national epic has yet to be written,” the literary theory that Stephen has been expounding to them predicts how he will write that epic. In writing \"snotgreen,\" Joyce takes advantage of Gogarty’s characteristic sneering tone to smear the movement of which he was never a part. Beneath his scorn for the Revival's aesthetic, though, runs a deep current of anti-colonial sympathy with its aims. \n JH 2011"

    "note": " The students whom Bloom remembers protesting Joe Chamberlain in 1899 chanted a snippet from America's infectious Civil War marching song, John Brown's Body, a.k.a. the Battle Hymn of the Republic. Bloom recalls the words, \"We'll hang Joe Chamberlain on a sourapple tree.\" The students' revolutionary zeal, and Bloom's skeptical reaction to it, mirror the ambivalence that Americans felt toward John Brown.",
    "expandedNote": " Brown was a fiery abolitionist from violence-torn Kansas who led a raid on the U.S. federal armory and rifle factory at Harpers Ferry, Virginia in October 1859. Impatient with the pacifism of most abolitionists, he hoped to inspire a revolt among slaves in Virginia and North Carolina, arming them with long guns from the arsenal. The raid was briefly successful but the insurrection did not spread far. Surrounded by local farmers and captured two days later by federal troops under Lt. Colonel Robert E. Lee, Brown was quickly charged with treason (the first man in America to be so), convicted, and hanged. Republican politicians disowned his violence, but many Americans were either inspired or alarmed by his rash action. It contributed to the South's decision to secede from the Union in 1860, and it hardened the North's desire to end slavery.\n Northern soldiers, fond of singing as they marched, soon came up with a revival-style folk anthem proclaiming the righteousness of Brown's anti-slavery crusade. Countless variants of the folk version were sung, but most began along the lines of:\n John Brown's body lies a-mouldering in the grave,\n John Brown's body lies a-mouldering in the grave,\n John Brown's body lies a-mouldering in the grave,\n But his truth goes marching on.\n Glory, glory, hallelujah, \n Glory, glory, hallelujah,\n Glory, glory, hallelujah,\n His truth is marching on.\n The abolitionist writer Julia Ward Howe, who had heard soldiers singing the rousing anthem, composed her more poetically ambitious Battle Hymn in late 1861 in an effort to supply it with better words. Her famous lyrics begin, \"Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord; / He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored; / He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword: / His truth is marching on.\"\n One commonly repeated verse of the original song envisioned the President of the Confederacy, Jefferson Davis, swinging from a crabapple limb: \"They will hang Jeff Davis to a sour apple tree.\" A queue of early Joyce annotators—Hodgart and Worthington, Thornton, Bowen—interpreted this phrase as alluding to a parody of the Battle Hymn of the Republic called We'll Hang Jeff Davis. Thornton says cryptically that the parody is \"by Turner,\" and that \"Though I know such a song exists, I have not been able to find a printed copy of it.\" But it is hardly necessary to suppose a crude parody of an eloquent elaboration of a crude original, whose verses, after all, had been endlessly varied in soldiers' mouths. The Jeff Davis line, sung three times, appears in many surviving versions of John Brown's Body. The detail reproduced here comes from a piece of sheet music titled John Brown Song that bears no date but does feature a colored emblem of Indiana at the top, presumably because the lines were sung by an Indiana regiment of federal troops.\n § Many Irish-Americans fought for the Union in the Civil War, and after the conclusion of that long and brutal conflict some of them returned to the old country to join the ill-fated Fenian revolt of the late 1860s.John Brown's Body probably began circulating on Irish lips at this time, repurposed as a song about liberation from a different kind of tyranny. The song's exaltation of righteous violence represents one way in which Irish nationalism drew inspiration from American abolitionism, and the divisive attitudes that Americans held toward its central figure, the fanatical John Brown, found close parallels in Irish attitudes toward the Fenians.\n Joyce's deployment of the line about hanging the enemy's leader from a crabapple tree suggests that this ambivalence about violent renunciation was still very much in play in the early 20th century. The threatened murder of Joe Chamberlain, something that organizers of the December 1899 protest feared, comes from the mouths of young protesters whose sympathies for militant revolution ally them with John Brown. Bloom's instinctive dislike of violence and grudging respect for institutional order (\"Silly billies: mob of young cubs yelling their guts out . . . Few years' time half of them magistrates and civil servants\") allies him with the great numbers of American abolitionists who sought peaceful alternatives to civil butchery.\n Two personal communications from Ireland suggest that the sour apple verse of the song has long played a part in political rallies there. Cathal Coleman observes that the great short-story writer Frank O'Connor featured it in \"The Cornet Player Who Betrayed Ireland,\" and also in his memoir An Only Child (1961), both times in the context of early 20th century musical duels in the streets of Cork between political supporters of William O'Brien and his rival John Redmond. O'Connor's father played the big drum in a band of O'Brienites, and the story recalls how the son and his companions \"used to parade the street with tin cans and toy trumpets, singing ‘We’ll hang Johnnie Redmond on a sour apple tree.’\" At a crucial moment in the story, when the musicians in the adult band have gone off to a pub, two boys are left to guard the instruments. They take up drums, and Dickie Ryan starts to sing, \"We’ll hang William O’Brien on a sour apple tree.\" Dumbstruck, the protagonist realizes that Dickie means it, and he begins singing, \"We’ll hang Johnnie Redmond on a sour apple tree,\" until an adult \"hanger-on\" of the band barks at him to shut up. Outnumbered and astonished at the betrayal from within, the boy retreats to the pub, concealing the news of treachery from his father.\n In his memoir, O'Connor recalls that the political policy of his father's band \"was 'Conciliation and Consent', whatever that meant. The Redmond supporters we called Molly Maguires, and I have forgotten what their policy was—if they had one. Our national anthem was God Save Ireland and theirs A Nation Once Again. I was often filled with pity for the poor degraded children of the Molly Maguires, who paraded the streets with their tin cans, singing (to the tune of John Brown's Body), 'We'll hang William O'Brien on a Sour Apple Tree' . . . There were frequent riots, and during election times Father came home with a drumstick up his sleeve—a useful weapon if he was attacked by the Molly Maguires.\" Veteran readers of Ulysses will recall the pitched battles of Circe: \"Wolfe Tone against Henry Grattan, Smith O'Brien against Daniel O'Connell, Michael Davitt against Isaac Butt, Justin M'Carthy against Parnell, Arthur Griffith against John Redmond, John O'Leary against Lear O'Johnny, Lord Edward Fitzgerald against Lord Gerald Fitzedward, The O'Donoghue of the Glens against The Glens of The O'Donoghue.\" \n Vincent Altman O'Connor recalls that John Brown's truth was still marching on in these battles as recently as the 1960s. During the 1966 presidential contest, which the aged Éamon de Valera narrowly won, \"marching bands and singing were a feature of the campaign.\" Memories of Ireland's own Civil War were still raw and \"a group of Free Staters\" in Dublin North Central sang, \"We'll hang De Valera by the balls in Stephen's Green.\" O'Connor was 11 impressionable years old at the time."

She asks him, \"Is it French you are talking, sir?\" But no, it is the language of her own people: \"Irish,\" also known as \"Gaelic.\" (There are Irish and Scots versions of Gaelic.) It is, of course, massively ironic that the old woman who has been symbolically identified with Ireland should have no understanding of its native speech, which was approaching extinction, preserved only in certain remote areas known collectively as the Gaeltacht. And more ironic still that Haines is not \"from the west,\" where most of these areas were, but an Englishman come from the east to proclaim that \"we ought to speak Irish in Ireland.\"",
    "expandedNote": " Gifford notes that Mulligan’s mocking question, “Is there Gaelic on you?,” is a “west-of-Ireland, peasant colloquialism for ‘Can you speak Irish?’” When the old woman says, \"I'm ashamed I don't speak the language myself. I'm told it's a grand language by them that knows,\" Mulligan replies in his breezy way, \"Grand is no name for it . . . Wonderful entirely.\" He appears to know a little Irish (probably about as much as he knows of the \"ancient Greek\" of Homer and Xenophon), and Stephen too seems to know at least a little, judging by his patient, teacherly question to the old woman. But the populace at large, including the country people who might romantically be supposed to be in touch with traditional ways, does not share this accomplishment of young university-educated urbanites.\n Couched in the ironies of this exchange one can probably hear Joyce’s arm's-length attitude toward the turn-of-the-century Revival, which was working to revive the speaking of Irish through organizations like the Gaelic League. He presented that impatience in part 5 of A Portrait of the Artist in Stephen's refusal to be swept up in the enthusiasm for learning Irish language and mythology. But as Davin reminds Stephen there, Joyce did take a few Irish language classes. He dropped out, Ellmann notes, \"because Patrick Pearse, the instructor, found it necessary to exalt Irish by denigrating English, and in particular the word 'Thunder'—a favorite of Joyce's—as an example of verbal inadequacy\" (61). \n Joyce respected the English language as a medium which had produced so many great works of art. He took the hard-headedly realistic view that English was in Ireland to stay, and set out to become one of its greatest prose stylists. But he abhorred the linguistic colonization of his people, and he despised them for acquiescing in their colonial subjection. In an early essay called Home Rule Comet he wrote, \"For seven centuries Ireland has never been a faithful subject of England, nor on the other hand has she been faithful to herself. She almost entirely abandoned her language and accepted the language of the conquerer without being able to assimilate its culture or to adapt herself to the mentality of which that language is the vehicle.\" \n In A Portrait, Stephen talks with the dean of studies of Belvedere College about the English word “funnel” and the Irish equivalent “tundish” (unfamiliar to the dean) which Stephen has grown up with:\n The language in which we are speaking is his before it is mine. How different are the words home, Christ, ale, master, on his lips and on mine! I cannot speak or write these words without unrest of spirit. His language, so familiar and so foreign, will always be for me an acquired speech. I have not made or accepted its words. My voice holds them at bay. My soul frets in the shadow of his language.\n Later, he discovers that both words are in fact English:\n That tundish has been on my mind for a long time. I looked it up and find it English and good old blunt English too. Damn the dean of studies and his funnel! What did he come here for to teach us his own language or to learn it from us? Damn him one way or the other! \n In Ithaca, we learn that Stephen does in fact know a little Irish. He recites a snippet of ancient Irish verse and writes down several of its characters for Bloom’s benefit, and Bloom recites a bit of the Song of Solomon and writes down several Hebrew characters for Stephen’s. Both men accept the pervasiveness of English culture but respect the perpetuation of native ethnic traditions, cherishing words that are (like the Mosaic tablets in Aeolus) “graven in the language of the outlaw.” \nSome scholars have regarded Finnegans Wake as Joyce’s revenge on the English language, and the book amply supports this view. There can be no question that its exceedingly strange writing is “basically English” (116), but within the recognizable syntactic frames of this familiar language the author plants countless volatile bits mined from dozens of other languages, which explode normal English at every turn. If Wakespeak were to catch on, it would “wipe alley english spooker, multaphoniaksically spuking, off the face of the erse” (178). All those spooky English speakers, mouthing a multiphonic dialect that reduces them to puking more than speaking their language, would be wiped off the face of the earth, wiped off the erse language, wiped off the Irish arse.\n The actual course of Irish history has proved somewhat different. Since independence from Britain the government has mandated Irish language instruction in the schools, radio and television networks have developed channels where no English is spoken, and many street signs have gone bilingual. Eventually, perhaps, the island will look something like Québec."

    "note": " At the beginning of Ithaca the conversation between Stephen and Bloom appears to be going much better than it did in most of Eumaeus, but at least one of Stephen's ideas clearly strikes Bloom as, in the words of Eumaeus, \"a bit out of his sublunary depth.\" He declines to voice an opinion on what his young companion calls \"the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature,\" a phrase which strongly recalls ideas that the young Joyce had advocated in a lecture inspired by Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen. The lecture praised art which affirms human life but tells the truth about it, no matter how unflattering.",
    "expandedNote": " In January 1900, when he was only seventeen years old, Joyce delivered a lecture titled \"Drama and Life\" to the Literary and Historical Society of University College, Dublin. In this important announcement of aesthetic views that would continue, with some significant modifications, to occupy Joyce throughout his writing career, he argued that great drama was superior not only to facile stagecraft but also to mere \"literature\" for its capacity to represent enduring truths of human experience. Later, persuaded in part by his own greater talent for novelistic fiction than for stage plays, Joyce abandoned the invidious distinction between drama and literature. But he maintained his belief that fiction should represent eternal truths of the human condition.\n \"Drama and Life\" proposes that \"Human society is the embodiment of changeless laws which the whimsicalities and circumstances of men and women involve and overwrap.\" The essay presents these eternal truths metaphorically as the \"spirit\" of humankind: \"It might be said fantastically that as soon as men and women began life in the world there was above them and about them, a spirit, of which they were dimly conscious, which they would have had sojourn in their midst in deeper intimacy and for whose truth they became seekers in after times, longing to lay hands upon it. For this spirit is as the roaming air, little susceptible of change, and never left their vision, shall never leave it, till the firmament is as a scroll rolled away.\" \n The artist who seeks to capture this eternal spirit in words studies \"men and women as we meet them in the real world, not as we apprehend them in the world of faery.\" Such pitiless scrutiny is a stronger response to life, Joyce argued, than high-minded idealization of the human condition, or earnest ethical programs, or religious worship, or pursuit of beauty, or mere amusement. Such an art \"may help us to make our resting places with a greater insight and a greater foresight\" because it grounds us in the unpretty, but substantial, truth of what we are. The powerful \"Yes\" with which Molly concludes Ulysses breathes the same spirit of looking hard at what life has offered and affirming its value."

    "note": " Stephen thinks of his mother's \"shapely fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children's shirts.\" In response, Gifford notes that head lice infestation was chronic among Dublin’s poor. The John Joyce family’s periodic moves northward, from the comfortable suburbs south of Dublin into poorer and poorer neighborhoods, landed them at last in the midst of this urban plague.",
    "expandedNote": " In A Portrait of the Artist and again in Ulysses, Stephen meditates on how physical affliction produces a spiritual humbling. The final chapter of A Portrait begins with a representation of the family’s poverty during Stephen’s university years. Later, it shows how lice on his body make him doubt the value of his rarified thoughts:\n A louse crawled over the nape of his neck and, putting his thumb and forefinger deftly beneath his loose collar, he caught it. He rolled its body, tender yet brittle as a grain of rice, between thumb and finger for an instant before he let it fall from him and wondered would it live or die. There came to his mind a curious phrase from Cornelius a Lapide which said that the lice born of human sweat were not created by God with the other animals on the sixth day. But the tickling of the skin of his neck made his mind raw and red. The life of his body, illclad, illfed, louseeaten, made him close his eyelids in a sudden spasm of despair: and in the darkness he saw the brittle bright bodies of lice falling from the air and turning often as they fell. . . . His mind bred vermin. His thoughts were lice born of the sweat of sloth (254).\n Robert Burns’ poem about a louse explores similar thoughts about how the louse-infested body can humble the mind’s pretensions."

    "note": " The paternal empathy that leads Stephen to think of Sargent being as vulnerable as a snail—\"But for her the race of the world would have trampled him underfoot, a squashed boneless snail\"—may have a literary antecedent. In Thomas Hardy's The Dynasts (1904), the Chorus of Years speaks of the two armies camped before the battle of Waterloo: \"The snail draws in at the terrible tread, / But in vain; he is crushed by the felloe-rim.\"",

  "010002stairhead": {
    "note": " The novel's first action, \"Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead,\" situates the reader on the roof of a small military tower in Sandycove, seven miles from Dublin on the southeastern shores of Dublin Bay. Mulligan then stands at the stairhead and calls \"down the dark winding stairs\" of a steep stone passage that connects the tower's topside battle station to the living quarters one floor below. Finally, he moves to the raised stone platform that once held a swivel cannon but now serves as his makeshift altar: \"he came forward and mounted the round gunrest.\"",
    "expandedNote": " The British Martello towers usually mounted a single gun that swiveled around a central pivot. Part of the weight of the cannon was supported by the raised platform that Joyce calls the gunrest. Part was borne by a raised step next to the high wall that Joyce, later in Telemachus, calls a \"parapet.\" As the photograph shows, flat iron rings embedded in both structures allowed the gun to rotate freely without wearing down the granite. The gun on this tower was removed when large battleships made the structures militarily obsolete."

    "note": " The \"quiet church\" from which the sound of prayer \"streamed forth at times\" is obliquely named at the end of the sentence, when we learn that the prayers are addressed to \"Mary, star of the sea.\" Mary, Star of the Sea is a Roman Catholic church in Sandymount that at the time of the novel was located very close to the shore.",
    "expandedNote": " Stella Maris is one of many titles of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Gifford notes (376) that as Queen of Heaven she is crowned with twelve stars, according to Revelation 12:1. The association with the sea is as ancient as St. Jerome, holding both metaphorical significance (Mary is \"a beacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man,\" offering deliverance from the waves of passion and temptation) and literal (Mary, in this guise, represents hope to seafarers). Polaris, the ancient reference mark for sailors, has sometimes been called the sea-star.\n Prayers are being addressed to the Virgin late on a Thursday evening because a temperance retreat is being conducted in the church. Joyce had represented such a retreat once before, in \"Grace,\" the next to last story of Dubliners. That retreat took place in \"the Jesuit Church in Gardiner Street,\" in the north part of central Dublin. But the Sandymount church holds significance for Mr. Kernan, the alcoholic whose Catholic friends maneuver him into attending a temperance retreat, and especially for his wife: \"In her days of courtship Mr Kernan had seemed to her a not ungallant figure: and she still hurried to the chapel door whenever a wedding was reported and, seeing the bridal pair, recalled with vivid pleasure how she had passed out of the Star of the Sea Church in Sandymount, leaning on the arm of a jovial well-fed man who was dressed smartly in a frockcoat and lavender trousers and carried a silk hat gracefully balanced upon his other arm. After three weeks she had found a wife's life irksome and, later on, when she was beginning to find it unbearable, she had become a mother.\"\n Mrs. Kernan's association of the Star of the Sea with a happier time of life, before eager anticipations of marriage were supplanted by the brutal reality of living with an alcoholic, no doubt has bearing on the associations established in Nausicaa. This is the parish church of Paddy Dignam, whose home is likewise very close to the shore, and whose alcoholism has just shepherded him to an early grave and left his family confronting poverty. Gerty MacDowell, who sits on the shore listening to the ceremony in the church, has grown up in a home where her father's alcoholism sometimes led to domestic violence. She passes her days dreaming of marriage to a prince charming, but she is also well aware of men's capacity for brutality, and by modeling herself so obsessively on the Blessed Virgin she seems in part to be aspiring to a condition of perpetual chastity."

  "010081staringoutofdeath": {
    "note": " In Telemachus Stephen remembers a ghostly light playing about his mother's face as she lay dying. He thinks of it again in Proteus: \"Bridebed, childbed, bed of death, ghostcandled.\" His thoughts in Telemachus make clear that this spectacle was a source of the nightmare that has turned his mother into a vampirish ghoul: \"Her glazing eyes, staring out of death, to shake and bend my soul. On me alone. The ghostcandle to light her agony. Ghostly light on the tortured face. Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror, all prayed on their knees.\" Several phrases here strongly evoke the ghost of Hamlet's father.",
    "expandedNote": " The ghost in Hamlet glares silently on all but the young prince, singling him out from the normal run of life. It comes to inform him of the guilt of a murderous uncle and an adulterous mother, and to urge him to do something about it. To his mother, Hamlet cries, \"Look you, how pale he glares! / His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones, / Would make them capable\" (3.4.125-27). But the ghost acts, as Horatio observes, \"As if it some impartment did desire / To you alone\" (1.4.58-60). Speaking to Hamlet alone, it tells a horrifying tale (\"O, horrible, O, horrible, most horrible!\") of King Hamlet's torturous death by poison, and implies that his tortures in Purgatory are far worse (1.5). It wants revenge on the King, it wants Hamlet to step in between his mother and her sexual partner, and it weights these awful commands with the spiritual authority associated with the afterlife. Hamlet does not know whether he can trust the supernatural spirit as the true ghost of his father, but he does feel all the weight of divine commandment: \"O God!\" \"O my prophetic soul!\" \"O all you host of heaven!\" \n Oppressed by his responsibility, and by his grief and anger, the prince becomes still more alienated from others in his world. In much the same way, the ghostly appearance of Stephen’s mother singles him out from the happiness of the living, oppressing him with a divinely sanctioned command. But in Stephen's case the ghost comes to accuse him, and to command: Repent! Pray! Kneel down!"

  "010011stephendedalus": {
    "note": " Just as he put Gogarty into the novel in the fictional person of Buck Mulligan, Joyce included himself as \"Stephen Dedalus,\" an autobiographical persona whom he had introduced in his first published novel, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.",
    "expandedNote": " A Portrait finally appeared in 1916, after countless abortive drafts as Stephen Hero and serial appearances in the magazine The Egoist. It is a bildungsroman (a coming-of-age novel) or Künstlerroman (an artist's version of the same). When Joyce began writing Ulysses in 1914, he decided to continue the story of Stephen Dedalus. He wrote to Ezra Pound in 1915 that his new book \"is a continuation of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man after three years' interval blended with many of the persons of Dubliners\" (Ellmann, 383). \n After two pages representing very early childhood, A Portrait follows Stephen’s development from the time of his first entering Clongowes Wood College (which Joyce did at age 6) through his university days (Joyce attended University College Dublin from 1898 to 1902, ages 16 to 20). Although the novel follows the general outlines of some significant events in Joyce’s life, it is never specific as to dates. \n Ulysses is highly specific in most things, and on this day, June 16, 1904, Stephen is 22 years old (as Joyce himself had been). Like Joyce in the years 1902-1904, Stephen has decided to become a writer; he has introduced himself to many of the leading figures on the Dublin literary scene; he has moved to Paris to escape Irish provincialism; and, after receiving news that his mother is dying, he has returned home to a life of less glamorous poverty and very uncertain prospects. The companions with whom he conducted long peripatetic conversations at the end of A Portrait—Cranly, Lynch, Davin (themselves modeled loosely on some of Joyce’s university friends)—have been replaced by Buck Mulligan, and after this day Stephen will need a replacement for Mulligan."

  "030128stereoscope": {
    "note": " Having struggled to see the world in Bishop Berkeley's way, as colors on an essentially \"flat\" background, Stephen allows his mind to snap back into its normal perception of depth: \"Ah, see now! Falls back suddenly, frozen in stereoscope. Click does the trick.\" The stereoscope was a 19th century invention, precursor to the 3D movie glasses of today, that allowed people to resolve a pair of two-dimensional images as one more or less three-dimensional scene. First invented by Sir Charles Wheatstone in 1838, the device had gone through many iterations by 1904.",
    "expandedNote": " All such devices take advantage of a feature of binocular vision that has operated unconsciously in animal brains for millions of years: using slightly different angles of sight to determine distance to nearby objects. The fact that human eyeballs face the same way is no accident. Primates evolved jumping between tree branches, where correctly estimating distance was essential to survival. The same selective pressures helped predators gauge distances to fleeing prey animals—whose eyes typically face in opposite directions, giving them a larger total field of vision to warn of danger. As primates and predators both, human beings found it highly advantageous to have their eyes set in the same plane, where slightly different impressions on the retinas could provide depth perception across a broad field. In the illustration reproduced here, the purple section shows this broad stereoscopic field in monkey vision. The grey section shows the downside: a large blind spot, which rabbits do not suffer from. (The narrow sliver behind the rabbit should be colored grey.)\n Stereoscopes reproduced the depth-perception effect, encouraging the brain to meld two images, very slightly different from one another, into a single image that appeared to have roundness and solidity. If it seems a bit odd for Stephen to have to call upon the aid of a clever artificial device to see the world in the way that all creatures with binocular vision normally and effortlessly perceive it, the reader may reflect that Proteus began with him \"walking into eternity along Sandymount strand\" by closing his eyes, only to decide upon opening them again that the physical world was \"There all the time without you.\" His experiment with seeing reality as flat is of a piece with his metaphysical effort to pierce through the veil of appearances to the underlying truth."

  "010024stranger": {
    "note": " 750 years of English occupation of Ireland (850 in Ulster, and counting) produced a few contemptuous names for the foreign conqueror. Four that appear in Ulysses are \"Saxon,\" \"Sassenach,\" \"paleface,\" and \"stranger.\"",
    "expandedNote": " For a linguistically inventive people, no substitutes are necessary to convey dislike. Creative use is made of the ordinary name, from Mulligan’s “God, these bloody English! Bursting with money and indigestion” to the brilliantly funny revenge ditty placed in the mouth of an only slightly exaggerated Citizen in Circe:\n May the God above\n Send down a dove\n With teeth as sharp as razors\n To slit the throats \n Of the English dogs\n That hanged our Irish leaders.\n But nicknames do come in handy. In Cyclops the Citizen speaks of \"the Saxon robbers.\" In TelemachusMulligan calls Haines \"A ponderous Saxon,\" and Stephen, who is energetically resisting the Englishman's overtures of friendship, thinks, \"Horn of a bull, hoof of a horse, smile of a Saxon.\" All three, according to a common saying, are things to fear. The Scots Gaelic equivalent of Saxon, “Sassenach” (Irish Sasanaigh), is used several times, once by Mulligan (again, speaking of Haines to Stephen) and twice by the Citizen (\"the bloody brutal Sassenachs\"). For many centuries this term has been used for people born in England, and not for those who have assimilated (the latter were called gaill or foreigners in the old annals).\n The distinction between nativized Anglo-Irish settlers and more recent arrivals also figures in the slang word that Stephen uses in Telemachus for Oxford students, \"Palefaces.\" This term supposedly originated with Native Americans confronting their own English settlers, and the Irish apparently use it to reverse the current of racist hatred implicit in 18th and 19th century British stereotyping of the Irish as dark-skinned, brutish, and subhuman, like Africans and Native Americans.\n The Citizen declaims, \"We have our greater Ireland beyond the sea. They were driven out of house and home in the black 47. Their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid low by the batteringram and the Times rubbed its hands and told the whitelivered Saxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland as redskins in America.\" If the Irish can be characterized as redskins, then corresponding language can be applied to the people across the Irish Sea: \"Two carfuls of tourists passed slowly, their women sitting fore, gripping the handrests. Palefaces. Men's arms frankly round their stunted forms\" (Wandering Rocks). \n But this term also plays on the fact that Dublin has always been the city of foreign conquerors, from its founding by the Vikings to its Georgian splendor under the British. In the late Middle Ages, the Pale was the small part of Ireland that remained under the direct control of the English crown after most of the Anglo-Norman invaders forged alliances with Gaelic chieftains and intermarried. As the territory under the control of the English crown contracted to the area around Dublin, and as its perimeter was progressively ditched and fenced to hold off the natives, it came to be known metonymically by the Latin name for a stake (palus) driven into the ground to support a fence. Those outside the fence were “beyond the pale.” Those inside it—essentially, the inhabitants of greater Dublin—were “Palemen.”\n Perhaps the most interesting of these slang epithets is “stranger,” or “stranger in the house.” Stephen uses it when thinking of Haines, Deasy of the Anglo-Norman invaders in the 12th century, and Stephen again in Scylla and Charybdis when he alludes to the Countess Kathleen bemoaning “her four beautiful green fields, the stranger in her house” (i.e., the four provinces of Ireland, and the English invaders). Old Gummy Granny, Circe’s hallucinatory version of the mythical Poor Old Woman, spits, “Strangers in my house, bad manners to them!”\n In light of the novel's frequent use of this Irish expression of resentment, it is interesting that Bloom is called a stranger several times. The anti-Semitism expressed by many of Dublin’s citizens prepares the reader for this nomination. At the end of Nestor, Mr Deasy jokes that Ireland has never persecuted the Jews “Because she never let them in.” In Cyclops, the xenophobic Citizen extends his dislike of the British to the Jewish-Irish Bloom. \"We want no more strangers in our house,\" he says. Oxen of the Sun appears to perpetuate this mentality when Mulligan and the other young men in the maternity hospital think of Bloom several times as “the stranger.” Perhaps they are simply not used to seeing him in the hospital, but their use of the term may very well be xenophobic.\n All three of the book's protagonists could be called strangers: the partly Jewish Bloom, the exotically Mediterranean Molly, and the young man with an \"absurd name, an ancient Greek.\" Joyce's dislike of British rule was tempered by his awareness that Ireland has been shaped by repeated waves of conquest and assimilation. In Finnegans Wake he created another male protagonist who is regarded suspiciously as an outsider. Mr. Porter, the (possible) daytime instantiation of HCE, seems to be a Protestant, just as Bloom is Jewish, and HCE is associated repeatedly with the seafaring conquests of Danes, Norwegians, Jutes, Normans, Englishmen, and other Germanic invaders. His recurrent compulsion to defend his existence seems connected to Ireland's aggressive suspicion of outsiders: \"So this is Dyoublong? Hush! Caution! Echoland!\" \n In The Irish Ulysses (U. California Press, 1994), Maria Tymoczko argues that the ancient Irish text called The Book of Invasions \"helps to explain why the central characters in Ulysses are all outsiders though they stand as universalized representations of Dubliners, for the invasion theory of Irish history in Lebor Gabála is predicated on the notion that there are no aboriginal inhabitants of the island. In this scheme, everyone is an outsider, descended as it were from immigrants. From the perspective of Irish pseudohistory, the cultural alienation of Stephen, Bloom, and Molly mirrors the heritage of all the island's inhabitants as descendants of invaders\" (35). Greek, Jew, and Spaniard, by this reading, stand in for Nemedians, Formorians, Fir Bolg, Tuatha de Danann, Goidels-Milesians, Dane-Vikings, Anglo-Normans, English, and Scots."

Practitioners proceed from one image to the next, contemplating Christ's sufferings and spiritually aligning themselves with him through meditations and prayers. The tenth of the fourteen stations, \"Jesus is stripped of his clothes,\" echoes Matthew's gospel: “And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe” (27:28). \n Of the flippancy exhibited by Stephen no less than Mulligan, it may be observed that repetitive religious ritual employing bad art has the capacity to dull response rather than excite it."

  "030079strollingmort": {
    "note": " Imagining the cant of gypsies in Proteus, Stephen mulls some language he has encountered in Richard Head's The Canting Academy (London, 1673), a work which sought to document and translate the \"thieves' cant\" or \"rogues' cant\" of the 17th century English criminal underclass. All of the unfamiliar language in the paragraph beginning with the \"red Egyptians,\" as well as the quatrain that follows, comes from a song that Head reproduced in his book, \"The Rogue's Delight in Praise of his Strolling Mort.\" Part of the sexy quatrain returns to accost Cissy Caffrey in Circe.",
    "expandedNote": " A \"strolling mort\" is a travelling woman, i.e. a grown female gypsy. Head describes the type thus: \"Strowling-Morts are such as pretend to be Widdows, travelling about from County to County, making laces upon [st]aves, as Beggars tape, or the like; they are subtil Queans, hard-hearted, light-fingered, hypocritical and dissembling, and very dangerous to meet, if any Ruffler or Rogue be in their company\" (86). \n The phrase \"bing awast to Romeville\" means \"Go away to London.\" The word Rome (or rum, which Stephen uses later in calling the rogues' cant \"rum lingo\") means good, excellent, top-notch. Any evocation of the city of Rome appears to be coincidental, though felicitous in this novel which associates the Roman and the British empires.\n To \"wap\" is to make love, to fuck, and a \"dimber wapping dell\" is a pretty girl who is fond of that activity. (\"Buss\" is not cant at all, but a good archaic English word for \"kiss\" used occasionally by Spenser and Shakespeare.)\n Here is the text of the complete poem. Stephen recalls the entire second stanza, and parts of the final one.\n The Rogue's Delight in Praise of his Strolling Mort\n Doxy oh! Thy Glaziers shine\n As Glymmar by the Salomon,\n No Gentry Mort hath prats like thine\n No Cove e're wap'd with such a one.\n White thy fambles, red thy gan,\n And thy quarrons dainty is,\n Couch a hogshead with me than,\n In the Darkmans clip and kiss.\n What though I no Togeman wear,\n Nor Commission, Mish, or slate,\n Store of strummel wee'l have here.\n And i'th' Skipper lib in state.\n Wapping thou I know dost love,\n Else the Ruffin cly thee Mort,\n From thy stampers then remove\n Thy Drawers and let's prig in sport.\n When the Lightmans up do's call\n Margery Prater from her nest,\n And her Cackling cheats with all\n In a Boozing-Ken wee'l feast.\n There if Lour we want I'l mill\n A Gage or nip for thee a bung,\n Rum booz thou shalt booz thy fill\n And crash a Grunting cheat that's young.\n Bing awast to Rome-vile then\n O my dimber wapping Dell,\n Wee'l heave a booth and dock agen\n Then trining scape and all is well.\n Wench oh!

His novelThe English Rogue, a picaresque adventure inspired by Spanish models, sold brilliantly in five editions in the 1660s, and someone (perhaps the author, perhaps not) added three more volumes of adventures in the 1670s. The book probably influenced Defoe's Moll Flanders."

  "020026stuartcoins": {
    "note": " The tray of \"Stuart coins\" that Stephen sees on the schoolmaster's sideboard in Nestor are relics of a sorry period in Ireland's history: its invasion in 1688 by King James II of England, who was seeking a Catholic base of power against the Protestant King William who had deposed him. In 1689-90, after securing the allegiance of many of the Irish, James issued a series of new coins that were minted from base metals like copper and brass and debased the existing Irish currency.",
    "expandedNote": " This was not the usual invasion. James ascended the English throne on the death of his brother Charles II in 1685, but quickly excited opposition because he was openly Catholic and employed the rhetoric of absolute monarchy, confirming two longstanding suspicions about the Stuarts. When he produced a Catholic heir, powerful Protestant opponents reacted by encouraging his nephew and son-in-law William of Orange to raise an army and invade England from the Low Countries. James fled England, an action which was interpreted as abdication (and euphemized as \"The Glorious Revolution\"), and William III was installed as King, ruling jointly with his wife, James' daughter Mary. \n From France, where he had first taken refuge, James landed an army in Ireland. He was welcomed by the Catholics who had lost land and power as a result of the long Confederate Wars of the 1640s and Oliver Cromwell's conquest in 1649-53. But when William brought his own army to Ireland and defeated James' forces at the Battle of the Boyne (near Drogheda) in 1690, their downfall became total. Catholics who had supported James fled the country, becoming the first \"wild geese.\" The ruling class which eventually became known as the Protestant Ascendancy took shape. And Parliament passed a series of harsh new penal laws in the 1690s and early 1700s to suppress the Catholic population. Edmund Burke remarked that these laws constituted \"a machine of wise and elaborate contrivance, as well fitted for the oppression, impoverishment and degradation of a people, and the debasement in them of human nature itself, as ever proceeded from the perverted ingenuity of man.\"\n James' coinage added its own modicum of disaster to this general catastrophe, because it debased the Irish currency by inflating the money supply. Excepting some gold and silver proof strikes, the coins contained no intrinsic value; they are called \"gunmoney,\" because much of the metal in them came from melting down old brass cannons. But, as Gifford observes, they have value as collectors' items: \"The coins, though initially as worthless as the Stuart attempt to use Ireland (a bog) as a base from which to retake England, are, of course, rare.\" Presumably Deasy owns them for their numismatic value, not because they celebrate the Irish Catholic cause. And presumably they exist in this chapter to inspire both Stephen's contempt for the \"base\" nature of money and his despair about the sorry course of Irish history.\n [2014] Thornton quotes from Joyce's \"Alphabetical Notebook\": \"Irish wits follow in the footsteps of King James the Second who struck off base money for Ireland which the hoofs of cattle have trampled into her soil.\" He notes the relevance of this sentence to Deasy's concern with money and cattle. He does not note that it may also account for the reference to coins being fished from bogs."

  "030054swunglourdily": {
    "note": " Stephen sees two middle-aged, unfashionable women coming down the steps to the sand, and the narrative adopts his perspective and thoughts: \"Number one swung lourdily her midwife's bag, the other's gamp poked in the beach.\" Lourdily seems to mean simply \"heavily\" (from lourd in French, a language that Stephen drops into throughout Proteus). And \"gamp\" appears to mean \"umbrella,\" because of Mrs. Gamp, the umbrella-carrying nurse in Dickens' Martin Chuzzlewit.",
    "expandedNote": " Dickens tells us that Mrs. Gamp's sign-board proclaimed her \"Midwife,\" and that at her first appearance in the novel she has just been up all night helping another \"professional lady\" deliver a child. Starting from this literary reference point, Stephen conjures up a little dramatic vignette, as he began to do in Telemachus. In his thoughts, the umbrella and the midwife's bag (seen together in Kyd's illustration) get distributed between the two women, and the bag contains \"A misbirth with a trailing navelcord.\"\n It seems all but certain that Stephen does not know these two women, does not know that one is a midwife or that one is the widow of \"the late Patk MacCabe, deeply lamented,\" does not know that she lives on \"Bride Street\" in \"the liberties.\" His thoughts here show the hand of the artist-to-be, and the figure of the two women out on a jaunt together will return at the end of Aeolus, transformed into a short story. By the time he tells his \"parable of the plums\" there, Stephen has found a name for the second woman, \"Anne Kearns,\" to go with \"Florence MacCabe.\" He has changed them into virgins (\"vestals\"), given them ages (50 and 53), and changed their place of residence (from Bride Street to Fumbally's Lane, \"Off Blackpitts\").\n The two women return at the end of Wandering Rocks, and now Joyce's narrative trumps Stephen's. The bag, it seems, had nothing to do with midwifery and everything to do with clam-digging. The tragic grotesquerie of Stephen's dead-baby fantasy gives way to comic absurdity, as eleven little mollusks roll over to gape at the Lord Mayor: \"two sanded women halted themselves, an umbrella and a bag in which eleven cockles rolled to view with wonder the lord mayor and lady mayoress without his golden chain.\""

    "note": " The Irish playwright John Millicent Synge does not walk the pages of Ulysses, but as a talented and recently accomplished Irish writer he is much on the minds of the literati in Scylla and Charybdis. It is fitting that a chapter concerned with drama should mention the most promising dramaturge on Dublin's nascent theatrical scene. Synge also seems to serve as a kind of foil to Stephen Dedalus, who is equally talented but younger and not yet accomplished. Stephen has some history with Synge, and several details in the chapter suggest that he feels envious rivalry, as Joyce did at the same age.",
    "expandedNote": " Born to suburban Dublin parents in 1871, eleven years before Joyce, Synge played the violin and studied music, and after graduating from Trinity College in 1892 he went to Germany to continue those studies. But he decided to become a writer instead and moved to Paris to study literature and languages at the Sorbonne. There, William Butler Yeats advised him to return to his own country and visit the Aran islands, where traditional Irish language and ways of life might give him worthy subject matter. Synge took the advice, living in the islands each year from 1897 to 1902 for months at a time. He became fluent in Gaelic, listened carefully to the distinctive rhythms of local speech, collected folklore, and heard ancient pagan beliefs persisting in modern Catholic mouths. Raised Protestant himself, Synge had lost his faith after reading Darwin at the age of 14. He found a new kind of faith in the islands' rural inhabitants, who led hard lives and endured them with dignity.\n In 1901 Synge wrote a nonfiction book titled The Aran Islands (published in 1907) and by 1902 he was writing plays. He finished two one-act dramas in 1903: In the Shadow of the Glen and the masterful Riders to the Sea. Both were performed at Molesworth Hall in Dublin,Shadow in 1903 and Riders in 1904. Buck Mulligan, who appears to have attended a performance of Riders,gaily imitates its speeches with only a bit of his usual mockery in Scylla and Charybdis. Synge produced several longer plays in the next few years: The Well of the Saints (1905), The Playboy of the Western World (1907), and The Tinker's Wedding (1909). All of his plays roused objections from Irish nationalists and conservative Catholics, and the opening performance of Playboy at the Abbey Theatre in January 1907 sparked a riot over its supposed indecency. Two years later, Synge lay dying from the Hodgkin's lymphoma that had afflicted him since 1897. He left behind a manuscript, Deirdre of the Sorrows, that some contemporaries saw as an unfinished masterpiece.\n When Russell stands up to leave the library office, briefly interrupting the Shakespeare talk, Stephen listens to the others chatting: \"Synge has promised me an article for Dana too. Are we going to be read? I feel we are. The Gaelic league wants something in Irish.\" Synge did not write in Irish—he was afraid that the language was doomed to extinction—but these sentences suggest that his first plays had raised high hopes for Irish literature, and perhaps also for the dramatic value of Hiberno-English speech. Several pages later, Mulligan enters the office and, asked if he has any thoughts on Shakespeare, replies, \"I seem to know the name.\" Lighting up, he says, ah sure, \"The chap that writes like Synge.\" \n One might suspect some mockery here, and one would be correct, but the joke is really on Yeats, who had given some over-the-top praise to Synge's work. Oliver St. John Gogarty recalls this reverence in As I Was Going Down Sackville Street: \"One of the first meetings of the Irish Theatre, or rather of those who were about to produce Irish drama, took place in the Nassau Hotel. Maud Gonne sat on the opposite side of the table. Synge was at one end by Lady Gregory. Padraic Colum sat next to me. Suddenly Yeats exclaimed in admiration of a scene he was reading: / 'Æschylus!' / 'Who does he mean?' Colum whispered, amazed. / 'Synge, who is like Æschylus'. / 'But who is Æschylus?' / The man who is like Synge!'\" (299-300). \n As the young James Joyce prepared to move to Paris in January 1903, Lady Gregory wrote to Synge there asking him to help Joyce find cheap rooms in the city. Synge assisted in this and other ways, advising Joyce about how to deal with editors and with starvation. According to Ellmann, \"he warned Joyce not to fast too long; his own protracted spells of hunger had obliged him, he said, to undergo a £30 operation\" (124). The two brilliant artists inevitably were drawn to one another, and inevitably they clashed. Ellmann notes that Joyce thought Synge \"a great lump of a man who could not be argued with, but since Joyce was equally doctrinaire they in fact argued a great deal. Sometimes the dispute was over nothing,\" as when Synge called Joyce bourgeois for proposing that they go visit the carnival. Other arguments were more substantive, as when Joyce read Riders to the Sea and responded harshly. Unlike Yeats who thought of Aeschylus, Joyce said that Riders was \"a tragic poem, not a drama\": men drowning in the sea and families being ruined were tragic enough, but a little one-act mood piece could not satisfy Aristotelian standards. Ellmann concludes his summary by observing that \"They parted amicably on March 13, respecting and disdaining each other\" (125). \n These clashes, and his inability to form a lasting friendship with Synge, are recalled in Scylla and Charybdis when Stephen thinks of the \"Harsh gargoyle face that warred against me over our mess of hash of lights in rue Saint-André-des-Arts.\" Imagining their meetings as comparable to the mythical meeting of Oisin and St. Patrick, the one representing the old heroic age and the other announcing the new Christian order, Stephen thinks, \"His image, wandering, he met. I mine.\" Here he draws on his Shakespeare theorizing, which holds that we solipsistically walk through the world encountering versions of ourselves, and that \"His own image to a man with that queer thing genius is the standard of all experience, material and moral. Such an appeal will touch him. The images of other males of his blood will repel him. He will see in them grotesque attempts of nature to foretell or repeat himself.\" Both he and Synge, Stephen fancies, experienced this repulsion in Paris. There was no room for the other in either man's universe.\n But Joyce was not half so dismissive of Riders to the Sea as his youthful rivalry drove him to suggest. In 1909 he translated the play into Italian and tried to have it produced in Trieste. Unlike Gabriel Conroy, whom he represents in The Dead as being unwilling to visit the Aran islands, he did go there with Nora in 1912 and wrote two articles about his experience for Piccolo della Sera. Ellmann observes that he \"came round to sharing Ireland's primitivism. He depicted Aran with the affection of a tourist who has read Synge, noted the peculiarities in the islanders' dialect, and described curious local customs and history\" (325). In 1918 he \"persuaded Nora to play a minor role\" in a production of Riders to the Sea; \"She had never acted before and was timid at first, but her rich contralto voice, with its strong Galway accent, gradually acquired confidence. Joyce trained the other actors to imitate her speech and the Aran speech rhythms\" (440). In Scylla and Charybdis, Mulligan is given the job of imitating the Aran speech rhythms yet once more.\n Mulligan implies that he and Stephen have had interactions with Synge in Dublin, though his remarks amount to little more than mockery of the playwright's eccentricities: \"— The tramper Synge is looking for you, he said, to murder you. He heard you pissed on his halldoor in Glasthule. He's out in pampooties to murder you. / — Me! Stephen exclaimed. That was your contribution to literature.\" Glasthule is a part of Kingstown where Synge was living in the summer of 1904. He used the word \"trampers\" in The Tinker's Wedding and elsewhere as a name for tinkers, and by extension for his own itinerant ways. \"Pampooties\" are shoes made of undressed cowhide that were worn by Aran islanders at the time. \"The implication,\" Gifford notes, \"is that Synge has gone native.\" (The OED cites an 1884 folklore journal's theory that this local word was an import, brought to Aran long ago by \"an East Indian ship-captain\" who settled there.) Near the end of Scylla and Charybdis one final element of personal mythology comes up: \"Synge has left off wearing black to be like nature. Only crows, priests and English coal are black.\" The third photograph here shows the severe effect that this sartorial choice achieved.\n One other detail reflects Joyce's involvement with Synge, though the chapter does not make the connection explicit. Ellmann records that for a time in 1904 Joyce socialized with the actors of the National Theatre Society, who rehearsed \"in a makeshift theater, really a large storehouse behind a grocery shop in Camden Street,\" accessed by a long dimly lit hallway. He had been there on June 10 \"when Synge announced to the society that he had a new play ready for them, The Well of the Saints. Synge's productivity probably encouraged Joyce to demonstrate splenetically his continued contempt for the Irish theater, for he arrived so drunk on June 20 that he collapsed in the passageway.\" One of the actresses came out into the hallway with her mother and stumbled over the body. She alerted the company's directors, Frank and William Fay, who evicted the loudly protesting Joyce and locked him out. Joyce soon retaliated with a short poem, whose second stanza reads:\n But I angered those brothers, the Fays,\n Whose ways are conventional ways,\n For I lay in my urine\n While ladies so pure in\n White petticoats ravished my gaze. (160-61)\n In Scylla and Charybdis this account enters only slightly changed in Mulligan's recollection: \"— O, the night in the Camden hall when the daughters of Erin had to lift their skirts to step over you as you lay in your mulberrycoloured, multicoloured, multitudinous vomit! / — The most innocent son of Erin, Stephen said, for whom they ever lifted them.\""

    "note": " Walking with eyes closed and ashplant hanging \"by my side,\" Stephen thinks, \"Tap with it: they do.\" Who are \"they\"? The book will retrospectively confirm a common-sense answer to the question: blind people tap the ground with sticks to see where they are going.",
    "expandedNote": " In Lestrygonians Bloom crosses paths with a \"blind stripling\" who stands \"tapping the curbstone with his slender cane.\" (The stripling will reappear in Sirens, where the \"tap\" sound of his wand becomes a musical motif in the chapter's play of sounds.) After he has helped the unfortunate young man cross the street, Bloom tries to imagine how blind people sense presences in space, how they manage to walk a straight line, how they compensate for their disability, and how their other senses may be augmented. Soon he is touching various parts of his body to see what touch can do independent of sight, and thinking, \"Want to try in the dark to see.\" Stephen's tapping with his eyes closed seems to connect with Bloom's efforts to imagine what it is like to be blind—one of many esoteric correspondences between the two men in the novel. \n § Declan Kiberd reads another kind of significance into \"Tap with it: they do.\" The ancient Irish bards, he notes, also tapped with sticks: \"Once upon a time in ancient Ireland the bard was a powerful figure, standing second only to the chieftain. But those days are long gone, and Stephen is utterly marginal in the colonial society which has since emerged. Yet he carries an ashplant walking cane to evoke memories of those filí who carried a rod as a symbol of their vatic power. Those filí were often blind or short-sighted, so the rod helped them to feel their way forward, as the stick assists Stephen\" (Ulysses and Us, 32). \n Kiberd observes that Mulligan has called Stephen a bard several times in the book's first chapter, and Stephen recalls these mocking invocations at the end of \"Nestor\": \"Mulligan will dub me a new name: the bullockbefriending bard.\" He also supports his contention that Stephen is thinking of the ancient bards by observing that when Joyce carried his cane through the streets of Paris, matching the dress of fashionably decadent flâneurs, he insisted on the Irishness of his ashplant: \"'It was a symbol of his country,' said Jacques Mercanton, 'that he always carried with him on the roads of the world'\" (32-33). \n To this argument one might object that Stephen thinks, \"Tap with it. They do,\" not \"They did.\" But the ancient Irish bards' powers of prophecy would cohere with the Roman powers of divination that he summons later in Proteus when he thinks of an alter-self sitting on another planet \"with his augur's rod of ash.\""

  "010000telemachus": {
    "note": " The eighteen chapters of Ulysses have no numbers or titles. Readers usually refer to them by the handles that Joyce supplied in his two schemas: names of corresponding \"episodes\" in the Odyssey. In addition to offering brief introductions to the chapters, then, the headnotes on this website describe how they recast certain elements of Homer's story. Episode 1, \"Telemachus,\" is set in a decommissioned military tower on the rocky coast of Sandycove, seven miles southeast of central Dublin, and it echoes the situation found in the palace on Ithaca at the beginning of the ancient epic. The chapter begins a little after 8:00 AM on 16 June 1904, and concludes at 8:45.",
    "expandedNote": " Many readers have been inclined to dismiss the Homeric correspondences as overblown distractions, and/or to limit Joyce's interest in the Odyssey to his childhood encounter with Charles Lamb's The Adventures of Ulysses, but there is abundant evidence to suggest that Joyce's novel is engaged in a serious—though hardly straightforward—intertextual dialogue with Homer's poem. Ulysses evokes the Odyssey opportunistically, in ways that vary dramatically from chapter to chapter. The echoes are quirky, unsystematic, imaginative, and often funny, but they also provoke thought about the commonalities in ancient and modern human life. Sometimes they are so exceedingly subtle that a century's worth of readings have failed to appreciate their extensiveness. \n In all print versions of Ulysses, the first three chapters are preceded by a Roman numeral I, signifying that they constitute a distinct section. A Roman II introduces chapters 4-15, while chapters 16-18 constitute section III. Like the first four books of Homer's poem, often called the Telemacheia or Telemachiad, the first three chapters of Ulysses belong to a young man (Telemachus is 20, Stephen 22) struggling to grow into adult confidence and agency. \n Joyce's first novel, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, was a bildungsroman, and he continued the story of Stephen Dedalus into Ulysses. But the mature novel shows Stephen far removed from the hopeful sense of purpose that he felt at the end of A Portrait, where he intended to fly by the nets flung at the soul, escape to Paris, and forge the uncreated conscience of his race. In this book Stephen is back in Ireland, immersed again in the misery of his family, living with an Englishman in a tower built by the British empire, tormented by Catholic guilt, overshadowed by a superficially more brilliant and successful companion, hungering for love, drinking too much, and writing only a few impressionistic and derivative lines of verse.\n Homer's poem offered a narrative analogue that could give structure to the amorphous mass of Stephen's suffering and striving. Joyce's Telemachiad, however, is anything but a simple rewriting of Homer's. It is instructive to consider what he did not include, or included only in glancing and ironic ways. Homer's Telemachus is holding down the fort for his father—or wishing that he could. The action is centered on Ithaca, whose palace has been overrun by insolent young men seeking to marry Odysseus' widow. Joyce does not really map this story onto Stephen's, though he echoes it in many ways. \n Mulligan's not paying the rent for the tower, and his determination to drink away the fruits of Stephen's teaching labors, are almost certainly meant to evoke the suitors' riotous consumption of the palace's food and drink. Likewise, Mulligan's contemptuous and contemptible treatment of his aunt's servant (he steals a mirror from her, and jokes about seducing her) recalls the suitors' corruption of the palace's female servants. The old woman who comes to deliver the milk makes Stephen think that she may be a \"messenger\" or a goddess in disguise, recalling Athena's disguised embassy to Telemachus.\n Least obviously but most importantly, the chapter is stuffed with suggestions of violence. Kinch the knife-blade, Mulligan's razor and surgical lancet, Haines' revolver, a breakfast knife that hews and lunges and impales, references to military barracks and expeditions and defenses, emotional \"gaping wounds,\" thoughts of castration, bodies \"cut up into tripes in the dissecting room,\" ghouls that chew on corpses: all these details recreate the atmosphere of the palace in Ithaca, where 108 young men assault Odysseus' patrimony, threaten the life of his son, and invite the violent destruction that both king and prince rain down upon them at the end of the epic.\n But Joyce's first chapter contains no patrimonial homestead, and the allusions suggesting that Stephen might need to protect his wealth, journey in search of his father, and violently defend his home from invaders prove to be red herrings. He may have \"paid the rent\" on one occasion, but it is clear that he is living in Mulligan's home rather than the other way around, and that Mulligan is supporting him with clothes and money. Violent antipathy may lurk just beneath the surface of the two men's relationship, but Joyce's novel is a deeply pacifist work, and when personal experience gave him material for Stephen to be threatened with bodily injury in the tower, he toned it down. The old milkwoman is no Athena; she does not come to advise Stephen, and he scorns \"to beg her favour.\" The tower lies close to the water, but the hydrophobic Stephen will not be launching a ship; it is Mulligan who plunges into the sea at the chapter's end. \n What does survive Joyce's transformations intact is Homer's psychological portrait of a young hero in the making. Mulligan presents himself as Stephen's friend, benefactor, and mentor, but Stephen sees him as a disrespectful, malicious \"Usurper\" who would, as he says much later in Circe, \"Break my spirit.\" Symbolically, this identifies Mulligan with the chief suitor, Antinous, whose name means \"anti-mind.\" Telemachus' need to assert adult male independence of his mother (he, not she, is the patriarchal heir and presumptive master of the household) takes the form of Stephen's need to overcome the religious guilt associated with his mother's dying. Telemachus' physical search for the father who can help him slaughter his enemies becomes Stephen's need to realize an idea of spiritual paternity that he sees as synonymous with authorship. The book will steer him toward an actual man, Leopold Bloom, who may somehow give Stephen an image of this spiritual ideal, but it will not join the two men in any practical sense comparable to what happens in the Odyssey.\n Rather than narrating an existential threat to a kingdom, Joyce's chapter represents a crisis in the psychological development of an individual. Stephen has no Ithaca to restore, but he does need to find a home, both in the literal sense that when he walks away at the end of the chapter he is becoming homeless, and in the larger sense that he needs the familial love and stability that Bloom has found. He needs an artistic purpose, if he is not to reenact the futility of his father's life. He needs a personal strength equal to the forces of British colonial subjection, Catholic puritanical self-denial, Irish political violence, and Dublin's alcoholic fatalism. These desperate needs of a spectacularly gifted young man make Stephen a Telemachus.\n Both of Joyce's schemas indicate that Telemachus takes place between the hours of 8 and 9 AM. The first of these times is confirmed, near the beginning of the chapter, by the 8:15 departure of the mailboat from Kingstown harbor, and the second at the chapter's end by the 8:45 sounding of bells from some Kingstown tower."

    "note": " Terenure is a residential suburb about two miles SW of central Dublin. When track was laid for tramlines in the early 1870s it was the first locale to receive service. Terenure has some considerable significance in the novel as the location of Mat Dillon's house.",
    "expandedNote": " In Sirens, Bloom thinks of meeting Marion Tweedy at that house in 1887: \"First night when first I saw her at Mat Dillon's in Terenure. Yellow, black lace she wore. Musical chairs. We two the last. Fate. After her.

Gifford notes that \"By 1904 Roundtown had been renamed Terenure\" (573). Bloom uses the contemporary name when he thinks of meeting his future wife. The narrative uses the name that was in force at the time of the meeting."

  "010035thalatta": {
    "note": " “Thalatta! Thalatta!\" means \"The sea! The sea!” Xenophon's Anabasis, written in the first decades of the 4th century BC, records this cry of a Greek army upon seeing the Black Sea. It expressed their relief and exultation at escaping near-certain death.",
    "expandedNote": " The word anabasis refers to a military expedition, literally “a march up from the coast” or “a march up country.” Xenophon took part in such an expedition in 401, as one of 10,000 Greek mercenaries who, along with a much greater number of Persians, agreed to follow Cyrus the Younger from the Aegean Sea up into Ionia (western Turkey today) to attack a Persian tributary who ruled Ionia. The real target of Cyrus’ massive army, however, was his older brother Artaxerxes II, the emperor of Persia. Near Tarsus (in what is now south central Turkey), the Greek soldiers discovered this appalling deception and refused to go further east, but were convinced to do so by a Spartan general named Clearchus. After surviving battle with Artaxerxes’ army in what is now the heart of Iraq, Clearchus was invited to a peace conference by Artaxerxes, who betrayed and murdered him. Far from the sea and surrounded by hostile forces, the Ten Thousand elected new leaders (Xenophon one of them) and fought their way out of Persia, north to the Black Sea. From there they made their way home via the Bosporus. \n Added to the Homeric references, the evocation of this heroic feat deepens our impression that the events of Ulysses are somehow recapitulating or echoing the world of ancient Greece. And they foreground one particular aspect of that world: armed conflict. Mulligan speaks the triumphant words of Xenophon, and his relation to Stephen makes him Antinous, the leader of the suitors whom Telemachus must outwit and kill. Along with the knives that figure often in this episode, these stories seem to predict an archaic narrative of violent struggle. But Ulysses will complicate these expectations. In the following episode, Nestor, the Homeric analogues begin to function less straightforwardly, assuming parodic forms. The book as a whole will undermine notions of heroism based on strength and aggression."

    "note": " New Style? \"It is not why therefore we shall wonder if, as the best historians relate...had been begun she felt\": some commentators have heard in these two paragraphs a stylistic pastiche distinct from the one displayed in the previous paragraph. But the turgid Latinate prose is similar in many ways, and the content, while different, feels connected quasi-logically to the previous argument: because Ireland has long valued procreation (point one), \"therefore\" it has a venerable tradition of practicing medicine and building hospitals such as the one to which Mrs. Purefoy has come (point two). Even if Joyce did not intend to create a new style in these paragraphs, and there is some internal evidence to suggest that he did, it does seem that he is shifting the focus from a vaguely ancient prehistory to a specifically Irish medieval history.",
    "expandedNote": " Some phrases in these new paragraphs sound almost idiomatically modern: \"as the best historians relate\"; \"Not to speak of hostels, leperyards, sweating chambers, plaguegraves\"; \"Certainly in every public work\"; \"therefore a plan was by them adopted\"; \"not merely in being seen but also even in being related.\" At other times the language is even more syntactically contorted than that of the preceding paragraph. The baffling opening clause is followed by many others, such as \"it is difficult in being said which the discrepant opinions of subsequent inquirers are not up to the present congrued to render manifest\"; \"prosperity at all not to can be and as they had received eternity gods mortals generation to befit them her beholding\"; \"parturient in vehicle thereward carrying desire immense among all one another\"; \"she by them suddenly to be about to be cherished had been begun she felt.\"\n One has the sense, reading these paragraphs after the preceding one, of taking an occasional, hesitant step forward, only to be drawn back even more intractably into linguistic muck. Perhaps, then, they are best understood as a continuation of the first style's deliberately baffling Latinate medium, as Declan Kiberd seems to do by not signaling the start of a new section. The English prose continues to sound like an ineptly literal translation of Latin, and the opaque Latinate vocabulary persists: \"prosperity\" is somehow still obscurely important; mothers are \"proliferent\" rather than pregnant or breeding or child-bearing; they come to the hospital \"parturient\" rather than in labor; healthcare providers seek to minimize \"all accident possibility\" rather than foreseeable complications; hospitals waive \"emolument\" rather than payment.\n But several details in the first paragraph create a sense that we may be moving forward into a recognizably historical era and a particular geographical place. The \"best historians\" are not identified any more than were Sallust and Tacitus in the preceding paragaph, but now it is said that they wrote about practices \"among the Celts.\" The \"art of medicine\" is mentioned not just as something characteristic of \"a nation\" or \"the nation,\" as in the preceding paragraph, but as practiced by the Irish people's \"greatest doctors, the O'Shiels, the O'Hickeys, the O'Lees,\" families of hereditary physicians who served noble families of ancient Ireland. Records of their practices go back to Irish and English historical chronicles and medical treatises of the 15th, 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries, and they began practicing many centuries earlier still. \n Nearly 100 medieval manuscripts contain medical texts in Irish. The website of the Royal Irish Academy, which holds a large number of these manuscripts, observes that the medical texts consist \"mainly of translations or adaptations of continental Latin treatises into early modern Irish. The Irish practitioners were unusual in translating the texts into the vernacular rather than working from the Latin as was the norm elsewhere in Europe. Many of these Latin versions had been translated from Greek or Arabic by early practitioners in France and Italy. The compilations were made for practical purposes—for the use of doctors in the course of their working lives.\" \n Although it seems doubtful that Joyce would have had the facility in early modern Irish to delve very deeply into such texts, it is tempting to suppose that they might have influenced not only his understanding of medieval Irish medicine but also the style in which he presented it. Translations of translations, produced for purely practical purposes, without pretensions to literary elegance—such mongrel documents might very well resemble the two horrible paragraphs that Joyce set down. If scholars eventually identify and describe some plausible examples, the find would support, and refine, Gifford's view that these two paragraphs (unlike the preceding one, inspired, he supposes, by Sallust and Tacitus) were written \"After the style of medieval Latin prose chronicles, again with the effect of a literal translation that does not Anglicize word usage and syntax.\" \n Of course, such a discovery would complicate even further Joyce's stated intention of imitating the chronological development of English prose. Latin was the lingua franca of medieval and early modern Europe, and for centuries some clerical and historical English writers preferred that medium to the Anglo-Saxon or Anglo-Norman English spoken in the streets, so creating an Anglicized equivalent of their Latin might arguably have some relevance to the project. But using English to imitate the effect of Celts translating Latin texts into Irish? Such a digression would be simply bizarre. It would not, however, necessarily be out of keeping with the methods of Oxen of the Sun."

  "140029thecastle": {
    "note": " New Style. \"And whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened...Thanked be Almighty God\": in these three paragraphs things get simpler and more fun forOxen of the Sun's beleaguered readers. The blur of obscure, shifting voices in the chapter's opening pages here gives way to a consistent style indebted to a single medieval text, the purported Travels of a man called Sir John Mandeville who aped Marco Polo's Travels by recounting the strange sights he encountered in Turkey, Persia, Mesopotamia, India, China, Armenia, Georgia, Ethiopia, Egypt, and the Levant. After first appearing in the middle of the 14th century, these fantastic and compelling tales were translated into various languages, and their popularity endured for a long time: Columbus was avidly reading them a century later, as were Frobisher and other Elizabethans a century after that, and Samuel Johnson two centuries later still. In Joyce's hands, their style transforms a roomful of young men sitting around a table with beers and some poor eats into a gallery of exotic wonders.",
    "expandedNote": "Though \"Mandeville\" claimed to be an English knight, there is no historical record of such a man, and the Travels were probably not composed in English: the earliest surviving text is in French, and some scholars have inferred that an Anglo-Norman original preceded it. The Middle English version, however, became one of the foundations of English prose, with other late 14th century works by Geoffrey Chaucer and John Wycliffe. Joyce could have encountered it both in George Saintsbury's masterful study of English Prose Rhythm and in William Peacock's English Prose from Mandeville to Ruskin (London, 1903), an anthology chosen \"to illustrate the development of English prose\" (v). Both Saintsbury and Peacock emphasize the historical importance of the stories' prose, written at a time when the English language was beginning to assume its modern shape. \n The style is highly engaging but not highly sophisticated. Saintsbury observes that \"On the whole, one may say that Sir John's style is that of the better but simpler class of verse romance—dismetred, freed from rhyme, and from the expletives which were the curse of rhymed verse romance itself; but arranged for the most part in very short sentences, introduced (exactly like those of a child telling stories) by 'And.' I open a page of Halliwell's edition absolutely at random: the sentences are not quite so short as they are sometimes, but there are eleven of them in thirty-three lines of large and widely-spaced print; ten of which begin with 'and,' and the eleventh with 'also.' Every now and then, especially when he comes to the choice things—the 'Lady of the Land,' the 'Watching of the Sparhawk,' the 'Origin of Roses,' the 'Valley of the Devil's Head'—he sometimes expands his sentences and makes them slightly more periodic, but they are still rather cumulative than anything more\" (64). \n Joyce reproduces this naive effect exactly. Of the nineteen sentences before his concluding \"Thanked be Almighty God,\" seventeen begin with \"And,\" one with \"Also,\" and one with \"But.\" The longer sentences are produced either by tacking on additional compounding conjunctions (\"and there nighed them,\" \"and he said,\" \"and it was upheld,\" \"but they durst not move\") or by using conjunctions to initiate simple explanatory clauses (\"sithen it had happed,\" \"for he was sore wounded,\" \"for he was a man of cautels,\" \"though she trowed well,\" \"for he never drank\"). These breathlessly strung conjunctions, like the Mandevillean ones that Saintsbury likened to a young child's story-telling, are perfectly suited to the air of rapturous wonder in which Joyce describes the hospital's common-room: there was a table held up by enchanted dwarves, and it had shining swords and knives on it, and also magical drinking vessels and fishes without heads, and people in the castle made spirits produce bubbles and they made serpents wind themselves around poles!\n Saintsbury quotes from one of the four \"choice things\" he found in the Travels, and Peacock reproduces that story along with two others. It tells of a woman who has taken the shape of a huge dragon, \"And they of the Isles call her Lady of the Land.And she lieth in an old castle, in a cave, and sheweth twice or thrice in the year. And she doth no harm to no man, but if men do her harm. And she was thus changed and transformed, from a fair damsel, into likeness of a dragon, by a goddess that was cleped Diana. And men say, that she shall so endure in that form of a dragon, unto the time that a knight come, that is so hardy, that dare come to her and kiss her on the mouth; and then shall she turn again to her own kind, and be a woman again.\" The story tells how several different knights failed to surmount this challenge and died.\n Janusko notes that \"Joyce does not seem to have copied anything from\" this story onto his notesheets (60). It may nonetheless have inspired him to imagine the common-room as an ominous \"castle\" which Bloom tries to avoid entering, and also to recast his bee-sting as a spear-wound received from \"a horrible and dreadful dragon.\" In Janusko's view, Dixon's invitation to enter the common-room instead echoes the story \"Of a Rich Man, that Made a Marvellous Castle, and Cleped it Paradise; and of His Subtlety.\" Gatholonabes invites knights into his castle, and Mandeville says that \"often-time, he was revenged of his enemies by his subtle deceits and false cautels.\" In the Oxen passage \"subtility\" is attributed to Bloom (\"a man of cautels and a subtile\"), who later in Ulysses will invite Stephen into his house with the crafty intention of involving him with his wife or daughter. Janusko observes that Joyce recorded phrases from yet another of Saintsbury's \"choice things,\" the story \"Of the Devil's head in the Valley Perilous,\" which \"concerns the penetration of a marvelous and dangerous place, one of the entries of hell\" (61), suggesting that it too could have prompted his fancy of a perilous entrance. \n Any or all of these three stories could have inspired Joyce's first paragraph, which tells of a \"traveller\" who resists the invitation to enter a \"marvellous castle.\" Joyce added some lovely flourishes—he calls Dixon a \"learningknight\" (Joseph Dixon was a medical student who received his M.D. in December 1904), and he describes Bloom, who has come fresh from his encounter on the beach with Gerty Macdowell, as \"sore of limb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometime venery\"—but he stays within the outlines of Mandeville's conception.\n In the second paragraph, though, Joyce gave his imagination freer rein. In the Mandevillean spirit of childlike wonder he asks his readers to suppose that the figures carved into the legs of the wooden table \"durst not move for enchantment\"; that the forks and knives on the table were forged \"by swinking demons out of white flames that they fix in the horns of buffalos and stags\"; that the glasses have been blown out of \"seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that he blares into them like to bubbles\"; that sardines are \"strange fishes withouten heads\" held in a \"vat of silver that was moved by craft to open\"; that bread dough \"by aid of certain angry spirits that they do into it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountain\"; and that hops plants are serpents trained to \"entwine themselves up on long sticks out of the ground\" and give up their \"scales\" so that men may \"brew out a beverage like to mead.\" \n Details in the Travels certainly inspired some of these transformations. The tin can \"moved by craft\" quotes verbatim from chapter 30 of the medieval text, and the headless sardines recall Asian creatures that Mandeville describes in chapter 24: \"monsters and folk disfigured, some without heads, some with great ears, some with one eye, some giants, some with horses’ feet, and many other diverse shape against kind.\" The headless folk appeared in countless illustrations of the Travels in the 1400s and 1500s and inspired Shakespeare's \"Anthropophagi, and men whose heads / Do grow beneath their shoulders\" (Othello 1.3.144-45). The enchanted dwarves holding up the table likewise may owe something to a passage in chapter 23 that describes the \"montour\" of the great Chan: \"And at four corners of the mountour be four serpents of gold.\" Details like these suggest that Joyce read widely in the Travels, far beyond the brief excerpts in Saintsbury and Peacock, but they do not detract from the brilliance of his invention. Mandeville writes matter-of-factly of wonders in far-off lands. Joyce ingeniously suggests that a magical reality may underlie the mundane facts of Dublin life. He outdoes Mandeville at his own game. \n Joyce's third paragraph provides an indication of why Bloom regards the \"castle\" as dangerous (he does not like to drink immoderately, and likes drunken society even less), and of how he is \"subtle\" (he pours his drink into his neighbor's glass without being detected). The paragraph ends with another clear echo of the Mandevillean text: \"Thanked be Almighty God.\" This phrase appears verbatim in chapters 21 and 31 of the Travels, and near equivalents can be found in the Prologue and chapter 15.\n Joyce's extensive reading of Mandeville appears also in the Middle English vocabulary sprinkled throughout these three paragraphs, especially the first one. Some of these words are staples of the Travels:\n \"mickle\" (great, much)\n \"meat\" (food of any kind)\n \"yclept\" [\"cleped\" or \"clept\" in Mandeville] (called, named)\n \"sithen\" (since)\n \"cautels\" (craftiness, trickery)\n \"trowed\" (believed)\n \"contrarious\" (opposed)\n \"list\" (will, inclination)\n \"marches\" (walks, but also remote boundary territories)\n \"environing\" (surrounding, extending around)\n \"full fair\" (very beautiful)\n \"wight\" (man)\n \"natheless\" (nevertheless)\n \"apertly\" (openly, clearly)\n \"no manner\" (no kind)\n \"voided\" (emptied)\n Joyce threw in other medieval words he knew. Calling Bloom \"childe Leopold\" makes him a man of noble birth who has not yet attained knighthood. Saying that he \"did up his beaver\" imagines him raising the lower part of his helmet (the Middle English \"bever\") to drink beer—or perhaps, as Sam Slote suggests, simply raising his drink (also \"bever\") to his lips. When the narrative says that nurse Callan \"was of his avis,\" it means that she shared Bloom's \"advice\" (i.e., counsel, opinion), and her chastisement of Dixon likewise uses an archaic version of a familiar word: \"repreved\" means simply \"reproved.\" Similarly, \"halp\" means \"helped,\" and \"mandement\" means \"command.\" That \"the traveller Leopold was couth\" to Dixon means that he was known to him. The \"swinking demons\" are laboring. The neighbor who \"nist not of his wile\" did not know that Bloom had poured drink into his glass. \n Bloom's desire to \"go otherwhither\" needs no gloss, but this archaic and rare word, cited just once by the OED in a 16th century text, is a philologist's delight. The Lord knows where Joyce found it, but he does seem to be echoing a sentence from Mandeville's Prologue which says that a tribe without a chieftain is like \"a flock of sheep without a shepherd; the which departeth and disperseth and wit never whither to go.\""

Gifford notes that \"It was once a fashionable and thriving quarter of the city,\" but in 1904 it contained many tenements, and nearly all of the book's references evoke grinding poverty.",

In Eumaeus Bloom thinks that the immigrants \"over in little Italy there near the Coombe were sober thrifty hardworking fellows except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless necessary animal of the feline persuasion of others at night.\" \n The only mention of this area that does not reek of alcohol, dirt, and illicit activities comes in Ithaca, when the narrative recalls Bloom's baptism \"in the protestant church of Saint Nicholas Without, Coombe.\" Bloom grew up on Clanbrassil Street, not far south of The Coombe's eastern end."

  "110007croppyboy": {
    "note": " One of the signature songs of Sirens is \"The Croppy Boy,\" a melodramatic 1840s ballad about the Rebellion of 1798. It focuses on a poor Catholic boy whose ambition to join the fight against tyranny is cut short by a British army captain who dons the disguise of a priest to hear the boy's confession. \"Croppies\" were rebels who wore their hair cropped short.",
    "expandedNote": " Many of the leaders of the United Irishmen uprising of 1798 were Protestant gentry, but most of the poorly armed men who fought in the ranks were Catholics. Imitating the French revolutionaries who cut their hair short to distinguish themselves from the powdered wigs of their aristocratic enemies, many Irish commoners began cutting their hair short in the 1790s. Even before the advent of armed struggle, the authorities, alarmed at the prospect of revolution spreading to Britain and Ireland, treated these sympathizers with savage brutality. Among their inventive tortures was the practice of \"pitchcapping\": pouring hot tar into a linen cone, placing it on a croppy's head, allowing it to cool, and then ripping it off along with the victim's hair and scalp. \n Nestor alludes to a contemporary loyalist song called Croppies Lie Down, which taunts the rebels as cowards who lie down in terror whenever real soldiers come on the scene, and who will lie down in mass graves when the fighting is done. In 1845 William McBurney, under the pseudonym Caroll Malone, published a contrary ballad about the Rebellion in the newspaper The Nation, appealing to republican sympathizers. Instead of aggressively taunting the losers, the Malone song pulls on listeners' heartstrings, making the tragedy of a lost cause poignantly personal:\n \"Good men and true in this house who dwell\n To a stranger buachaill I pray you tell [boy]\n Is the priest at home? or may he be seen?\n I would speak a word with Father Green.\"\n \"The priests's at home, boy, and may be seen:\n 'Tis easy speaking with Father Green;\n But you must wait, till I go and see\n If the holy father alone may be.\"\n The youth has entered an empty hall—\n What a lonely sound has his light footfall!\n And the gloomy chamber's cold and bare\n With a vested priest in a lonely chair.\n The youth has knelt to tell his sins;\n \"Nomine Dei,\" the youth begins; [in God's name]\n At \"mea culpa,\" he beats his breast, [I have sinned]\n And in broken murmurs he speaks the rest.\n \"At the siege of Ross did my father fall\n And at Gorey my loving brothers all;\n I alone am left to my name and race;\n I will go to Wexford to take their place.\"\n \"I cursed three times since last Easter day—\n And at mass-time once I went to play;\n I passed the churchyard one day in haste\n And forgot to pray for my mother's rest.\"\n \"I bear no hate against living thing\n But I love my country above the King.\n Now Father, bless me and let me go\n To die, if God has ordained it so.\"\n The priest said naught, but a rustling noise\n Made the youth look up in wild surprise;\n The robes were off, and in scarlet there\n Sat a yeoman captain with fiery glare.\n With fiery glare and with fury hoarse,\n Instead of a blessing he breathed a curse:\n \"'Twas a good thought, boy, to come here and shrive,\n For one short hour is your time to live.\n \"Upon yon river three tenders float\n The priest's in one, if he isn't shot—\n We hold this house for our Lord and King,\n And Amen! say I, may all traitors swing!\"\n At Geneva Barracks that young man died,\n And at Passage they have his body laid.\n Good people who live in peace and joy\n Breathe a prayer, shed a tear for the Croppy Boy.\n \"At the siege of Ross did my father fall,\" which Tom Kernan recalls in Wandering Rocks, refers to an early military action in the conflict. On June 5, a force of about 10,000 County Wexford rebels who had recently taken the town of Wexford attacked the town of New Ross, which was defended by a garrison of about 2,000 regular British army troops. The attackers were armed mostly with pikes while the defenders had muskets, cannons, and cavalry. Although the rebels succeeding in capturing a large portion of the town, British reinforcements drove them back and finally routed them. Between casualties in the battle and massacres afterward, the attackers lost a quarter to a third of their men—the bloodiest action of the 1798 Rebellion and a great demoralization for the rebel cause.\n Kernan mistakenly attributes the line about the Ross battle to a different 1845 song about the Rebellion, but he remembers Ben Dollard's \"Masterly rendition\" of The Croppy Boy. (In Hades, the funeralgoers mock the flossy language Kernan uses to describe \"Ben Dollard's singing of The Croppy Boy\": \"His singing of that simple ballad, Martin, is the most trenchant rendering I ever heard in the whole course of my experience.\") Dollard performs the piece in Sirens, and many other lines of the ballad float through on his deep bass voice. The overture features only a few words of the boy (\"Naminedamine. All gone. All fallen\") and the captain (\"Amen! He gnashed in fury\"). But the body of the chapter repeats or echoes nearly every verse of the song, beginning with Simon Dedalus' reminder of the opening words, \"Good men and true,\" and continuing for about four pages in most print editions. \n For the convenience of the reader who wants to chart the progress of the song through the chapter, these echoes are highlighted in purple in my online edition of the novel. And for anyone listening to the Kevin McDermott recording of the song attached here, boldfaced lyrics show which details surface in the chapter. Joyce echoes every stanza, in order, filling the spaces between these heard details with his protagonist's thoughts. Bloom disdains the song's easy manipulation of patriotism and piety—\"They know it all by heart. The thrill they itch for\"—and he resolves to get out of the bar before the rush of congratulations and the inevitable round of drinks \"to wash it down.\" But the song reaches its conclusion as he shuffles out, and all the other listeners are \"deepmoved.\"\n A postscript: in 1966 Seamus Heaney composed a Requiem for the Croppies utterly devoid of melodrama or sentimentality:\n The pockets of our greatcoats full of barley—\n No kitchens on the run, no striking camp—\n We moved quick and sudden in our own country.\n The priest lay behind ditches with the tramp.\n A people, hardly marching—on the hike—\n We found new tactics happening each day: \n We'd cut through reins and rider with the pike\n And stampede cattle into infantry, \n Then retreat through hedges where cavalry must be thrown.\n Until, on Vinegar Hill, the final conclave.\n Terraced thousands died, shaking scythes at cannon.\n The hillside blushed, soaked in our broken wave.\n They buried us without shroud or coffin\n And in August the barley grew up out of the grave. \n The battle on Vinegar Hill on June 21 reversed the New Ross positions of June 5, with British forces now attacking Wexford pikemen massed on the hill. But the Irishmen's crude fortifications offered little protection from British artillery firing shrapnel-producing rounds and grapeshot, and croppies again died in huge numbers. In Lestrygonians, Bloom thinks of young protesters yelling \"Vinegar hill,\" in actions as futile as the historical event they celebrate."

    "note": " Deasy's point in saying \"I remember the famine in '46\" seems to be not only to remind Stephen how long he has been around, but also to lay claim to some historical authenticity, as if he knew the sufferings and can speak authoritatively about their significance. Perhaps no single perspective can be adequate for comprehending this appalling holocaust, but if anyone is not fit to claim special insight, it is a Unionist member of the Protestant ruling class.",
    "expandedNote": " Many have claimed that what happened in 1845-52 was not a famine at all, since food was being produced abundantly in Ireland throughout these years, but rather a genocidal government policy of mass starvation. This claim is highly debatable, but it cannot be denied that the more than one million deaths, and the comparable number of people driven to leave their ancestral land for America (in a population of only eight million), were not caused by a fungal blight on the potato crop. They were caused by a brutally oppressive system of landholding that had reduced rural Catholics to a state of serfdom so inhumanly wretched that millions were subsisting by eating nothing but potatoes (eight pounds a day were required), while the rich fruits of a fertile country (corn, wheat, beef, pork) were exported to England. For a long time, British government policy had discouraged Irish industry while encouraging the export of wheat and cattle to feed English appetites. Huge numbers of peasants, unable to earn money in any way, subsisted on the potatoes that they could grow on their tiny plots of land.\n Nor can it plausibly be claimed that the crop failure could not be foreseen or managed. In the famine of 1782-83, the government in Dublin had closed the ports to exports, over the objections of merchants. Food prices fell, and people ate. In the famine that began in 1845, the government in Westminster kept the ports open, and people starved. (Daniel O'Connell observed in 1845 that Belgium was dealing with the blight by closing its ports to exports and opening them to imports. He argued that the same would be happening in Ireland if the country had self-government.) Over the course of at least a century potato crops had failed many times before, and dozens of government commissions and studies in the decades prior to the arrival of the fungus had predicted disaster in rural Ireland, but nothing had been done to forestall it. As the magnitude of the looming crisis began to be apparent, the government did undertake programs to alleviate it, but most of them were poorly conceived, niggardly, and ineffectual.\n The famine was not a happy time for Protestant landlords. Gifford notes that \"many tried to tide their peasants over the famine and were ruined in the process\" (35). But they bore as much responsibility as the British government for the economic arrangements that produced \"the worst event of its kind recorded in European history at a time of peace\" (Gifford, 35)."

    "note": " Strains of the nursery rhyme The House that Jack Built sound twice in Oxen of the Sun. In his mocking rant against the church Stephen refers to \"Peter Piscator who lives in the house that Jack built,\" and in the medley of anonymous voices at the end of the chapter someone calls the man in the macintosh a \"Man all tattered and torn that married a maiden all forlorn.\"",
    "expandedNote": " The nursery rhyme is a cumulative one that adds things to Jack's house until a mnemonically challenging string of relative clauses has piled up:\n This is the horse and the hound and the horn\n That belonged to the farmer sowing his corn\n That kept the rooster that crowed in the morn\n That woke the judge all shaven and shorn\n That married the man all tattered and torn\n That kissed the maiden all forlorn\n That milked the cow with the crumpled horn\n That tossed the dog that worried the cat\n That killed the rat that ate the malt\n That lay in the house that Jack built.\n The accumulation of animals strikingly resembles the Aramaic song called Chad Gadya that Bloom thinks of in Aeolus, so much so that some people have speculated that the ancient Jewish rhyme may have inspired it. The Gentile version appeared in many 18th and 19th century children's books. \n Jesus founded his church on the rock of Simon Peter, the fisherman who became first in a long line of bishops of Rome—so, when Stephen speaks of \"Peter Piscator\" (Peter the Fisherman) living in the house that Jack built, he is referring to the pope presiding over his Catholic church, or perhaps residing in his Vatican digs. Calling the unknown man in the raincoat \"tattered and torn\" extends observations made of him by the men in Burke's (\"Golly, whatten tunket's yon guy in the mackintosh? Dusty Rhodes. Peep at his wearables. . . . D'ye ken bare socks? Seedy cuss . . . That, sir, was once a prosperous cit\"), and \"married a maiden all forlorn\" expresses their belief that he roams the streets mourning a woman who died (\"Slung her hook, she did. Here see lost love. Walking Mackintosh of lonely canyon\"). \n Although the ditty's words are sufficient to account for these allusions, it may be worth noting that, in a novel filled with memories of pantomimes, a number of these vaudevillean dramatic productions seem to have been based on the nursery rhyme. One of them played at the Sadler's Wells Theatre in London in 1850 and 1851. The Sheffield City Archives house another one written by J. H. Booth in 1900. And J. G. Farrell's 1970 novel Troubles, set in Ireland ca. 1919-1921, records that \"a man sitting in the stalls of the Empire [the name for the Dublin theater earlier called Dan Lowrey's Music Hall] was shot in the chest while watching the pantomime The House that Jack Built\" (325)."

In 1904 it was a blighted part of town whose tenement houses were crammed with the unemployed and destitute, prostitutes and criminals, middle-class citizens in danger of joining the underclass, and struggling immigrants.",
    "expandedNote": " The area got its name from the fact that lands that were eventually incorporated into the city began as the holdings of certain churches and aristocratic families, notably the Earls of Meath and the two cathedrals now known as Christ Church and St. Patrick's. English kings and courts granted exemption from city taxation and authorized the Liberties to establish their own courts and exercise economic powers. Freedom from municipal control enabled some of these areas to establish thriving textile manufacturing businesses in the 17th and 18th centuries. People who prospered in the weaving trade built many wealthy homes, as well as a weavers' guildhall. But various laws and economic forces conspired to destroy this prosperity by the end of the 18th century, and the 19th century saw uninterrupted decline. The wealthy houses were chopped up into apartments catering to the impoverished.\n The detail from a 1798 map at right shows several of the streets in the area that are mentioned in the novel. The Coombe, where the green and blue markings overlap (its name is unfortunately obscured by both these lines) runs east-west from Pimlico to Patrick Street. Due south of the eastern end of The Coombe is \"Fumbailies La.\" (\"Fumbally's Lane\" in Aeolus), running east from the north end of Black Pitts. To the east of The Coombe, and just a little north, is St. Patrick's Cathedral, and to the east of that Marsh's Library.

Two or three hours past sunset, on such nights, one can still make out newspaper headlines by skyshine, and at no time between dusk and dawn does the northern sky really darken\" (1).\n In Nausicaa, which takes place between 8 and 9 PM, we learn at the outset that \"the sun was setting.\" At the end of the chapter, when the sun has set and \"the nine o'clock postman\" is making his rounds, the narrative reads, \"Howth settled for slumber, tired of long days, of yumyum rhododendrons (he was old) and felt gladly the night breeze lift, ruffle his fell of ferns. He lay but opened a red eye unsleeping, deep and slowly breathing, slumberous but awake.\" Bloom too is slumbrous but awake: \"Must be getting on for nine by the light. Go home.

    "expandedNote": " When Mulligan, a medical student, says in Telemachus that he sees people \"pop off every day in the Mater and Richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom,\" he is referring to two different hospitals: the Richmond Lunatic Asylum (now known as St. Brendan's Hospital) which he has already snidely characterized as “Dottyville,\" and the Mater Misericordiae, a large and distinguished teaching hospital.\n In Hades Bloom passes by the hospital when the funeral procession travels up Berkeley Street (the western end of Eccles terminates at Berkeley). He thinks of the day several weeks earlier (May 23) when a bee stung him in his garden and a young doctor named Dixon treated his wound: \"The Mater Misericordiae. Eccles street. My house down there. Big place. Ward for incurables there. Very encouraging. Our Lady's Hospice for the dying. Deadhouse handy underneath. Whereold Mrs Riordan died. . . . Nice young student that was dressed that bite the bee gave me. He's gone over to the lying-in hospital they told me.

  "160001priestpoverty": {
    "note": " In Nestor Mr. Deasy urges Stephen not to carry his money loose in his pocket, warning him that \"You'll pull it out somewhere and lose it.\" Stephen's problem, he says, is that \"you don't save.\" Later in the novel Bloom forms similar impressions. By making a Protestant and a Jew agree about Stephen's terrible money problems, the novel insinuates a cultural critique of Irish Catholicism. In Eumaeus Bloom makes the criticism explicit, arguing that \"in the economic, not touching religion, domain, the priest spells poverty.\" His thinking here recalls that of the great German sociologist Max Weber.",
    "expandedNote": " Joyce modeled Stephen's financial profligacy on his own behavior. In 1904 he wrote to Nora Barnacle, \"How could I like the idea of home? My home was simply a middle-class affair ruined by spendthrift habits which I have inherited\" (Letters II, 48). To a considerable extent these \"spendthrift habits\" remained ingrained in him even after he established a home with Nora, fathered two children, and worked to support his family. In Ulysses he seems to assign blame to environmental influences larger than just a ne'er-do-well father. \n The would-be paternal advice of Mr. Deasy is charged with no small amount of cultural antagonism. The financial wisdom that he offers—\"You don't yet know what money is. Money is power\"—may express the ruling-class complacency of landed Ascendancy elites, or the prudential earnestness of Ulster Presbyterians, or both, but it certainly does not speak to the Catholic sensibility of Stephen, for whom wealth and power alike are unimaginable and undesirable abstractions. This confrontation in the headmaster's office feels emblematic of the gulf between Irish Protestants and Catholics, which has only grown since an artificial border between North and South prompted segregation and emigration. \n Deasy may despise the \"jew merchants,\" but the book suggests that they share his ethos of saving and prudent investment. Bloom, who has learned thrift from his Jewish father and does not waste money on alcohol like most of his fellow Dubliners, has managed to accumulate a respectable amount of savings and owns shares in a Canadian railway business. He is acutely aware that only these savings stand between him and the penurious old age that awaits men like Ben Dollard, and he believes that something in Catholic culture encourages people to neglect the cultivation of worldly prosperity. \n In Eumaeus, after telling Stephen about the anti-Semitic attack he endured in Cyclops, Bloom defends his ethnic heritage: \"History—would you be surprised to learn?—proves up to the hilt Spain decayed when the inquisition hounded the jews out and England prospered when Cromwell, an uncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer for, imported them. Why? Because they are imbued with the proper spirit. They are practical and are proved to be so. I don't want to indulge in any... because you know the standard works on the subject and then orthodox as you are... But in the economic, not touching religion, domain, the priest spells poverty. Spain again, you saw in the war, compared with goahead America. Turks. It's in the dogma. Because if they didn't believe they'd go straight to heaven when they die they'd try to live better—at least so I think.\"\n Chief among \"the standard works on the subject\" at the time Joyce wrote his novel, although it was not translated into English until 1930, was Max Weber's The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (1904-5). Weber sought to explain the economic success of the northern European countries (and of \"goahead America,\" which he visited and was tremendously impressed by) precisely by identifying their \"proper spirit\" or Geist. This spirit, he argued, was the Protestant ethos of working hard, saving money, and putting money to work—what is now commonly called the Protestant work ethic. \n Weber believed, with Bloom, that religion typically has the effect of valuing otherworldly goods and devaluing prosperity in this world. But he argued that Luther and Calvin, by attacking the idea of gaining salvation through priestly intervention, located morality and spirituality in the secular world of work. People could now find callings not in traditional religious vocations but in their chosen occupations, an attitude which led to the accumulation of money. And Reformation churches, especially the Calvinist ones, taught believers not to waste that money on sinful luxuries, or the charitable donations so encouraged by the Catholic church, but to invest it. Weber quotes the adage of his secular saint Benjamin Franklin that \"money can beget money\": put to work, it grows.\n The issue for Weber, and seemingly for Joyce as well, is not whether to choose one religion or another, but rather to assess how well different religions value human industry and thrift. Judaism does not enter into Weber's calculus, but Bloom's words suggest that it should: its \"practical,\" this-worldly orientation makes it a candidate for praise, not for abuse, in the secularized modern world."

    "note": " The \"Rotunda, Rutland square\" is a group of connected buildings on Rutland (now Parnell) Square, just beyond the north end of Upper Sackville (now O'Connell) Street where it leads into Cavendish Row. The complex housed the oldest maternity hospital in Ireland, and possibly the world, in addition to theaters for arts and entertainment, and rooms for hosting social and fundraising events.",
    "expandedNote": " The hospital building opened in 1757 as the new home of The Dublin Lying-In Hospital, which Bartholomew Mosse had founded a decade earlier in George's Lane. The architect, Richard Cassels, designed the large circular Rotunda, finished several years later, as an entertainment space, because the hospital was not-for-profit and needed to raise funds. Today, the Gate Theatre and the Ambassador Theatre reside in the complex.\n Bloom passes the hospital on his way to the Glasnevin cemetery in Hades. Before his funeral train can get through the intersection another one passes in front, possibly bearing a baby who has died in childbirth at the hospital: \"White horses with white frontlet plumes came round the Rotunda corner, galloping. A tiny coffin flashed by.\" In Sirens Blazes Boylan passes the Rotunda on his way to the Blooms' house, adding to the list of urban landmarks that both men see as they travel up Sackville Street: Sir John Gray's statue, Elvery's, Nelson's pillar, Father Mathew's statue.\n Ithaca also mentions that Bloom has gone to see the circus in the Rotunda: \"once at a performance of Albert Hengler's circus in the Rotunda, Rutland square, Dublin, an intuitive particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring to a place in the auditorium where Bloom, solitary, was seated and had publicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he (Bloom) was his (the clown's) papa.\" The so-called \"Round Room\" inside the Rotunda proper was an ornate performance space, with beautiful Corinthian pilasters and stuccoed recesses. Because it had no interior columns supporting the roof, it could accommodate very large audiences, as seen in the engraving at right. In addition to popular entertainments like the circus, many important musical concerts were held there. See https://basilwalsh.wordpress.com/tag/dublin-rotunda."

  "010106sacredpint": {
    "note": " In Telemachus Mulligan says that \"The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus.\" The sacredness of drink is a joke told with deep conviction in Ulysses. Mulligan has earlier proposed a lunchtime drinking bout by spouting the national creed, \"Ireland expects that every man this day will do his duty,\" and he is right about intoxication unbinding Stephen’s tongue. When we meet Stephen in a highly inebriated state in Oxen of the Sun he is unusually voluble, and one of the first things he says, while filling his companions' cups, is that man does not live by bread alone.",
    "expandedNote": " Stephen perverts the biblical saying to mean that alcohol is more important than food: “Now drink we, quod he, of this mazer and quaff ye this mead which is not indeed parcel of my body but my soul’s bodiment. Leave ye fraction of bread to them that live by bread alone.” Finnegans Wake repeats the idea with countless associations, including a punning coincidence of Guinness and Genesis. In Aeolus, Lenehan uses the same drinkers' pun to praise the natural returning of water to water: \"Our old ancient ancestors, as we read in the first chapter of Guinness's, were partial to the running stream.\"\n Ithaca and Finnegans Wake allude to one historical encouragement of this association of inebriation with religious practice. The Franciscan church off Merchant's Quay popularly known as Adam and Eve's was founded in the 17th century as an \"underground\" church, to evade the English suppression of Catholic worship. Rosemary Lane hosted a tavern called Adam and Eve's. Franciscan friars secretly said Mass there, and later built a church on the lane; since the tavern had signboards on both entrances to the lane, worshipers could enter the street pretending to be going for a drink."

    "note": " Ulysses contains several references to \"the Ship,\" a public house on Lower Abbey Street, which runs east from O’Connell Street (Sackville Street in 1904), only two blocks north of the Liffey in the heart of downtown. Stephen Dedalus and Buck Mulligan make plans to meet there for drinks, but Stephen skips the appointment and instead sends Buck a taunting telegram at the Ship. Much later in the book, Stephen and Bloom discuss the possibility of meeting at the tavern for continued conversation.",
    "expandedNote": " In Dublin in Bloomtime: The City James Joyce Knew (Viking, 1969), Cyril Pearl notes that this large pub, \"destroyed during the Troubles, had a long musical tradition\" of hosting live performances, and was also \"very popular with writers and journalists\" (29). Mulligan evidently spends a lot of time there. In Telemachus he mentions talking about Stephen with a \"fellow I was with in the Ship last night.\" Later in that chapter he reminds Stephen of their plan to meet for drinks at the Ship at \"Half twelve\" (12:30), after Stephen's morning duties as a teacher are completed, and in Scylla and Charybdis he complains that Stephen did not show, leaving him and Haines \"one hour and two hours and three hours in Connery's sitting civil waiting for pints apiece.\" W. and E. Connery were listed in the 1904 Thom's as the pub's proprietors. (The poster displayed here shows a different proprietor, J. Davin.)\n The book never directly represents Stephen's decision to avoid meeting Mulligan at the Ship. In Proteus he appears to think of it as an obligation, like his promise to Deasy: \"I mustn't forget his letter for the press. And after? The Ship, half twelve. By the way go easy with that money like a good young imbecile.\" Does Stephen think, from an unaccustomed access of prudence, to dodge the predatory plan that Mulligan has expressed in Telemachus to \"have a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids\" at the expense of Stephen's \"Four omnipotent sovereigns\"? It's tempting to suppose so, but at about the same time that he had agreed to meet Mulligan for drinks, Stephen treats the hangers-on in the newspaper office to drinks. Financial prudence seems less important to him than an aversion to Mulligan himself.\n § Whatever reasons Stephen may have for dodging the meeting, the book supplies one of its own, via the network of parallels with Homer's Odyssey built up in the first chapter. At the end of Book 2 of the Odyssey, Telemachus ships out of Ithaca, to inquire about his father on the mainland. On his return at the end of Book 4, Antinous and nineteen other suitors lie in ambush for him behind an island that he must pass. Athena helps him to escape the deadly trap. Stephen similarly evades his antagonist. Instead of meeting Mulligan at the pub he sends him a taunting telegram from only a short distance away. We learn of this development in Scylla and Charybdis, when Mulligan finds Stephen in the library and Stephen thinks (in Shakespearean idiom), \"Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?\" Shortly later in the episode, Mulligan regales him with the experience of receiving the telegram: \"Malachi Mulligan, The Ship, lower Abbey street. O, you peerless mummer! O, you priestified Kinchite!\"\n In Ithaca, the narrator enumerates a series of \"counterproposals\" to Bloom's proposal (declined by Stephen) to have Stephen stay the night at 7 Eccles Street. One of these is the idea that they will meet at \"the Ship hotel and tavern, 6 Lower Abbey street (W. and E. Connery, proprietors).\" Pretty clearly, this suggestion must have come from Stephen and it indicates a desire to have Bloom replace Mulligan as a guide and advice-giver. The reference to the Ship in Ithaca, then, confirms Bloom's role as Odysseus, the counterpart to Mulligan's Antinous."

  "020032theunion": {
    "note": " Twice in close succession in Nestor Mr. Deasy refers to \"the union,\" one of the most consequential and contentious events of Irish history, and twice he falsely represents attitudes toward it. The clear suggestion is that his unionist perspective is founded upon false consciousness. Union refers to the legislative act of 1800 by which the Irish Parliament in Dublin was dissolved and government of the island transferred to the British Parliament in Westminster, effective 1 January 1801. The Union still remains in force today in Northern Ireland.",
    "expandedNote": " Deasy's claim that \"the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the union twenty years before O'Connell did\" is misleading at best. The Lodges, which were dedicated to British rule of Ireland and to Protestant domination of Catholics, did strongly oppose the Union at first, but they quickly became rabid supporters. The other claim, that Sir John Blackwood voted for the union, is simply false; he intended to vote no. \n Catholics lacked the vote in the 1790s, and the Irish Parliament in Dublin was stuffed with Protestant aristocrats and landholders. Nevertheless, the ideal of an independent and inclusive Ireland appealed to many Protestants of the time—even in Ulster, as is clearly demonstrated by the ecumenical orientation of the United Irishmen and its eventual commitment to rebellion. Additionally, the Grattan Constitution of 1782 had given the Irish Parliament a large measure of independence, and many of its members were reluctant to vote their body out of existence and cede power to Westminster. But the British government was determined to consolidate control of the island after the 1798 rebellion, and it resorted to bribery on a massive scale, including promises of peerages to members who would switch their votes. The first vote in 1799 (the one that Sir John died trying to attend) failed. The second one, in 1800, succeeded. \n The Act of Union repeated the process that had united Scotland with England in a \"United Kingdom\" in 1707. That union proved more beneficial for Scotland than the Irish one did for the Irish, but it was enacted by similarly disgraceful means. Scottish legislators were bribed so massively that Robert Burns could write, \n The English steel we could disdain,\n Secure in valour's station.\n But English gold has been our bane.\n Such a parcel of rogues in a nation!\n The 1800 legislation bequeathed to Ireland a legacy of bitter contention between unionists and nationalists that was not completely resolved even by the founding of the Irish Free State in 1922. As for the magnificent Parliament building in which the votes were taken, in 1802 it was sold to the Bank of Ireland after the legislation made it useless. Gifford notes that it was sold \"with the stipulation that the chamber of the House of Commons be altered so that it could not be used as a place for public discussion and debate,\" and it remains a bank today. The conversion into a banking establishment is apt, Parliament having been, according to another line of the Burns song, \"bought and sold for English gold.\"\n In Wandering Rocks Ned Lambert refers to the moving of the bank from its old headquarters near St. Mary's Abbey, telling Reverend Love that \"the old bank of Ireland was over the way till the time of the union.\""

  "110005theatreroyal": {
    "note": " The \"Theatre Royal in Hawkins street,\" so identified in Ithaca, was one of several large theaters in Dublin in 1904, along with the Queen's Theatre and the Gaiety Theatre, offering middle-brow entertainment like pantomimes, light opera, musical comedy, music-hall shows, variety shows, and popular drama. Over the course of nearly a century and a half it operated in several different buildings on the same site: the \"old Royal\" recalled several times in Ulysses (1821-80), the newer structure that Joyce knew (1987-1935), and a third facility that was built much later (1935-62).",
    "expandedNote": " The Royal is first mentioned in Sirens, when Richie Goulding recalls a vocal performance he attended there: \"Never would Richie forget that night. As long as he lived: never. In the gods of the old Royal with little Peake.\" The \"old\" Royal was actually the third such theater of that name in Dublin, but it was the first to be built in Hawkins Street, just south of the quays between the O'Connell Bridge and the Loopline Bridge. It staged performances until it burned to the ground in 1880. A replacement called Leinster Hall operated from 1880 to 1897, at which time a new Theatre Royal was constructed on the same site, capable of seating slightly more than 2,000 people. \n \"The gods\" refers to the high balcony seats, playing on the notion of watching from the heavens. Gifford identifies it as \"Slang for the upper balcony of a theater,\" and Slote quotes Eric Partridge's definition of the term as \"those occupying the gallery at a theatre.\" In Circe Mrs. Yelverton Barry complains that Bloom has used his position in those high seats to peer into her décolletage: \"He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as I sat in a box of the Theatre Royal at a command performance of La Cigale. I deeply inflamed him, he said.\" Being a creature of his fantasy, she knows his libidinal assocations with the theater, confirmed later in the chapter when he thinks of places that aroused his adolescent lust: \"I was in my teens, a growing boy. A little then sufficed, a jolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies' cloakroom and lavatory, the throng penned tight on the old Royal stairs (for they love crushes, instinct of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice), even a pricelist of their hosiery.\" \n Mrs. Yelverton Barry is a figment of imagination, but there can be little doubt that Bloom has hankered after women's provocatively displayed breasts in the theater. Since La Cigale could refer either to an 1877 play or to an 1890 opera, his fantasy could have been triggered either pre-1880 or post-1897, but his memory of having sexual thoughts \"on the old Royal stairs\" when \"in my teens, a growing boy,\" lends weight to the view that he is recalling an adolescent incident. When the old theater burned down on 9 February 1880, Bloom would have been several months shy of 14 years old. Both theaters had box seats along the side walls. The existence of a vice-regal box in 1880 (Henry Egerton, the stage manager and business manager who died fighting the fire, was last seen near this box) coheres with Mrs. Yelverton Barry's memory of \"a command performance,\" i.e. one commissioned by the Lord Lieutenant. But perhaps the newer Royal also contained such a box.\n Molly has taken her daughter to see a play in the new Royal, and her recollection of how prissily Milly guarded her fancy skirt prompts further thoughts about the erotic currents in theaters: \"then a great touchmenot too in her own way at the Only Way in the Theatre royal take your foot away out of that I hate people touching me afraid of her life Id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that touching must go on in theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always trying to wiggle up to you that fellow in the pit at the Gaiety for Beerbohm Tree in Trilby the last time Ill ever go there to be squashed like that for any Trilby.\"\n The new Royal lasted until the mid-1930s, when it was replaced by yet another reincarnation on the same spot, capable of seating nearly 4,000 patrons. This huge theater, one of the largest in Europe, closed its doors in 1962 and was demolished to make way for the twelve-story Hawkins House, a hideous office building."

  "040071theyunderstand": {
    "note": " Although Bloom's entire dialogue with his cat probably reflects its influence, two sentences in particular allude to a section of Michel de Montaigne's Apology for Raymond Sebond (1568). Bloom thinks, \"They call them stupid. They understand what we say better than we understand them.\" These sentences acknowledge Montaigne's conviction that human intelligence and language are not so extraordinary as human beings commonly suppose: their origins lie in animal powers, and many analogues to their operations can be found in other creatures.",
    "expandedNote": " Montaigne's Apology is a sprawling examination of various Christian theological positions, relentlessly critical of the vanity of human presumption and animated throughout by skepticism about the efficacy of human reason. In one highly readable section this skepticism takes the form of comparing the mental powers of human beings to those of animals. Early in that section Montaigne writes of man, \"How does he know, by the force of his intelligence, the secret internal stirrings of animals? By what comparison between them and us does he infer the stupidity that he attributes to them? / When I play with my cat, who knows if I am not a pastime to her more than she is to me?\" (trans. Donald Frame).\n When Joyce substituted \"understand what we say\" for \"play with,\" he was borrowing from another passage a few sentences later in the Apology: \"This defect that hinders communication between them and us, why is it not just as much ours as theirs? It is a matter of guesswork whose fault it is that we do not understand one another; for we do not understand them any more than they do us.\" Here and elsewhere in the essay Montaigne argues that animals understand the intentions of other animals, albeit imperfectly, through various kinds of signals, often across species boundaries. Horses can tell when a dog's bark expresses aggression toward them; hearing another kind of bark, they are not alarmed. Birds utter different cries for different situations and their meaning is understood, often by other species. Nor are sounds needed to signify: countless physical gestures can communicate intentions, in animals as in humans.\n In addition to the many varieties of language, and the many structures, both social and architectural, that animals build, Montaigne argues that their behaviors show clear evidence of intellectual processes, to any observer who is not stubbornly determined to dismiss them as unconscious products of natural instinct. The fox that decides where to cross a frozen river by putting its ear to the ice to listen for rushing water; the dog that follows its master to three branching paths and, after finding no scent on two of them, goes charging up the third without sniffing; the thirsty bird that drops stones into a container until the water at the bottom rises to the top: in these and dozens of other examples Montaigne infers that the animal is thinking, just as everyone would infer that a human being who behaved similarly was thinking. He also observes evidence of compassion, fidelity, cooperation, gratitude, shame, anger, trickery, playacting, and a host of other supposedly human emotions, virtues, and powers.\n Bloom converses with his cat, and he attributes not only understanding but also humanlike emotions to her: \"vindictive,\" \"cruel.\" The narrative hovering near his consciousness does the same thing: \"shameclosing eyes,\" \"mewing plaintively,\" \"dark eyeslits narrowing with greed.\" Later in Calypso the transference is reversed: \"The ferreteyed porkbutcher,\" \"foxeyes,\" \"They used to believe you could be changed into an animal.\" To some extent Bloom is undoubtedly anthropomorphizing his cat, and the transformations of people into animals are more fanciful than declarative. But all these meditations on the commonalities between human beings and animals introduce the notion that the different species exist on a biological and psychological continuum.\n In previous chapters Stephen has imagined himself as a \"dogsbody\" and viewed a dog on the beach in strikingly human terms. Bloom's interest in animals breeds an interest in vegetarianism, and also a sense of compassion: he feeds not only his cat but also gulls hovering over the Liffey and a dog roaming the streets of Nighttown, and he once took a homeless dog into his household. He would probably agree with Montaigne that \"those who keep animals should be said rather to serve them than to be served by them.\"\n Ulysses in general might be said to exemplify Montaigne's statement that \"We are neither above nor below the rest.\" Humanity is part of an interconnected web of living things, and indeed things in general. The novel adumbrates a post-humanist perspective that might properly be called ecological."

    "note": " Stephen's distance from his own body is nowhere more evident than when he performs an act of excretion. His urination becomes so absorbed in poetic tissues of sound that the reader can barely tell that it is happening. The flowing of his own water makes a \"floating foampool\" on the swirling waters of Cock Lake, but that one familiar impression is nearly lost in a rhapsody of sounds and images: \"Listen: a fourworded wavespeech: seesoo, hrss, rsseeiss, ooos. Vehement breath of waters amid seasnakes, rearing horses, rocks. In cups of rocks it slops: flop, slop, slap: bounded in barrels. And, spent, its speech ceases. It flows purling, widely flowing, floating foampool, flower unfurling.\"",
    "expandedNote": " Nevertheless, thoughts of penises seem to be working underneath the surface of Stephen's consciousness. As the foam floats away, he imagines the weeds under the water's surface as women lifting up their skirts: \"Under the upswelling tide he saw the writhing weeds lift languidly and sway reluctant arms, hising up their petticoats, in whispering water swaying and upturning coy silver fronds.\" The \"hising up\" of petticoats recalls Mary Ann's urination in Telemachus, and \"writhing weeds\" and \"coy fronds\" make these female entities sexual beings. Soon they are \"Weary too in sight of lovers, lascivious men.\" Penises are still present two paragraphs later, as Stephen thinks of the corpse of the drowned man: \"A quiver of minnows, fat of a spongy titbit, flash through the slits of his buttoned trouserfly.\"\n [2017] Stephen's thoughts about his urine mingling with the waters of the ocean anticipate similar thoughts at the end of Lotus Eaters, where Bloom imagines his penis floating in a warm bath. Bloom has considered masturbating in the bath, and the thought of seminal fluid mingling with the bathwater sexualizes the image: \"He foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full, naked, in a womb of warmth, oiled by scented melting soap, softly laved. He saw his trunk and limbs riprippled over and sustained, buoyed lightly upward, lemonyellow: his navel, bud of flesh: and saw the dark tangled curls of his bush floating, floating hair of the stream around the limp father of thousands, a languid floating flower.\""

    "note": " Mulligan's mock Mass takes even more literally than does the Catholic church itself the mystery of transubstantiation at the heart of the ceremony. Encountering \"A little trouble about those white corpuscles,\" he asks the \"old chap\" upstairs to inject some more electricity into his magical cup, and announces that this extra quantum of energy has done the trick: \"That will do nicely. Switch off the current, will you?\"",
    "expandedNote": " The Mass reenacts biblical accounts of the Last Supper, in which Jesus symbolically gave his body and blood to his disciples as nourishment. Unlike other Christian churches, Catholicism interprets this symbolic action quite literally. When the priest consecrates the wafer and the wine, they become miraculously transformed into the body and blood of Christ—an ontologically different substance into which they are “transubstantiated.”\n As Mulligan holds aloft the chalice containing (or about to contain) God's blood, he acknowledges that some of the flecks of shaving foam are experiencing difficulty in their effort to become “white corpuscles,” the antigen-destroying part of the holy substance. Blood is not simply red stuff, but a compound of parts that exercise discrete functions. When medical students discuss miracles, they like to get their facts straight. \n And if transubstantiation means converting one form of matter into another, then according to modern physics some energy must have been introduced into the system. The Almighty presumably assists his ministers by tapping some power source such as electrical \"current.\""

  "030071threemaster": {
    "note": " At the end of Proteus Stephen looks back over his shoulder and sees the masts of a sailing ship floating into Dublin on the flood tide: \"Moving through the air high spars of a threemaster, her sails brailed up on the crosstrees, homing, upstream, silently moving, a silent ship.\"",
    "expandedNote": " Several aspects of this occurrence require comment. First, it is helpful to visualize where Stephen is and to realize exactly what he must be seeing. He is sitting on the seaward side of the South Wall, the long breakwater that separates the waters of the River Liffey on the north from the tide flats on the south. With high tide approaching, seawater is flowing in along the extended channel of the Liffey, facilitating the ship's approach to the Dublin docks. Its sails are furled on the yardarms because it is taking advantage of the tide.\n The seaward side of the wall is buttressed by massive granite blocks, which tumble some distance down to the water. Stephen must be sitting near the bottom of the wall of rocks, because, as he watched the tide approaching the seawall a short while earlier, he thought, \"My ashplant will float away.\" His location at the bottom of the wall accounts for the language of the narration, which says that the \"spars\" of a ship are \"Moving through the air.\" The body of the ship is apparently obscured by the wall of rock, meaning that Stephen sees a kind of surreal apparition: three masts with \"crosstrees\" hovering in the air, moving slowly to his left. This spectral appearance evokes the timeless, symbolic image of the three crosses at Calvary. \n But the ship is quite real. Joyce tells his reader nothing about it at this point, but later chapters will fill in some blanks. In Wandering Rocks, the throwaway that Bloom has thrown away into the Liffey floats \"eastward by flanks of ships and trawlers, amid an archipelago of corks, beyond new Wapping street past Benson's ferry, and by the threemasted schooner Rosevean from Bridgwater with bricks.\" Why name only one schooner among all the ships? The fact that it is identified as a threemaster may encourage an observant reader to suppose that this may be the ship that arrived in Dublin a few hours earlier.\n Eumaeus rewards this hypothetical reader with actionable information. In the cabman's shelter a grizzled sailor who calls himself D. B. Murphy says, \"We come up this morning eleven o'clock. The threemaster Rosevean from Bridgwater with bricks.\" Since Stephen was sitting along the wall at some time around 11:00, it must have been this threemaster that he saw. And Gifford notes that a schooner of that name was indeed reported in the Freeman's Journal of 16 June 1904 as having arrived in Dublin \"from Bridgwater with bricks.\" Bridgwater is in SW England, just west of Bristol. Gifford observes that \"it was well known for its manufacture of Bath bricks (scouring bricks used to clean knives and polish metal).\""

    "expandedNote": " In the blog accompanying his photo of a warning sign at right, Dara Connolly writes, \"This warning is no joke, and I didn’t take it lightly. I am no stranger to the risks of incoming tide, having got into serious trouble in the past and been lucky to survive. On this occasion I made sure that when the tide turned, we would be on our way back, even if we had not reached the edge of the sand.\" Beyond the sign, \"the sea had retreated very far, almost out of sight. The two ships visible on the horizon look odd, almost as if they are sailing across the sand.\" But even though the sands stretch on for miles, their shellcocoacoloured shelf will be covered very quickly, and irregularly, by the incoming tide, threatening to trap walkers on rapidly shrinking islands. \n Despite his safe position near the boulders, then, the tidal flats give Stephen ample opportunity to contemplate his morbid fear of drowning."

  "010108tilly": {
    "note": " Applying free indirect style in a small way to a minor character, the narrative of Telemachus approaches the language of the old milkwoman when it says \"She poured again a measureful and a tilly.\" Like the \"baker's dozen\" of English tradition, \"tilly\" is a Hiberno-English word for giving customers a little additional measure of the substance they are purchasing. It comes from the Irish tuilleadh, meaning \"extra\" or \"added.\"",
    "expandedNote": " In An Anglo-Irish Dialect Glossary for Joyce's Works (Syracuse UP, 1987), Richard Wall defines \"tilly\" as \"a small added measure given by milkmen, shopkeepers, etc., to their customers.\" Terence Patrick Dolan's A Dictionary of Hiberno-English (Gill and Macmillan, 1998) supplies a similar definition: \"a small amount added to anything as a token gift or for good measure, especially by milkmen.\" Dolan supplies the example of a seller from Cork who \"always gave a tuille with a pint of milk.\""

  "010143timeenough": {
    "note": " The old milkwoman of Telemachus lives by a very relaxed sense of time, expressed in her careless assurance that there is \"time enough\" for the tower residents to pay their bill. Joyce shows here the fast-paced rhythm of modern urban existence, embodied especially in the Englishman, meeting the slow-moving world of rural Ireland.",
    "expandedNote": " Haines points out that “We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn’t we?” To the old woman, “the bill” is something that can be settled now or at some later date. She was probably not going to mention it, even though it has been accumulating every day for ten days, and when Mulligan comes up with a coin to settle most of the tab (prompted by Haines’ exhortation to “Pay up and look pleasant”), the hand in which she receives the florin is “uneager.” To Stephen’s assurance that “We’ll owe twopence,” she says calmly, “Time enough, sir . . . Time enough.”\n The gap between rural Ireland and the frenetic modern world has no doubt narrowed since the publication of Ulysses, but it remains. Eric Cross' 1942 portrait of The Tailor shows a man \"prodigal of time,\" whose favorite saying is \"Glac bog an saoghal agus glacfaidh an saoghal bog tú: Take the world fine and aisy and the world will take you fine and aisy\" (13-14). Even in the era of the European Union time moves slower in this magical country, as Tony Hawks’ 1998 travelogue Round Ireland with a fridge (1998) makes hilariously clear."

  "030078tinkers": {
    "note": " For several paragraphs in Proteus, Stephen watches \"A woman and a man\" and \"Their dog,\" who have walked out onto the sands not far from him. They are \"Cocklepickers,\" out to harvest seafood. But before long he is calling them \"Red Egyptians,\" or gypsies. These may be Romani people, in Ireland also called \"tinkers\" or, their preferred names, Travellers or Pavees. But it seems possible that Stephen may simply be imagining them as gypsies or tinkers, based on their skin color or other details of their appearance. He takes an interest in them chiefly for the ethnic jargon, often called \"cant,\" that he imagines these people speaking.",
    "expandedNote": " Romani in various places and times have been called gypsies, reflecting an assumption that they originated in Egypt. The assumption is false: scholars have determined that the travelers came originally from north India. A small population of these people have lived in Ireland since the early 19th century. They speak English mixed with some non-standard words, in patois dialects called cants. \n Cant seems to have developed partly as a cryptolect, to keep outsiders from understanding what insiders are saying to one another. Cockney speech in London is another such cryptolect. Its rhyming slang—e.g., using \"trouble\" as an expression for \"wife\" by derivation from the rhyming phrase \"trouble and strife\"— reportedly developed as a way to elude police scrutiny. As Stephen contemplates the couple on the beach he thinks of cant words used in England in the 17th century by the criminal underclass. This language is often referred to as \"thieves' cant\" or \"rogues' cant,\" but much of it apparently derived from the talk of English gypsies. \n In The Canting Academy (1673), the work from which Stephen draws many of his words (and four lines of memorable poetry), Richard Head wrote: \"The principal Professors of this Gibberish or Canting, I find, are a sort of People which are vulgarly called Gypsies; and they do endeavour to perswade the ignorant, that they were extracted from the Egyptians . . . they artificially discolour their faces, and with this tawny hew and tatterdemallion habit, they rove up and down the Country, and with the pretension of wonderful prediction, delude a many of the younger and less intelligent people\" (2). \n Travellers are mentioned again in Cyclops, when the Citizen uses their name figuratively, and disparagingly, to inquire about a meeting: \"What did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide about the Irish language?\" Gifford notes that \"tinkers, like Gypsies, were notorious for indigence, for cunning and thievery, and for a shiftless, nomadic way of life.\" \n The Romani are mentioned in Oxen of the Sun, in a more English context. In an 18th century prose style reminiscent of Defoe, Frank Costello is described as having consorted with gypsies: \"One time he would be a playactor, then a sutler or a welsher, then nought would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main, then he was for the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the Romany folk, kidnapping a squire's heir by favour or moonlight or fecking maid's linen or choking chickens behind a hedge.\""

Tit-Bits was a weekly British magazine founded by the publisher George Newnes, first issued in October 1881. It pioneered modern forms of popular, low-brow journalism, but despite the suggestive title and some sensational elements it was not in the least pornographic. (Photo Bits, on the other hand, certainly was.) Bloom reads a fictional story in the magazine and wishes that he too could publish a story there—as did James Joyce.",
    "expandedNote": " Much later, starting in 1939 and continuing for many decades,Tit-Bits covers often featured pin-up photographs of beautiful women in scanty clothing that revealed bountiful breasts. It seems likely that Victorian and Edwardian male readers would have heard a pun in the magazine's name. As a word for nipple or breast, \"tit\" is quite old, and Molly thinks of it in Penelope: \"yes I think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he made me thirstytitties he calls them I had to laugh yes this one anyhow stiff the nipple gets for the least thing.\" But a tit-bit or tid-bit was a tasty morsel of food, the sense that Stephen has in mind in Proteus when he thinks of minnows becoming \"fat of a spongy titbit\" after chewing on the drowned man's corpse.\n According to the lead column in the first issue, the magazine's tasty morsels consisted of \"extracts\" from \"the most interesting papers and books\" to be found around the world. The purpose was to entertain as much as to inform: the reader would encounter \"interesting incidents, amusing anedcotes, pithy paragraphs,\" and he would acquire \"a stock of smart sayings and a fund of anecdotes which will make his society agreeable.\" The magazine was designed to reach a mass audience, much of which (as Arthur Conan Doyle observed) had only become literate after passage of the Elementary Education Act in 1870. Many of its articles were only a paragraph long, it was printed on cheap paper, and it sold for one penny. Jokes were its chief draw. Kelly Mays observes that by the time represented in Ulysses it had grown to a circulation of over a million copies a week in Britain alone (\"The Publishing World,\" in A Companion to the Victorian Novel, ed. Patrick Brantlinger and William B. Thesing [Blackwell, 2002], 23). \n But in addition to its extracts from other publications the paper also published new fiction starting in 1889, and it sponsored well-paying competitions to attract good writers. P. G. Wodehouse published an early humorous piece, \"Men Who Missed Their Own Weddings,\" in the magazine in November 1900. Joseph Conrad, Virginia Woolf, and D. H. Lawrence all submitted stories. The issue that Bloom reads on the toilet features \"Our prize titbit: Matcham's Masterstroke. Written by Mr Philip Beaufoy, Playgoers' Club, London. Payment at the rate of one guinea a column has been made to the writer. Three and a half. Three pounds three. Three pounds, thirteen and six.\" \n In Calypso, kindly envying Mr. Beaufoy his handsome remuneration, Bloom thinks that he too \"Might manage a sketch,\" perhaps inventing a story to illustrate \"some proverb,\" using bits of his wife's conversation. In Nausicaa, having just seen a \"nobleman\" passing by, he thinks that he could write a \"prize titbit story\" called The Mystery Man on the Beach, or maybe instead one on \"that fellow today at the graveside in the brown macintosh.\" In Eumaeus he wonders whether he could \"meet with anything approaching the same luck as Mr Philip Beaufoy\" if he wrote down My Experiences in a Cabman's Shelter. \n Emulation of Philip Beaufoy runs through all these meditations, and in Circe Bloom is put on trial as \"A plagiarist. A soapy sneak masquerading as a literateur. It's perfectly obvious that with the most inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling copy, really gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath suspicion. The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions, with which your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout the kingdom.\" \n All this literary self-referentiality is capped by the supreme joke that Mr. Beaufoy is himself a plagiarist: his Matcham's Masterstroke borrows from a silly story that Joyce, hoping to win a prize, submitted to Tit-Bits when he was a student at Belvedere College in his middle teens, in the late 1890s. In My Brother's Keeper, Stanislaus Joyce remarks that \"'ThatTitbits paper' was the only one my father used to read for general culture\" (92). Jim apparently wrote his story mostly as a joke, but like Bloom he would have been happy to receive payment for it."

    "note": " The 1st section of Wandering Rocks, like the final one, depicts a long journey. At 2:55 PM the Reverend John Conmee looks at his watch and reflects that it is a good time to \"walk to Artane,\" a northeastern suburb beyond Clontarf and Killester. This trip of well over two miles, only a bit more than half of which he will undertake on foot, leads to the O'Brien Institute for Destitute Children, which housed and fed orphan boys and gave them a Christian Brothers education. There, at the request of Martin Cunningham, the priest hopes to secure a place for Paddy Dignam's fatherless son by speaking to \"Brother Swan,\" the Director of the institute.",
    "expandedNote": " Father Conmee became Superior of the community of priests and nuns at St. Francis Xavier's church in 1898. Just as he acted on the behalf of John Stanislaus Joyce to see that James and Stanislaus would be educated without charge at Belvedere College, sparing them from the ignominy of a Christian Brothers education, Wandering Rocks finds him acting to see that Patsy Dignam will have a decent free education from the Christian Brothers. Many of the places that his fictive persona passes on his walk in the 1st section, and some of the people he meets, had strong personal connections to Joyce. \n After descending the steps of the presbytery, Father Conmee walks to the western corner of \"Mountjoy Square,\" a small park one block southeast of his church, and then proceeds to skirt half of the park's perimeter. Walking by \"the treeshade of sunnywinking leaves\" on the northwest edge of the park, he crosses paths with \"the wife of Mr David Sheehy M.P.\" and then, at \"the corner of Mountjoy Square\" (the northern one), he meets \"three little schoolboys\" who are receiving a Jesuit education at Belvedere. He gives one of them a letter to post in \"the red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street,\" just across the street. (If the mailbox still existed—it does not—it would now be painted green.) In addition to the boys' association with Belvedere, Joyce would have felt personal attachment to Fitzgibbon Street. As Robert Nicholson notes in The Ulysses Guide, his family moved there from Blackrock in 1892; \"their house at No. 14 on the right is now No. 34\" (75).\n Turning right at the corner rather than proceeding up Fitzgibbon Street to the North Circular Road, Father Conmee walks along the park railings on \"Mountjoy square east,\" the street that fronts the northeastern edge of the park. There, he greets \"Mrs M'Guinness\" who is walking on \"the farther footpath\" on the other side of the street. After reaching the eastern corner of the park, diametrically opposite the one where he began, he turns left on \"Great Charles street,\" heading northeast. \n Glancing at \"the shutup free church on his left,\" he sees notice of a sermon to be delivered by the \"incumbent\" minister, which Gifford glosses as \"the minister in charge.\" The church, Gifford notes, is shut up \"in that it is not open for prayer, as a Catholic church would be.\" Designed by architect Edward Robbins, it was built by Methodists in 1800 and originally called the Wesley Chapel. Some two decades later it was transferred to the Church of Ireland and functioned for many years as a \"free church,\" which, according to the site Archiseek.com, is \"one where no pew debts are paid,\" relying entirely on \"voluntary subscription.\" The Free Church closed in 1988, and the building now houses the shutup Pavee Point Traveller and Roma Centre.\n Soon after passing this building, Father Conmee reaches the major thoroughfare regarded in 1904 as the northern boundary of Dublin. At the end of Great Charles Street he turns right \"and walked along the North Circular road. It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an important thoroughfare. Surely, there ought to be.\" Possibly the priest's legs are suggesting to him that he has chosen too long a journey to undertake entirely on foot. The North Circular Road passes by North \"Richmond street,\" the grim cul de sac in which the protagonist of \"Araby,\" the third story of Dubliners, lives. The Joyce family lived there too, and in 1893 James attended the Christian Brothers school that Daniel O'Connell founded on the street in 1828. Joyce's fictions never directly acknowledge those facts, but here the narrative shows Father Conmee greeting some \"Christian brother boys\" crossing over the North Circular Road from North Richmond.\n Angling slightly to the right, the North Circular Road becomes Portland Row. Although this takes him a bit out of his way (southeast rather than northeast), Father Conmee walks along it for some way, perhaps because he is hoping to catch one of the trams that ran up Amiens Street from the Amiens (now Connolly) Station in 1904, just as various bus lines do today.\n \"Father Conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked.Saint Joseph's church, Portland row. For aged and virtuous females. Father Conmee raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament. Virtuous: but occasionally they were also badtempered.\" There are two Catholic institutions here, a church and an Asylum for Aged and Virtuous Single Women. In 1836, devoted layman James Murphy founded an \"Asylum for aged single females of unblemished character,\" and in 1891 the Archbishop opened a large new building for its use. At the time depicted in the novel, an order of nuns called Poor Servants of the Mother of God would have tended to the needs of the elderly single women in the hostel. For more on Murphy and the history of the institution, see M. R., \"The Founder of St. Joseph's Asylum, Dublin,\" The Irish Monthly 25 (1897): 543-47. Today the nursing home is gone and the building that once housed it has become part of the Dublin Institute of Technology.\n A little farther down Portland Row, \"Near Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift nobleman. And now it was an office or something.\" Edward Stafford, 2nd Earl of Aldborough, an Irish peer who according to Gifford \"already had town houses in Dublin and London and country houses in England and Ireland,\" had this house built in the 1790s \"in what was then the country. . . . This monumental extravagance was compounded by his wife's refusal to live in the house because she did not like its location.\" Extravagant waste though it was, the house is architecturally notable as the last great Irish work of Palladian architecture of the 18th century, and the last great townhouse built in Dublin. After Leinster House, it was the second-biggest Georgian private home in the metropolitan area.\n Stafford died in 1801 and the house sat uninhabited for the next twelve years. A former Cistercian monk, Gregor von Feinaigle (source of the word \"finagle,\" which indicates something of his methods), bought it in 1813 and converted it into a school, which did not last past 1830. At some point in the 1840s it became a military barracks. In the second half of the 19th century it was acquired by the Post Office for use by the Stores Department and it continued in this role until 1999, losing its gardens to Corporation housing projects in the 1940s. For most of the 21st century it has been disused, vandalized, and decaying, with significant water damage from thieves stealing the lead that sealed the roof. During the Celtic Tiger years, a series of developers bought the building but failed to realize their plans to renovate it. Plans are now underway to reclaim its function as an office building, adding modern glassed-in wings on either side.\n Father Conmee now turns left and heads up the \"North Strand road,\" which continues Amiens Street to the northeast. There, the residential tenor of his walk turns commercial. He passes \"Mr William Gallagher,\" a grocer and coal merchant, \"Grogan's the Tobacconist,\" \"Daniel Bergin's publichouse,\" \"H. J. O'Neill's funeral establishment,\" and \"Youkstetter's, the porkbutcher's,\" exchanging salutations all along the way. Every one of these businesses has disappeared. Nicholson notes that \"Bergin's and Youkstetter's vanished suddenly one night when a German bomber crew mistook Ireland for Britain (the human victims are commemorated in a memorial garden nearby). The buildings have since been replaced by Corporation housing, as was H. J. O'Neill's funeral establishment, across the road at No. 164\" (76). \n Approaching the Royal Canal on the North Strand Road, Father Conmee sees a turfbarge \"Moored under the trees of Charleville Mall,\" a short quay-like street running along the edge of the canal on the northwestern side of the small \"Newcomen Bridge.\" The road passes over the canal via this bridge, and on it Father Conmee \"stepped on to an outward bound tram,\" because \"he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island.\" Mud Island, known earlier as Friend's Field or French Field, was the name from the late 18th century onward for the muddy expanse in the area where the River Tolka flows into Dublin Bay—the \"North Strand\" of the road's name. By 1904 some projects had already begun to reclaim these tide flats for urban use, and in the 1920s a large new swath of dry land became the attractively landscaped Fairview Park that fronts the bay today. The Joyce family lived in several different houses in the Fairview area, hard by a muddy beach rather than precious parkland. \n Father Conmee continues riding the tram up the North Strand Road and over the \"Annesley Bridge,\" where it crosses the River Tolka. He gets off at \"the Howth road stop,\" which today would be very close to the Clontarf stop on the DART line. Here, Nicholson notes, he would be \"within view of 15 Marino Crescent, home of Bram Stoker\" (77). From this point on the southwestern edge of Clontarf, there is not only a Howth Road leading east-northeast to the Howth peninsula but also a Malahide Road leading north-northeast to the village of Malahide. Father Conmee begins walking up \"The Malahide road,\" thinking about the \"road and name,\" and the port, and the famous castle and its Talbot lords and ladies. Walking along this road, he encounters a \"flushed young man\" and a young woman with a twig caught in her light skirt. They turn out much later to have been Stephen's friend Lynch and his girlfriend, engaged in fornication in the bushes.\n The section ends here, but presumably Father Conmee's legs carry him the rest of the way up the Malahide Road past Griffith Avenue to a small country lane that leads first to the Marino Casino, a lovely 18th century folly designed by Scottish architect William Chambers for the 1st Earl of Charlemont, and then to the O'Brien Institute. Today the large building houses the Dublin Fire Brigade Training Centre, while the Marino Casino has become a popular tourist destination."

    "note": " As Stephen imagines the gypsy couple walking \"Across the sands of all the world,\" he imbues them with qualities of lyric revery. They are \"followed by the sun's flaming sword,\" suggesting the angelic guard placed at the gates of Eden after the first couple's fall from grace. They also move \"to the west, trekking to evening lands,\" the language now evoking Percy Bysshe Shelley's closet drama Hellas (1821), which envisions the journey west from Turkey to Greece as a dawning of universal hope—a kind of recovery of Eden.",
    "expandedNote": " Genesis describes how God expelled Adam and Eve from the garden in which they had transgressed his command: \"So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life\" (3:24).\n Shelley's Hellas is set during the war for Greek independence. It centers on the Ottoman sultan, Mahmud, who is achieving victories over the Greek revolutionaries but is troubled by a recurring nightmare that his cause is futile. Between the speaking parts, a chorus of \"Greek captive women\" sing, and near the end of the drama they envision the end of war, the liberation of Greece, and the renewal of the world's Golden Age:\n If Greece must be\n A wreck, yet shall its fragments reassemble,\n And build themselves again impregnably\n In a diviner clime . . . \n Darkness has dawned in the East\n On the noon of time:\n The death-birds descend to their feast\n From the hungry clime.\n Let Freedom and Peace flee far\n To a sunnier strand,\n And follow Love's folding-star\n To the Evening land! . . . \n Hesperus flies from awakening night,\n And pants in its beauty and speed with light\n Fast-flashing, soft, and bright.\n Thou beacon of love! thou lamp of the free!\n Guide us far, far away,\n To climes where now veiled by the ardour of day\n Thou art hidden\n From waves on which weary Noon\n Faints in her summer swoon,\n Between kingless continents sinless as Eden,\n Around mountains and islands inviolably\n Pranked on the sapphire sea. . . .\n The world’s great age begins anew,\n The golden years return,\n The earth doth like a snake renew\n Her winter weeds outworn:\n Heaven smiles, and faiths and empires gleam,\n Like wrecks of a dissolving dream. (1002-65)\n In the final lines of Shelley's play, as the Chorus foresee \"A brighter Hellas\" renewing its glorious past, they proclaim that \"A new Ulysses leaves once more / Calypso for his native shore\" (1066, 1076-77). The entire play, then, sees the movement west from Turkey to Greece as a homecoming, a return from exile. Stephen's sentence strikes similar notes: the gypsies walking west, away from the sun's \"flaming sword\" but toward \"evening lands,\" simultaneously embody the despair of exile and the hope of homecoming. \n At the end of Proteus, Stephen consoles himself by thinking that his own life's journey is moving \"To evening lands. Evening will find itself.\" Pragmatically, he may be supposing that he will find a bed to sleep in on the morning of June 17. More ambitiously, he may be hoping that his apostasy will find its spiritual justification in a work of Hellenic beauty."

    "note": " When Bloom has collected his letter from the post office on Westland Row, the narrative observes that \"He strolled out of the postoffice and turned to the right.\" This detail would be unremarkable were it not that, after three more right turns and a detour through a church, he ends up almost exactly where he started—and then turns left. His meandering steps, circling back on themselves, describe the beginning of a second giant question mark. Scholars have uncovered this pattern, suggestive of extreme distraction and aimlessness, but for the casual reader it is buried beneath a sea of textual details.",
    "expandedNote": " Turning right at the post office door means that Bloom is traveling north along Westland Row, retracing the steps he took a few minutes earlier albeit now on the east side of the street. After an extended conversation with the annoying M'Coy (approximately three pages of text in most editions), he begins \"strolling towards Brunswick street\" (today called Pearse Street), which runs east-west. We hear that \"Mr Bloom stood at the corner, his eyes wandering\" over various advertising posters.\n After several paragraphs of reflections on stage plays, prompted by the posters, the text reveals that \"Mr Bloom went round the corner and passed the drooping nags of the hazard.\" He is now moving east on Great Brunswick Street, passing just north of the train station where cabs pick up and drop off railway passengers, and thinking, inevitably, about the lives of horses. He passes thecabmen's shelter, and thinks about their lives too: \"Curious the life of drifting cabbies. All weathers, all places, time or setdown, no will of their own.\"\n And now Bloom comes to still another street, and turns into it as if he has no will of his own: \"He turned into Cumberland street and, going on some paces, halted in the lee of the station wall.\" South Cumberland Street runs parallel to Westland Row, one block east. Standing in the quiet \"lee\" of the railway station, sheltered from the noisy comings and goings on Brunswick, he looks at \"Meade's timberyard\" across the street (shown as \"Saw Mill\" on the Thom's map featured here), checks to make sure that no one is nearby, and then reads Martha's letter. Thinking about the letter occupies him for another two pages.\n A new feature of the cityscape ushers in a new series of reflections. South Cumberland Street passes under the railway station by means of a wide stone arch topped by a maze of timber trusses that support the tracks above. As Bloom passes through this short, dank urban tunnel he takes advantage of the darkness and isolation to destroy the evidence of his correspondent's identity: \"Going under the railway arch he took out the envelope, tore it swiftly in shreds and scattered them towards the road.\" As the shreds flutter and sink, he thinks of tearing up checks, and of a Guinness family member cashing a huge check, and how much porter you'd have to sell to make that kind of money.\n \"He had reached the open backdoor of All Hallows,\" the church whose front entrance is on Westland Row. \"Stepping into the porch,\" Bloom completes a final right turn pointing him back in the direction of Westland Row. After four more pages spent thinking about Catholic religious practices in the church, he passes \"out through the main door into the light.\" He is now only a few steps from where he began when he left the post office. And, heading off in an entirely new direction, \"He walked southward along Westland row.\"\n These meanderings speak volumes about Bloom's state of mind, but Joyce does not make it easy to notice them. He calls no attention to the larger shape that his minute spatial directions are tracing, and he scatters those details across many pages of text. From the moment when Bloom steps out of the post office (line 76 in Gabler's text) to the moment when he emerges from the church (line 458), fully two thirds of the chapter elapse (383 of 572 lines), and those pages are filled with thoughts and experiences far more likely to engage a reader's attention.\n Left to their own devices, few readers will pay close attention to the brief stage directions describing Bloom's movements, and unless they are intimately familiar with Dublin's streets they certainly will not realize that he is literally walking in a circle. But such is the nature of Joyce's fiction that attention to tiny things can reveal the largest kinds of design. Like the eaters of Homer's lotos plant, Bloom seems in this chapter to have lost his way.\n Charting Bloom's course from the bird's-eye perspective of a city map yields a vivid illustration of the questions that this long section of the chapter raises about his state of mind."

  "060006toadeyes": {
    "note": " Of the many strange narrative devices in Ulysses, one of the strangest is a convention-violating interplay between the thoughts and words of the third-person narrator and those of the characters. In several of the novel's chapters, Joyce experiments with breaking down the wall of expectations segregating the teller of the tale from those whose stories he tells.",
    "expandedNote": " In The Odyssey of Style in Ulysses (Princeton, 1981), Karen Lawrence notes an odd sympathy between Bloom and the narrator of Hades (50). The narrator describes the priest in the mortuary chapel as balancing a book \"against his toad's belly.\" Bloom's interior monologue then intrudes: \"Who'll read the book? I, said the rook.\" It seems odd, though Lawrence does not make anything of it, that Bloom recalls these lines from the Cock Robin nursery rhyme, about a bird who plays a parson, immediately after the narrator uses an animal metaphor to describe the priest. Is the connection coincidental? In the next line, the narrator continues the animal metaphors by saying that the priest \"began to read out of his book with a fluent croak.\" Bloom responds with more animal metaphors, again not conclusive enough for Lawrence to mention: \"Bully about the muzzle he looks. . . . Burst sideways like a sheep in clover Dedalus says he will. With a belly on him like a poisoned pup.\" But finally, several sentences later, Bloom responds specifically to the image of a toad's belly: \"Eyes of a toad too. What swells him up that way?\" It seems that Bloom has been listening to the narration.\n Characters are not supposed to be aware of things that the narrator is saying. If they gain such awareness (as in Marvell's Upon Appleton House, when the mowers respond to one of the narrator's similes by exclaiming, \"he called us Israelites\"), the foundations of the fiction threaten to crumble. Narrators are allowed more knowledge: they can quote the speech of their characters, describe the contents of their minds, and approximate those mental contents through free indirect discourse. But no matter how omniscient or reliable the narrator's insights, he or she is not normally supposed to carry on dialogue with the character. When this convention is broken, it often happens outside the frame of the fiction, as when Thackeray wafts a parting benediction to Amelia at the end of Vanity Fair: \"Grow green again, tender little parasite.\"\n Beginning in Scylla and Charybdis, Joyce has his narrator snatch and redeploy characters' words, much as Bloom seems to meditate on the narrator's words in Hades. Lawrence notes an example. Stephen says, \"A man of genius makes no mistakes. His errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery.\" Parodically, the poet's phrase then becomes part of a narrative sentence that sounds more than faintly mocking: \"Portals of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian.\" Scylla and Charybdis frequently creates such effects, and two chapters later, in Sirens, the narrative voice is constantly being infected by the words of the characters.\n The most bizarre and complex of these effects in Sirens occurs when the two barmaids explode in bursts of derisive laughter about \"that old fogey in Boyd's,\" who sold Miss Douce some lotion for her skin. The two women excoriate the \"hideous old wretch,\" imagining how awful it would be to be married to his \"greasy eyes,\" his \"bit of beard,\" and his \"greasy nose,\" and when they finally desist in exhaustion, the narrator muses, \"Married to Bloom, to greaseaseabloom.\" Bloom, still walking the streets, has not yet arrived at the Ormond. The barmaids cannot possibly be talking about him. Has the narrator then become so solicitous toward poor soon-to-be-cuckolded Bloom that he responds to the barmaids' speech defensively and tenderly, imagining that they are deriding his protagonist? Whatever the psychology behind the transfer, the narrator has used the barmaids' words to give his protagonist a new name, as is emphasized several sentences later: \"By Cantwell's offices roved Greaseabloom, by Ceppi's virgins, bright of their oils. Nannetti's father hawked those things about, wheedling at doors as I.\""

  "100002tobacco": {
    "note": " In addition to being bathed in alcohol, Ulysses is suffused with the smell of tobacco. Cigarettes figure prominently in the book, backed by briefer appearances from pipes, cigars, chewing tobacco, and snuff. As with alcohol, Bloom does not abstain totally, but he does resist the pull of this addictive substance, pondering its health effects as a \"poison.\"",
    "expandedNote": " Pipes had been the chief vehicle for smoking in the 19th century. Simon Dedalus smokes one in Sirens, Bloom remembers his father smoking one in Oxen of the Sun, Molly remembers the same of her father in Penelope, and in Circe a fantasized Bloom smokes a peasant's cheap clay pipe. But times changed with the arrival of machines for rolling cigarettes in the 1880s. The newfangled smoking sticks were catching on in a big way by the turn of the century, and by 1920 the \"swaggerroot\" (Zoe's fanciful coinage in Circe) had largely supplanted pipes. \n People offer cigarettes to one another in Telemachus,Aeolus, and Circe, and in Lotus Eaters Bloom thinks about the companionly comfort of the habit as he passes by the drivers at the cabstand: \"Like to give them an odd cigarette. Sociable.\" Smokers seem to relish lighting up in restaurants even more than in pubs. Kevin Egan \"rolls gunpowder cigarettes\" as he sits in a Paris café in Proteus,and in Lestrygonians Bloom inhales \"sweetish warmish cigarette smoke\" and \"reek of plug\" in the Burton. \n Women enjoy the weed equally with men. Gerty MacDowell thinks of \"the nice perfume of those good cigarettes\" that Reggie Wylie smokes, and she remembers the night when Cissy Caffrey \"dressed up in her father’s suit and hat and the burned cork moustache and walked down Tritonville road, smoking a cigarette.\" As Bloom walks through the streets of the Monto he sees prostitutes smoking in doorways and open windows. Their \"birdseye cigarettes\" cohere with the hundreds of animal transformations in this chapter, but birdseye was a technique for cutting tobacco leaves across the central stem, giving a distinctive appearance to the strips.\n When Bloom gets home he sees that Molly and Blazes Boylan have been smoking cigarettes at the piano, and when Molly imagines her husband bringing Stephen to the house she thinks \"we can have music and cigarettes I can accompany him.\" Ithaca observes that in the Blooms' bedroom the odor of \"Muratti's Turkish cigarettes\" hangs about Molly's clothes. In Penelope she recalls smelling cigarette smoke in one of Milly's dresses. \n Among other retail outlets, many specialized smoke shops catered to Dubliners' tobacco needs. In Wandering Rocks Father Conmee walks past \"Grogan's the Tobacconist\" on North Strand Road, and in Lestrygonians Bloom thinks of \"Tobaccoshopgirls.\" Numerous Irish entrepreneurs at this time went into the business of manufacturing tobacco products. In an article titled \"The Production and Consumption of Tobacco in Ireland, 1800-1914,\" in Irish Economic and Social History 25 (1998): 1-21, Andy Bielenberg and David Johnson document that \"At the time of the 1907 census of production, tobacco manufacturing was one of Ireland's largest industries,\" even though the country imported nearly all of its leaves (1). \n (In Eumaeus the patriotic proprietor of the cabman's shelter declares confidence in Ireland's ability to grow even warm-weather crops: \"You could grow any mortal thing in Irish soil, he stated, and there was that colonel Everard down there in Navan growing tobacco.\" Gifford notes that \"Navan was a small market town in County Meath, twenty-eight miles northwest of Dublin. Col. N. T. Everard was a gentleman farmer who in 1904 was conducting what he regarded as a successful twenty-acre experiment in tobacco growing.\" Such aspirations notwithstanding, the climate in Ireland is not conducive to growing top-quality tobacco plants.) \n Amid the wave of enthusiasm for tobacco Bloom displays his characteristic skepticism. The cigar that he reluctantly accepts in Cyclops is a defense not only against being \"treated\" to countless alcoholic drinks but also, it seems, against the omnipresent consumption of cigarettes. When Zoe tries to bum a cigarette off of him, he replies, \"Rarely smoke, dear. Cigar now and then. Childish device. (Lewdly.) The mouth can be better engaged than with a cylinder of rank weed.\" He then launches into a denunciation of Sir Walter Ralegh for bringing to Europe \"a poisoner of the ear, eye, heart, memory, will, understanding, all.\" \n Bloom clearly believes that tobacco may affect the body in harmful ways. When he sees a desperately poor boy \"smoking a chewed fagbutt\" in Lotus Eaters he thinks of telling him that \"if he smokes he won't grow.\" He seems also to believe that the stuff may have deranging mental effects. In Lotus Eaters these appear to him under a pleasant guise—\"Cigar has a cooling effect. Narcotic\"—but in Eumaeus he tells the incapacitated Stephen that \"it wouldn’t occasion me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in your drink for some ulterior object.\" The drug seems to lodge in his imagination as a dangerous pleasure, as treacherously seductive as sex:\n (Gaudy dollwomen loll in the lighted doorways, in window embrasures, smoking birdseye cigarettes. The odour of the sicksweet weed floats towards him in slow round ovalling wreaths.)\n THE WREATHS\nSweet are the sweets. Sweets of sin."

Jack Power, Charley M'Coy, and Martin Cunningham are aware that \"Mr Kernan came of Protestant stock and, though he had been converted to the Catholic faith at the time of his marriage, he had not been in the pale of the Church for twenty years. He was fond, moreover, of giving side-thrusts at Catholicism.\" To encourage compliance, they sing the praises of the Jesuit priest who will be conducting the service, and of the Catholic church more generally. \n Many withering ironies attend this campaign, not least of them the campaigners' assurances that the retreat is \"for business men,\" and that Father Purdon is \"a man of the world like ourselves.\" Sure enough, the good father's sermon concerns the exceedingly strange biblical text, Luke 16:8-9, in which Jesus says that the children of this world are wiser than the children of light, commanding his followers to \"make unto yourselves friends of the mammon of iniquity.\" This passage, the priest says, is \"a text for business men and professional men,\" offering help to \"those whose lot it was to lead the life of the world.\" As Father Purdon preaches, a \"speck of red light\" burns over the altar in the Saint Francis Xavier church, signifying the presence of the Blessed Sacrament in the tabernacle. Purdon Street ran through Dublin's red-light district, the Monto. The book's theme of simony sounds very strongly here.\n Tom Kernan is indeed a man of business: he tastes and sells tea. In Lotus Eaters, Bloom thinks of \"Tea. Must get some from Tom Kernan. Couldn't ask him at a funeral, though.\" Wandering Rocks notes, and Ithaca confirms, that he works as an \"agent for Pulbrook, Robertson and Co, 2 Mincing Lane, London, E. C., 5 Dame street, Dublin).\" But the businessman's retreat has not made \"a new man\" of Mr. Kernan: his alcoholic habit remains intact. In Wandering Rocks, he complacently ponders having just booked a sale with a pub owner by chatting him up and giving him some business: \"I'll just take a thimbleful of your best gin, Mr Crimmins. A small gin, sir. Yes, sir. . . . And now, Mr Crimmins, may we have the honour of your custom again, sir. The cup that cheers but not inebriates, as the old saying has it.\" \n Nor has Kernan reformed in the second way envisioned by his friends, by burrowing deep into the bosom of Mother Church. InHades he seeks out Bloom, a man who like himself is nominally Catholic but privately skeptical, to remark that the priest in Prospect Cemetery has recited the words of the funeral service too quickly. Kernan adds that he finds the language of \"the Irish church\" (the state-sponsored Protestant religion) to be \"simpler, more impressive I must say.\" The side-thrusts continue.\n Finally, it also becomes clear that Kernan has experienced no sudden conversion regarding business ethics. In \"Grace,\" his wife says she has nothing to offer the gentleman visitors and offers to \"send round to Fogarty's at the corner.\" Fogarty is \"a modest grocer\" whose shop also sells alcoholic beverages, in the Irish tradition of the spirit-grocer. \"He had failed in business in a licensed house in the city,\" because his lack of money kept him from buying top-drawer products. Later in the story, this struggling small businessman shows up at the Kernans' house when Cunningham, Power, and M'Coy are visiting, handsomely bringing with him \"a half-pint of special whiskey\" to console Mr. Kernan on his accident. We learn that \"Mr Kernan appreciated the gift all the more since he was aware that there was a small account for groceries unsettled between him and Mr Fogarty.\" \n In Hades, Mr. Power says, \"I wonder how is our friend Fogarty getting on.\" \"Better ask Tom Kernan,\" says Mr. Dedalus. \"How is that?\" Martin Cunningham asks. \"Left him weeping, I suppose?\" \"Though lost to sight,\" Simon replies, \"to memory dear.\" Mr. Kernan, in other words, has continued not paying the grocer what he owes him, and is now so far in arrears that he stealthily avoids meeting him. This detail of Kernan's shabby financial dealings, together with his unreformed drinking and his unchanged religious loyalties, bears out what Mrs. Kernan thinks in \"Grace\": \"After a quarter of a century of married life she had very few illusions left. Religion for her was a habit and she suspected that a man of her husband's age would not change greatly before death.\" \n One final detail carries over from the story to the novel, subtly suggesting the salesman's slow alcoholic decline from respectability. \"Grace\" notes his reliance on a good appearance: \"Mr Kernan was a commercial traveller of the old school which believed in the dignity of its calling. He had never been seen in the city without a silk hat of some decency and a pair of gaiters. By grace of these two articles of clothing, he said, a man could always pass muster.\" In Ulysseshe is still banking on this saving \"grace,\" though one detail suggests it may be wearing thin. After leaving Mr. Crimmins' establishment, he stands looking at himself in a mirror, thinking complacently of the favorable effect his frockcoat had on the bar owner. It is a \"Stylish coat, beyond a doubt,\" which the tailor, \"Scott of Dawson street,\" could not have sold for \"under three guineas.\" Kernan thinks it was \"Well worth the half sovereign I gave Neary for it. . . . Some Kildare street club toff had it probably. . . . Must dress the character for those fellows. Knight of the road. Gentleman.\" Kernan feels satisfied that he is still dressing up to the standards of his profession, but he is doing it with second-hand clothes. \n In a letter to his friend Constantine Curran, Joyce mentioned \"My father's old friend R. J. Thornton ('Tom Kernan').\" Vivien Igoe affirms that Joyce modeled Kernan principally on this man who was godfather to two of the Joyce children, and who worked as a tea taster and traveling salesman for Pullbrook, Robertson, & Co. She reports that Stanislaus described Thornton as \"an amusing, robust, florid little elderly man,\" and that he died in 1903 in \"a tenement building\" on Upper Mercer Street. This squalid ending reads like an echo of Mrs. Kernan's words in the short story: \"We were waiting for him to come home with the money. He never seems to think he has a home at all.\""

    "note": " Musing on \"Dignam's potted meat,\" Bloom thinks of people who actually do consume human flesh: \"Cannibals would with lemon and rice. White missionary too salty. Like pickled pork.\" His thoughts here draw on a host of 19th century reports of South Seas cannibalism, in places like Fiji, Sumatra, New Guinea, New Zealand, and Australia.",
    "expandedNote": " Gifford calls the \"too salty\" idea a \"Legendary (and quasi-cynical) explanation for the survival of missionaries.\" However legendary some of the stories may be, Bloom is accurately reflecting a number of accounts of Pacific island cannibalism that appeared in the English-language press. On the James Joyce Online Notes website, Harald Beck cites one instance of the idea that cannibals spice human flesh with lemon juice, in a history of Sumatra that was reproduced in an 1814 issue of Evangelism Magazine and Missionary Chronicle: \"When mortally wounded, they run up to him as if in a transport of passion, cut pieces from the body with their knives,—dip them in a dish of salt, lemon-juice, and red pepper,—slightly broil them over a fire prepared for the purpose,—and swallow the morsels with a degree of savage enthusiasm.\" \n Beck identifies numerous sources for the idea that white men's flesh was considered too salty. The Diary of a Working Clergyman in Australia and Tasmania (1859) contains this entry from 1852, which was reproduced in the 30 June 1859 Irish Times: \"This is the first time I could ever get a confession of cannibalism out of a native. I have been told that the blacks cannot endure a white man's flesh. They say that it tastes very salty, and is highly flavoured with tobacco\" (170). The 24 November 1871 New York Times reproduced an account of practices on Fiji from another published source: \"At these disgusting carnivals the bodies of native boys of twelve to fourteen years of age only are eaten. From earliest childhood these subjects are fattened for the horrid feast. . . . The native boy flesh is for the palates of the Chiefs only. That of the white man is considered too salty and smoky, and is not regarded as toothsome.\" \n Such reports continued into the 1880s, when Bloom was a young man, although Beck does not cite any published in Ireland. The 1887-88 Transactions of the Annual Meetings of the Kansas Academy of Science published a report by Joseph Savage called \"The Pink and White Terraces of New Zealand,\" containing the following: \"Mr. Snow called a congress of these ex-cannibals, and they told him of their former ways of living, killing their enemies and afterwards eating them; all of which we will omit, except this: That white men and sliced missionary were too salty for their taste.\" \n The Pall Mall Gazette of 10 September 1889 printed a story under the headline “Among the Man-Eaters of North Queensland,” which noted that \"when you call them cannibals you must remember that human flesh is a very rare luxury, for they only eat foreign tribes. Native tribes, I mean, for the flesh of the white man is nasty to their palate. He has a salty flavour, which is very disagreeable to them.\" The same article continues: \"I never saw a cannibal feast, but every night in their huts the talk was of women and human flesh. . . . I gathered that white man was no good – too salty. Chinaman was not half bad. He fed on rice and had a tender vegetable flavour about him, like a mealy cauliflower. But of all varieties there was nothing so sweet as a native baby – so sweet, so juicy, so fat so tender.\"\n It is probably impossible to determine the veracity of the reports of aversion to white flesh, but much of the surrounding context is clearly factual: cannibalism was indisputably practiced by many tribes in the region, dozens of European missionaries were killed by hostile natives, and some of them were eaten. (In 2009, near Rabaul, tribesmen on the island of New Britain formally apologized to Fiji's high commissioner to Papua New Guinea for their Tolai ancestors' killing and eating of four British missionaries in 1878.) Victorian newspapers regularly titillated their readers with reports of cannibalism in the South Seas, particularly in the Fiji islands, which were known as the Cannibal Isles. Bloom seems not to be indulging in \"legend\" so much as reflecting on what his culture \"knew\" about life in the South Seas."

    "note": " At the beginning of Telemachus, Stephen has pondered \"Mulligan's even white teeth, glistening here and there with gold points.\" At the end of the chapter, Mulligan turns his \"hyperborean\" flattery of Stephen to mockery: \"Toothless Kinch and I, the supermen.\" Stephen too will think of his decaying teeth, at the end of Proteus: “My teeth are very bad. Why, I wonder. Feel. That one is going too. Shells. Ought I go to a dentist, I wonder, with that money? That one. This. Toothless Kinch, the superman.” In these details Joyce was faithfully representing his own condition at the time.",
    "expandedNote": " Ellmann observes in a footnote that, after leaving for the continent with Nora in the autumn of 1904, “In Paris his teeth had been so bad that, when he occasionally yielded to his fondness for onion soup, the hot soup striking his teeth made him writhe in pain” (194). In Pola in early 1905, under Nora’s loving influence, he began to take more care of his physical being: “He put on weight, grew a moustache, and with Nora’s help in curling began to wear his hair en brosse. He felt the first stirrings of dandyism. He went to the dentist as planned, and had some teeth fixed; then he bought a new suit. He rented a piano and sang his songs” (194). \n By having Stephen wonder, on Sandymount Strand where Joyce first walked out with Nora, whether he should go to a dentist and get some teeth fixed, the novel may be obliquely alluding to the beneficent influence of a lover."

    "note": " When Mr. Deasy says to Stephen in Nestor, \"You think me an old fogey and an old tory,\" he sounds the novel's first echo of struggles within the British Parliament to resolve the question of Irish independence. The Conservative party, known as Tories, generally supported the status quo in the 19th century and resisted major social reforms. The most consequential of these for Ireland, and doubtless the subtext of Deasy's taunt, was the push for \"Home Rule\" in the 1870s and 80s.",
    "expandedNote": " After the collapse of the Fenian movement in the 1860s, momentum shifted toward parliamentary action. A group of Irish political activists called the Home Rule league sought to finish O'Connell's work by repealing the Act of Union passed in 1800 and creating a measure of Irish representative self-rule within the United Kingdom, much like the devolved national assemblies in Scotland and Wales today. Home Rule was seen as a centrist course between the extremes of Irish insurrection and British imperialism. It brought together the great Irish parliamentary leader Charles Stewart Parnell and the great English statesman William Ewart Gladstone, who presided over Liberal governments as Prime Minister for many of the years from 1868 to 1894.\n Like English voters, Irish voters elected Liberal and Conservative representatives to Parliament, but starting in the 1870s they also began electing members of what was successively known as the Home Government Association, the Home Rule League, the Nationalist Party, and the Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP), who advocated for self-rule, and Unionists, who opposed it. The former cause proved immensely stronger. In the 1885 elections the IPP won 85 of the 103 Irish seats. \n In April 1886 Gladstone introduced legislation which he had personally and secretively drafted. Called the Government of Ireland Bill or, colloquially, the First Home Rule Bill, it specified the composition and powers of an Irish national assembly. He argued that Parliament could grant home rule to Ireland honorably now, or find itself compelled to do so on humiliating terms later. Parnell had strong reservations about the bill's provisions, but committed to support it. The Unionists and the Orange Lodges voiced bitter opposition. When the measure came to a vote, 93 of Gladstone's 404 Liberal MPs voted Nay, dooming the measure to defeat. Ithaca cryptically records one fictional person's expectations: Bloom's desk drawer contains \"a sealed prophecy (never unsealed) written by Leopold Bloom in 1886 concerning the consequences of the passing into law of William Ewart Gladstone’s Home Rule bill of 1886 (never passed into law).\"\n The setback weakened Gladstone in the elections that were held later in 1886. As for Parnell, the ordeal of his sexual scandal in 1890 fragmented the IPP and crippled the Home Rule movement.\n Mr. Deasy seems to be using \"tory\" as a purported description of himself much as he uses \"fenian\" at the end of the paragraph to characterize Stephen—i.e., as a broad cultural generalization rather than a specific claim of affiliation. Deasy may vote Conservative, but he seems to be raising the possibility that he does not. Stephen and his father Simon may converse with revolutionaries, but both are Parnellites, not bomb-throwers."

  "010009tower": {
    "note": " Joyce lived with Gogarty in \"the tower\" at Sandycove Point, southeast of Dublin, for a few days in September 1904. Telemachus realistically depicts thetop of the tower and the living space one floor below. It also mentions the military history that produced these defensive fortifications. But Joyce chose this dramatic setting as much for its symbolic resonances as for its basis in lived experience: it gave him a way to begin his novel with parallels to Homer's Odyssey and to Shakespeare's Hamlet. Both of these works tell stories of usurpation and revenge, and both center on the powerful visual image of a royal palace.",
    "expandedNote": " Hamlet begins with sentinels meeting on the battlements of Elsinore castle just before daybreak, as Denmark prepares for war with Norway. A ghost appears, to inform Hamlet that there is an internal as well as an external enemy: his uncle Claudius has seized the Danish throne by murdering Hamlet's father. Like Shakespeare’s play, Ulysses begins at daybreak with Stephen and Mulligan meeting on the battlements of a military tower. Stephen is described at one point standing \"at his post\" there. There is no war, but in 1904 Ireland was still very much under British occupation, after the Home Rule movement of the 1880s died with the disgrace and death of the parliamentary leader Charles Stuart Parnell. \n The so-called Martello tower in which the men are living embodies British occupation by virtue of its history and by virtue of the fact that an Englishman is currently living in it with Mulligan and Stephen. Haines later says to Stephen, “I mean to say, . . . this tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore. That beetles o’er his base into the sea, isn’t it?” (Stephen will think of this phrase from Hamlet again in Proteus.) This first episode of Ulysses will also introduce a ghost, in the form of a nightmare that Stephen has had about his mother. And it will liken Mulligan to Claudius in subtle ways, making him the usurper on the inside of the kingdom.\n At the beginning of the Odyssey the palace on Ithaca has been overrun by insolent, armed young men, who have been eating and drinking Telemachus out of his patrimony, and who promise to continue doing so until his mother Penelope agrees to marry one of them. Mulligan is likened to the chief of these suitors, Antinous, at several points in the narrative, and his mixture of gaiety and malice recapitulates the spirit found in the feasting hall of Odysseus' palace. At the breakfast which he cooks for his two companions, \"He lunged toward his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled on his knife\"; later he mildly rebukes Stephen for eating too much of the food. At the end of the Odyssey, the feasting hall becomes an abattoir, as Odysseus and Telemachus separate the suitors from their weapons and slaughter them to the last man."

    "note": " Over the course of several pages in Telemachus the reader receives various details about the living area inside the Martello tower at Sandycove. The tower is currently maintained as a museum which attempts to recreate the living conditions that Joyce experienced in 1904. Photographs of the interior can give some sense of the setting evoked in the novel.",
    "expandedNote": " \"In the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan's gowned form moved briskly about the hearth to and fro, hiding and revealing its yellow glow. Two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor from the high barbacans.\" A stove presently vents into the fireplace, but the narrative makes clear that Mulligan is cooking over the open fire of the “hearth,” since the yellow glow of the coals is visible and \"a cloud of coalsmoke\" fills the room, choking its inhabitants. \n Two shafts of soft daylight are indeed visible in the photograph at right, slanting into the room from angled wells that reach up to openings in the thick stone walls that the narrative refers to as “high barbacans.\" In Circe theBlack Mass that Mulligan has mockingly evoked on the top of the tower is reenacted in this room below, on the second floor, and the hearthstone becomes an altarstone: \"From the high barbacans of the tower two shafts of light fall on the smokepalled altarstone.\"\n Barbicans (from French barbacane and Provençal barbacana, hence perhaps Joyce's spelling) can be towers or other defensive outer works of a castle, often near a gate or drawbridge. But as Marc Therre observes in a personal communication, the OED lists the obsolete meaning of \"A loophole in the wall of a castle.\" Therre notes that \"barbacan,\" spelled this way and carrying this sense, is used both in William Beckford's Gothic novel Vathek (1816) and in Carlo Botta's History of the War of the Independence of the United States of America (1826, translated from the 1809 Italian original).\n In a corner of the room opposite to the fireplace, a hammock has been slung to recreate Trench’s sleeping conditions, mentioned twice in Telemachus: \"A tall figure rose from the hammock where it had been sitting\"; “he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of the hammock.” (The word holdfast apparently refers to a bolt anchored in the stone wall.) Joyce's bed was probably to the left, between Trench's hammock and the fireplace. \n In Trench’s nightmare, a black panther was crouching on the hearth, waiting to spring, and the Englishman fired his revolver in the direction of the fireplace, quite close to Joyce's bed. The curators of the museum have installed a kitschy statue to play the part of the beast.\n The \"heavy door\" which Mulligan cries out to have opened, itself accessed by two \"inner doors,\" is different from the opening that leads via steep stone stairs up to the roof. It leads down from the second-story livingroom to the ground via a \"ladder.\" In 1904, this door afforded the only entrance to the tower, and the large key mentioned repeatedly in the narrative allowed the iron door at the top to be locked. Today, an opening has been cut into the tower on the ground floor as an entrance to the museum.\n When breakfast is finished, the three men exit the tower through this exterior door on their way to the swimming hole."

He thinks of the book in Calypso after imagining a long day's stroll through the streets of a Middle Eastern city, with a skeptical attitude toward both the daydream and the book: \"Probably not a bit like it really. Kind of stuff you read.\" Despite these harsh words, the book is informative, observant, and fairly judicious. It appears to have given Bloom some of his ideas about far-flung, exotic parts of the world.",
    "expandedNote": " Frederick Diodati Thompson published In the Track of the Sun: Readings from the Diary of a Globe Trotter in 1893. The book was bound in \"yellow cloth,\" as Ithaca notes, but it does not have a \"Sunburst on the titlepage,\" as Bloom thinks in Calypso.His odd statement may owe to other facts noted in Ithaca: \"titlepage missing, recurrent title intestation.\" Whatever \"intestation\" may mean in this context (it usually refers to being deprived of the right to make a will, as in \"dying intestate\"), it seems that Bloom's copy lacks a title page. (Perhaps someone has drawn in a sketch of the rising sun?) Thompson's title page displays photographs of a Great Buddha statue from southeast Asia and a musician from Japan. Hundreds of other photographs and drawings adorn the pages of the text. \n Thompson traveled overland from New York to Victoria, BC, and then to Japan, China, Ceylon, India, Egypt, and Palestine. The last of these locales described in the book seems to have especially captured Bloom's imagination. His picture of \"Orangegroves and immense melonfields north of Jaffa\" a bit later in Calypso, while he reads a proposal \"To purchase waste sandy tracts from Turkish government and plant with eucalyptus trees,\" probably owes something to Thompson: \"Leaving Jaffa, we passed through many orange groves. . . . The land may be to some extent worn out, but by proper cultivation and the use of fertilizers it could be made very productive\" (190). A picture of Jerusalem's Damascus Gate in Thompson's book (191), and thoughts about the gates of Damascus itself (211), may have inspired Bloom's thoughts, in the daydream, of a \"city gate\" with a \"sentry there.\" Thompson visited several mosques in the area, and Bloom thinks of \"The shadows of the mosques among the pillars.\" \n Thompson also made a trip to the Dead Sea, noting that \"The scenery is desolate and weird. On either side the mountains rise abruptly, barren and harsh, without trees or grass. . . . Numerous events of biblical record happened on these Dead Sea shores. It was here that Lot's wife, for looking back in disobedience to the command of the Lord, was turned into a pillar of salt\" (197). Bloom thinks, \"Vulcanic lake, the dead sea: no fish, weedless, sunk deep in the earth. No wind would lift those waves, grey metal, poisonous foggy waters. Brimstone they called it raining down: the cities of the plain: Sodom, Gomorrah, Edom.\" Attempting to swim in the mineral-laden water, Thompson found that \"my feet went into the air, the water being so buoyant, and it was difficult to make any headway\" (198). Bloom thinks of a similar scene in Lotus Eaters: \"Where was the chap I saw in that picture somewhere? Ah yes, in the dead sea floating on his back, reading a book with a parasol open. Couldn't sink if you tried: so thick with salt.\"\n However much Thompson's book may or may not have contributed to Bloom's picture of the Middle East, its title has certainly engaged his imagination. His daydream begins with a fantasy of keeping one step ahead of the sun: \"Somewhere in the east: early morning: set off at dawn. Travel round in front of the sun, steal a day's march on him. Keep it up for ever never grow a day older technically.\" Stephen has entertained a similar fancy in Proteus, imagining the gypsy couple walking \"Across the sands of all the world, \"followed by the sun's flaming sword, to the west.\""

Beginning in 1896 the company began the electrification of its trams, which had previously been horse-drawn.

It is mentioned again in Eumaeus when \"a Dublin United Tramways Company’s sandstrewer\" passes by Bloom and Stephen, prompting Bloom to mention his close encounter with one of these machines at the beginning of Circe.

The verbs all mean roughly the same thing, and they appear to refer to the gypsy woman he is watching on the tide flats.",
    "expandedNote": " \"Trudge\" and \"drag\" are English, differing chiefly in that one is intransitive (walking heavily along, as in exhaustion) and the other transitive (pulling something heavy behind one). \"Schlepp\" is German for dragging something or for trudging. \"Train\" comes from French traîner, to drag something or to lag behind. \"Trascine\" is from Italian trascinare, to drag or (formed reflexively, trascinarsi) to drag oneself along, lag behind. \n Gifford suggests that \"The reference is to Eve, whose load of 'sorrow' was 'greatly multiplied by the Fall (Genesis 3:16).\" But Genesis never calls Eve's suffering a load or burden, and for \"She\" to refer to Eve, one would have to assume some female personage in the previous sentence, which evokes the exile from Eden but never mentions either Eve or Adam. \n The much more reasonable assumption is that \"She\" is the gypsy woman that Stephen has been contemplating for a good long while. She has \"Spoils slung at her back,\" and both she and her partner have already been textually engaged in the first of these verb-actions: \"Shouldering their bags they trudged, the red Egyptians.\" Just before Stephen searches for international synonyms for \"trudge\" (perhaps inspired by these international travelers), he has noticed one of them looking his way: \"Passing now. / A side eye at my Hamlet hat.\""

  "070005trivial": {
    "note": " As J. J. O'Molloy lights a cigarette in Aeolus, a bizarre utterance also flares up and leaves as suddenly as it came: \"I have often thought since on looking back over that strange time that it was that small act, trivial in itself, that striking of that match, that determined the whole aftercourse of both our lives.\" The sentence is supremely enigmatic, and readers may be tempted to write it off as merely absurd, or as some kind of obscure send-up. Parody is certainly involved—some of Charles Dickens' prose is echoed verbatim—but on close inspection the sentence speaks volumes about what Joyce once called \"the significance of trivial things,\" and about his daring experiments with narration.",
    "expandedNote": "For an inquisitive reader, the sentence raises many basic questions. Who is the \"I\"? What relationship is referenced in \"both our lives\"? How could a flaring match possibly determine their \"whole aftercourse\"? From what temporal perspective does the \"I\" find itself \"looking back\" at the present action? Why does the reflection take the form of such a teasingly periodic sentence? Does any of this—the first-person narrator, the human relationship, the retrospective view, the extravagant claim, the ornate style—possess enough substance to amount to representation of something, or is it mere linguistic fluff, a gesture toward narrative signification that gets blown away in the breezes of this windy chapter? \n Wholly satisfying answers to these questions may prove elusive, but Joyce supplies enough tantalizing details to tempt readers to dig in. In Ulysses the presence of an \"I\" outside of quoted speech immediately suggests the possibility of interior monologue. This sentence, however, does not quite fit the pattern: although its \"I\" does think private thoughts, it also seems to seize control of the narration, telling the story of what happened in the newspaper office from the vantage of a distant future. Cyclopswill introduce first-person narration for the span of an entire chapter. Here, it lasts for one sentence and narrates nothing more than its own thoughts.\n The brief quasi-narration occurs in close proximity to sentences of pure interior monologue whose source is unmistakable. When O'Molloy first signals to Stephen Dedalus (\"J. J. O'Molloy turned to Stephen and said quietly and slowly\") his intention to recite the words that Seymour Bushe uttered in trying a case of alleged fratricide, Stephen lapses into his own thoughts about fratricide: \"And in the porches of mine ear did pour. / By the way how did he find that out? He died in his sleep. Or the other story, beast with two backs?\" Lenehan obsequiously announces the delivery of \"A few wellchosen words\" and demands \"Silence!,\" whereupon O'Molloy takes out his cigarette case and gathers his thoughts, prompting some irreverent person to think, \"False lull. Something quite ordinary.\" Again this must be Stephen, because when the speech is over O'Molloy asks him if he has enjoyed it and \"Stephen, his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture, blushed.\" The skepticism that he expressed in interior monologue has been overcome.\n Third-person narration returns after the thought \"Something quite ordinary,\" but now with an odd word choice that suggests free indirect style not far removed from the realm of interior monologue: \"Messenger took out his matchbox thoughtfully and lit his cigar.\" The messenger here must be Lenehan, who has deliverered Sport racing sheets to the Evening Telegraph office. Earlier in the chapter, when O'Molloy was handing out cigarettes, Lenehan has responded to his question, \"Who has the most matches?\": \"He offered a cigarette to the professor and took one himself. Lenehan promptly struck a match for them and lit their cigarettes in turn. J. J. O'Molloy opened his case again and offered it.\" Once again, Lenehan gives O'Molloy a light, holding out a flaring match.\n There follows the numinous insight into the occult powers of matches, expressed in the efflorescent style of the strange \"I.\" Gifford observes that \"This stylistic intrusion echoes the Dickens of David Copperfield (1849-50) and Great Expectations (1861); as, for example, David on the wedding of Peggoty and Barkis: 'I have often thought, since, what an odd, innocent, out-of-the-way kind of wedding it must have been! We got into the chaise again soon after dark, and drove cosily back, looking up at the stars and talking about them' (chap. 10).\" In chapter 8 of Great Expectations, Pip remarks of Miss Havisham, \"I have often thought since, that she must have looked as if the admission of the natural light of day would have struck her to dust.\" Similar expressions occur several more times in that novel. \n Joyce's verbatim repetition of \"I have often thought since\" is indeed remarkable, but there is more of Dickens in his sentence than simply a stylistic flourish. Between the first-person narratives of David Copperfield and Great Expectations, Dickens wrote Bleak House (1853), a novel that (uniquely in Dickens' corpus) alternates first- and third-person narratives. Joyce possessed a copy of Bleak House in his Trieste library, along with David Copperfield. In chapter 31, when co-narrator Esther Summerson goes with Charley to visit the brickmaker's family, she employs a close analogue of the relevant phrase to reflect on changes in the course of her life: \"I had not thought, that night—none, I am quite sure—of what was soon to happen to me. But I have always remembered since, that when we had stopped at the garden gate to look up at the sky, and when we went upon our way, I had for a moment an undefinable impression of myself as being something different from what I then was. I know it was then, and there, that I had it. I have ever since connected the feeling with that spot and time, and with everything associated with that spot and time, to the distant voices in the town, the barking of a dog, and the sound of wheels coming down the miry hill.\" \n The parallels between this scene and Joyce's sentence are extraordinarily compelling. Looking back from a future in which she has become something very different from what she once was, Esther fixates on a seemingly ordinary moment in her past life that nevertheless seemed to her, and still seems, pregnant with the possibility of change. A garden gate, the cold night sky, the sounds of a dog barking, people talking, wheels slopping down a muddy road: none of these details holds in itself any particular prophetic promise, but for her they expressed what her life was about to become. If the writer were not Dickens but Joyce, they could be called an epiphany—one of those ordinary but eloquent moments that the young Joyce wrote down as seeds of future stories. His epiphanies were symbolic, and he gave them a religious name to describe their mysterious power, but instead of pointing toward transcendental realities he saw them as opening windows into the moral lives of human beings. \n The person who gazes at the flaring match in Aeolus makes just this kind of connection between a mundane event and the mysteries of human change. The action is certainly \"trivial in itself,\" but Joyce loved to defend his representation of trivialities. Ellman's biography notes that when he was writing Stephen Hero in 1904 he said to his brother Stanislaus, \"Do you see that man who has just skipped out of the way of the tram? Consider, if he had been run over, how significant every act of his would at once become. I don't mean for the police inspector. I mean for anybody who knew him. And his thoughts, for anybody that could know them. It is my idea of the significance of trivial things that I want to give the two or three unfortunate wretches who may eventually read me\" (163). Small moments and small actions seem significant when they have a clear connection to the course of a human life—say, by suddenly ending it. But when the connections are less obvious, it falls to the artist to show how intimately our lives are bound up with the things of our experience.\n The sentence in Aeolus asserts a connection much stronger than the one Esther asserts in Bleak House. When she writes, \"I have ever since connected the feeling to that spot and time,\" a reader might understand her to be saying simply that her changed state was associated with the scene on the road. Joyce's \"I\" instead says definitively that the lighting of a match \"determined\" the course of his life. Postmodern readers might hear in this claim of distant causality an anticipation of the \"butterfly effect,\" that commonplace of late 20th and early 21st century culture which holds that a butterly flapping its wings in Delhi can affect lives several weeks later in Omaha, say by changing the path of a tornado. \n This meme of our times derives from the 1960s-era chaos theory of the American meteorologist and mathematician Edward Lorenz, who noticed that tiny input changes in a mathematical weather model could, over time, produce large changes in output. A colleague expressed the finding by saying that a seagull flapping its wings could permanently alter the weather, and Lorenz, embracing this image, changed the gull to a butterfly. By coincidence, however, when one plots the \"Lorenz attractor\"—a set of solutions to the system of three differential equations that Lorenz devised to predict the chaotic effect of non-linear deterministic systems—the resulting graph resembles the wings of a butterfly. \n The randomizing determinism that is chaos theory found its breakthrough formulations in the 20th century, but its roots go back at least to German philosopher Johann Gottlieb Fichte's The Vocation of Man (1800): \"you could not remove a single grain of sand from its place, without thereby, although perhaps imperceptibly to you, altering something throughout all parts of the immeasurable whole. . . . Suppose it to lie some few paces further inland than it does:—then must the storm-wind that drove it in from the sea have been stronger than it actually was;—then must the preceding state of the weather, by which this wind was occasioned, and its degree of strength determined, have been different from what it actually was . . . and thus you have, without stay or limit, a wholly different temperature of the air from that which really existed, and a different constitution of the bodies which possess an influence over this temperature. . . . how can you know, that in such a state of weather as may have been necessary to carry this grain of sand a few paces further inland, some one of your forefathers might not have perished from hunger, or cold, or heat, before begetting that son from whom you are descended; and thus that you might never have been at all, and all that you have ever done, and all that you might ever hope to do in this world, must have been obstructed, in order that a grain of sand might lie in a different place?\" (trans. William Smith, 1848). \n There may be legitimate philosophical and scientific reasons, then, for supposing that something as trivial as the striking of a match could affect \"the whole aftercourse\" of a human life. But does the novel encourage readers of this passage to take its extravagant claim so seriously? Joyce's imitation of Dickens' language is close enough to be called a parody, and it resembles the long parodic imitations that irrupt in later chapters like Cyclops, Nausicaa, and Oxen of the Sun. If Stephen is the subject responsible for these thoughts, he could be mocking the spiritual pretentiousness of his \"epiphanies\" with some overblown Victorian language, as he has already done more crudely in Proteus. But Joyce's stylistic parodies typically combine mockery with sympathetic engagement, and in this instance the text encourages a sympathetic reading, because Stephen is focusing on an image that is often associated quite unmockingly with his spiritual aspirations: the lighting of a fire. \n Stephen has a well-documented history of looking at sudden blazes and seeing the hidden life of the soul. In part 5 of A Portrait of the Artist he watches the dean of studies lighting a coal fire in a grate and thinks that \"his very soul had waxed old in that service without growing towards light and beauty or spreading abroad a sweet odour of her sanctity.\" Later, he speaks to Lynch of the moment in the artist's life \"when the esthetic image is first conceived in his imagination. The mind in that mysterious instant Shelley likened beautifully to a fading coal.\" He experiences such a moment just before composing his villanelle: \"The instant flashed forth like a point of light . . . An afterglow deepened within his spirit, whence the white flame had passed, deepening to a rose and ardent light.\" \n The scene with O'Molloy is one of three such moments that Ulysses adds to the three from Stephen's past life. In Ithaca he is again present when someone kneels before paper, sticks, and coal assembled in a hearth. The prose conveys his Trinitarian, and demonic, habits of thought as Bloom lights a fire \"at three projecting points of paper with one ignited lucifer match.\" In a similar echo of the earlier novel, Scylla and Charybdis returns to Shelley's image of a fading coal, joining it now very explicitly to Stephen's thoughts about the potential for personal change: \"In the intense instant of imagination, when the mind, Shelley says, is a fading coal, that which I was is that which I am and that which in possibility I may come to be. So in the future, the sister of the past, I may see myself as I sit here now but by reflection from that which then I shall be.\"\n Any mockery implied by the parodic language would seem, then, to be overbalanced by the weight of five other passages in which fires are associated with Stephen's ongoing imperative to liberate his entrapped soul and become a Dedalean artist. But if one reads the passage in this way, what can be made of his projecting himself into an undefined future from whose vantage he and some unnamed person look back on the changed courses of their two lives? By the time she writes \"I have always remembered since,\" Esther Summerson has married Mr. Woodcourt and enjoyed some measure of wedded bliss. Is Stephen imagining a time in which he and some as-yet-unfound spouse similarly look back on the events that brought them together? Is he thinking of his life and O'Molloy's? His and someone else's? Is the mysterious \"I\" even limited to the consciousness of Stephen?\n At this point the questions that can be asked of the sentence probably begin to outstrip plausible answers. But at least one more interesting observation can be made about it. In a novel built on coincidences, there is one other moment in which someone stares at a tiny, insignificant, red object and sees his life writ small in its contours. In Oxen of the Sun Bloom becomes lost in thought gazing at a bottle of number one Bass ale. The rapture extends across three of the parodic styles of that chapter, all of which detect a numinous quality in his contemplation. \"What is the age of the soul of man?\" asks a passage inspired by Charles Lamb before it describes Bloom thinking about his past. A paragraph inspired by Thomas de Quincey speaks of voices blending in a \"silence that is the infinite of space: and swiftly, silently the soul is wafted over regions of cycles of generations that have lived.\" In a style evocative of Walter Savage Landor, Buck Mulligan says of Bloom, \"His soul is far away. It is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be born. Any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the incorruptible eon of the gods.\" \n But Bloom is not contemplating transcendental realities. The section of Oxen that comes next dismisses \"the preposterous surmise about him being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which was entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character.\" Bloom, it says, has merely been \"recollecting two or three private transactions of his own,\" and indeed the Lamb section has shown him recalling two or three scenes from his teenage life twenty years earlier. This would seem to be one of many moments in which Ulysses shows the minds of its protagonists following similar trajectories. Captivated by a red triangle, Bloom is transported far back into his young adult years. Captivated by the flare of a match, Stephen is transported far beyond his young adult years into a maturity in which he can see the shape that his life will have taken. As he says in Scylla and Charybdis, \"in the future, the sister of the past, I may see myself as I sit here now but by reflection from that which then I shall be.\" \n Is it possible, then, that \"our lives\" refers to Stephen and Bloom? If Stephen matures to become an artist who can write a book like Ulysses, then Joyce's autobiographical persona will have reached a point where, like Esther Summerson, he can join his creator as co-author of the story of his life. At that point his \"I\" will be virtually indistinguishable from the \"I\" of his maker, much as the person of the Son is consubstantial with the Father. And from that perspective he will be able to appreciate the confluence of forces that brought his life into alignment with the life of a middle-class ad canvasser. \n This reading of the sentence would at least slightly ameliorate the absurdity of having a fictive character jump forward in time—because, in a sense, it is actually Joyce projecting himself into the action of his heavily autobiographical fiction. It would also assure the reader that despite the immense differences in their natures, and the younger man's evident hesitation to accept the friendly overtures of the older one, Stephen and Bloom are fated to discover connections as integral as those joining the butterfly's wings in a Lorenz attractor. Bloom's \"small act\" of helping a dazed young genius off the pavement and escorting him home may qualify as another event determining the aftercourse of two lives."

  "050010mosquebaths": {
    "note": " In Calypso Bloom thinks of taking a bath in \"Tara street.\" In the next chapter, standing in the chemist's shop near the corner of Westland Row and Lincoln Place, he thinks that he has \"Time to get a bath round the corner. Hammam. Turkish. Massage.\" After leaving the shop and dodging Bantam Lyons as quickly as possible, \"He walked cheerfully toward the mosque of the baths,\" thinking that they \"Remind you of a mosque, redbaked bricks, the minarets.\" These are two different public bath establishments, and in Ithaca we learn that between Lotus Eaters and Hades Bloom has in fact visited a third one.",
    "expandedNote": " The Tara Street establishment was the Dublin Corporation Public Baths, Wash Houses, and Public Swimming Baths. Gifford notes that its superintendent was one J. P. O'Brien. Bloom thinks that a \"Chap in the paybox\" at the Tara Street baths \"got away James Stephens,\" so the \"O'Brien\" who passes through his mind just after this is quite likely J. P., rather than William Smith or James Francis Xavier. \n A for-profit bathhouse in the style of a \"mosque\" stood for some years on the west side of Lincoln Place, not far from Bloom's location on Westland Row, but the business had closed in 1900. Ithaca mentions that Bloom actually visits another Turkish-style bathhouse on Leinster Street, just past the Lincoln Place one. The Leinster building did not have an oriental-looking exterior. Working from memory, Joyce appears to have conflated the two establishments.\n \"Hammam\" is the Turkish and Arabic name for public baths, often laid out in a series of rooms providing different degrees of moisture and heat. The ones that were constructed in Victorian Ireland were not derived directly from Turkish practice. Nor did the Turks hold any monopoly on the tradition: similar baths had been built throughout the Islamic Near East and North Africa, not to mention the eastern part of the Roman empire. \n On his scholarly website, victorianturkishbath.org, Malcolm Shifrin provides the following definition of the Victorian version: \"a type of bath in which the bather sweats freely in a room heated by hot dry air (or in a series of two or three such rooms maintained at progressively higher temperatures), usually followed by a cold plunge, a full body wash and massage, and a final period of relaxation in a cooling-room.\" The dry heat of these establishments distinguished them from actual Turkish baths, which are typically steamy. Many of them also offered ordinary baths in private rooms fitted with tubs, as reflected in the name of the house that Bloom visits: the Leinster Turkish and Warm Baths.\n Bloom does not have time to get a full \"Turkish\" bath before the funeral, but he thinks of the massage he could get if he did: \"Nicer if a nice girl did it. Also I think I. Yes I. Do it in the bath. Curious longing I. Water to water. Combine business with pleasure. Pity no time for massage. Feel fresh then all the day. Funeral be rather glum.\" His impulse to masturbate in the water implies a private bath, and this interpretation coheres with the enameled tub that he imagines several paragraphs later in Lotus Eaters: \"Enjoy a bath now: clean trough of water, cool enamel, the gentle tepid stream. This is my body. / He foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full, naked, in a womb of warmth, oiled by scented melting soap, softly laved.\"\n Much later in the day, in Nausicaa, we learn that Bloom has in fact visited the baths before going to the cemetery, but has not indulged his impulse to masturbate in the water: \"Damned glad I didn't do it in the bath this morning over her silly I will punish you letter.\"Ithaca provides the exact address (attached to the wrong façade): \"the oriental edifice of the Turkish and Warm Baths, 11 Leinster street.\"\n Nine separate Turkish bath establishments were built in Dublin in the second half of the 19th century, following a trend initiated in Cork in 1858. In 1904 several of these businesses remained, hotly competing for customers. In addition to the Leinster Street baths, there was one on Upper Sackville Street and one near Stephen's Green. The furnishings in these establishments were sumptuous and exotic: attendants wore exotic near-eastern costumes; customers could fortify themselves with Turkish coffee and smoke tobacco from long-stemmed Turkish pipes while reclining on ottomans; crescent shapes abounded; colored glass doors, windows, skylights, and lamps created rich visual impressions both during daylight hours and in the evening. A customer of the Upper Sackville Street hammam quoted on Shifrin's site wrote, \"When the whole building is lighted up it has more the appearance of a scene in one of Scheherazade's beautiful tales than of a solid, bona fide brick and mortar business in the centre of a great city.\" \n Shifrin emphasizes the exotic appeal of these establishments: \"Today, television brings the sights and sounds of foreign countries right into our living rooms, people travel easily to the Middle East and beyond, and there is hardly a major city in the British Isles which is without at least one purpose-built mosque. We have become familiar with the appearance of Islamic, or as it was often called, Saracenic architecture in our midst. It is, therefore, difficult to imagine how ordinary people must have reacted on their first sight of this exotic addition to the often distinguished, but very Western, buildings of Dublin. / A visitor from England signing himself 'A moist man' wrote on his return, 'The morning was raw and wet and cheerless when I left my hotel, and, after a sloppy walk, found myself before a building of oriental architecture, crowned with fantastic minarets, as rich with Saracenic ornament as plaster of Paris and stucco could make them.'\" \n Bloom's reflection on this exotic locale aligns with many such moments in Joyce's writings: the boy's longing to visit the bazaar in Araby; Bloom's fantasy of walking through an Arabic souk in Calypso; Stephen's fancies of Moorish mathematics in Nestor; Stephen's dream of the Baghdadi ruler Harun al-Rashid in Proteus, followed by Bloom's appearance as that figure in Circe; Stephen's interest in \"The pillared Moorish hall\" in Scylla and Charybdis; Bloom's thoughts of Mohammed and his cat earlier in Lotus Eaters; the many references to the Mohammedan religion in Finnegans Wake; and so forth."

A hand plucked the harpstrings, merging their twining chords. Wavewhite wedded words shimmering on the dim tide.\" Joyce’s prose lushly imitates the sounds coupling within his protagonist’s mind.",
    "expandedNote": " The \"twining stresses, two by two\" that Stephen recalls from Yeats' paired spondees (white breast, dim sea) open out to generate more couplings linked by sense (inshore/farther out), alliteration (water/whitened/wavewhite wedded words, hand/harpstrings), assonance (whitened/lightshod/white breast/twining/wavewhite/tide, spurned/hurrying/merging), and rhyme (chords/words, shimmering/dim). \n The mysterious ways in which words combine to make patterns of beautiful sound occupy Stephen’s thoughts throughout A Portrait and Ulysses. Proteus will show him writing down snatches of a poem generated almost entirely by sounds—as the villanelle in Portrait did more impressively. In Aeolus he thinks about Dante’s gorgeous rhymes as beautiful girls in harmonious colors; “But I old men, penitent, leadenfooted, underdarkneath the night: mouth south: tomb womb.” At the end of Aeolus he takes a different tack, trying out a fragmentary story."

    "note": " When Bloom changes his mind about having lunch in Burton's restaurant, he performs a little charade: \"Mr Bloom raised two fingers doubtfully to his lips. His eyes said: / — Not here. Don't see him. / Out. I hate dirty eaters. / He backed towards the door.\" The gesture of putting two fingers to one's lips seems perhaps universally to indicate the condition of being absorbed in thought. Bloom uses it to sell a small social fiction covering his actual reasons for leaving the restaurant.",
    "expandedNote": " Rather than allowing revulsion to appear in his face, Bloom adopts the posture of someone scanning the room for an acquaintance, not finding him, and determining to seek him elsewhere. Joyce creates this dumbshow not only by having Bloom place two fingers on his lips but also via the remarkable narrative strategy of giving his eyes a speaking part. Together, the two gestures create a white lie whose purpose may be to spare the feelings of others. Bloom is a courteous man, so one might suppose that he wishes to let the people in the restaurant know that something other than disgust motivates his departure. \n But in the crowded, noisy, and sloppy environs of the Burton it is hard to imagine either the harassed waiters or the monstrously scarfing diners caring very much about the sudden departure of a newly arrived customer. They are what Peter Kuch, writing about another of Bloom's charades, calls \"a wholly imagined audience.\" Bloom seems to be in the habit of masking his thoughts even in social situations where he is not particularly vulnerable or offensive—suggesting that this is an unusually self-conscious person, keenly attuned to the potential hostility of other human beings and very susceptible to shame. This interpretation is consistent with the hallucinations of Circe, in which Bloom is regularly accused of doing shameful things and regularly justifies or lies about his intentions."

    "note": " Looking out across the sand flats toward the incoming tide inProteus, Stephen sees first a dog and then two human beings to whom the dog belongs. He will soon see the indistinct humans as \"A woman and a man,\" then as \"Cocklepickers,\" then as \"red Egyptians.\" But before he can see clearly enough to resolve even their gender, he imagines them as female figures from the Bible: \"The two maries. They have tucked it safe mong the bulrushes.\" He is joining two very different biblical passages, and thereby joining ideas of womanhood, birth, and death.",
    "expandedNote": " The \"two maries\" are \"Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses\" (Matthew 27:56). (Joses is a shortened Greek form of Joseph, encountered often in the New Testament.) The two women sit outside the rock cave in which Jesus' body has been placed, and on the following morning they come back to the sepulcher, Mark's gospel noting that they have \"brought sweet spices\" to the tomb \"that they might come and anoint him.\" But the large stone sealing the tomb has been rolled away, Jesus' body is gone, and an angel sitting at the tomb tells them that he has risen from the dead. As the women go to deliver this news to the disciples, Jesus appears (to both women in Matthew, and only to Mary Magdalene in Mark) telling them not to fear and to inform the disciples that they will see him alive. \n The reference to \"bulrushes\" alludes to the story of Moses' infancy at the beginning of Exodus. The Jews descended from Joseph and his brothers have multiplied to an alarming extent, and a Pharaoh \"which knew not Joseph\" gives orders that all male Jewish babies shall be killed. In order to evade this command, Moses' mother hides her son, \"And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink\" (2:3). The child is later discovered and adopted by the Pharaoh's daughter.\n Why should Stephen recall these two stories as he struggles to make out who is walking toward him on the strand? There would seem to be a connection with the two women who earlier descended \"the steps from Leahy's terrace,\" since he imagined one of them as a midwife carrying \"A misbirth with a trailing navelcord.\" These two new figures, like the midwives, have to do with both birth and death. \n The cultural role of women as caretakers both at the start of life and at its end makes other appearances in the novel. At the beginning of Hades, Bloom sees an old woman peering through her window at the funeral carriages and thinks of the tradition of women preparing the bodies of corpses. He makes a connection to childbirth: \"Extraordinary the interest they take in a corpse. Glad to see us go we give them such trouble coming.\" In Oxen of the Sun, the two old women on the beach return in one of Stephen's monologues: \"The aged sisters draw us into life: we wail, batten, sport, clip, clasp, sunder, dwindle, die: over us dead they bend. First, saved from water of old Nile, among bulrushes, a bed of fasciated wattles: at last the cavity of a mountain.\""

    "note": " Stephen calls himself \"the servant of two masters,\" indicting \"The imperial British state\" in England and \"the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church\" in Italy. He is determined to free his thoughts from the mind-control of both institutions.",
    "expandedNote": " Stephen has defined himself in A Portrait of the Artist as “free of all existing orders,” and he objects entirely as much to religious orders as to political ones. After his decision not to become a priest, which is simultaneously a decision to leave the church, he tells his friend Lynch, “I will not serve,” echoing the utterance by which Lucifer rebelled against God: Non serviam. In Circe he renews his defiance, asserting a Romantic conviction that art can effect a liberation of the individual mind: \"The intellectual imagination! With me all or not at all. Non serviam!\" Shortly later, tapping his forehead, he thinks, “in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.” The individual who accepts submission to the church and the state can never be his \"own master.\" \n Haines understands why an Irishman might resent the British, but Stephen's riddling identification of the Catholic Church as \"an Italian\" master puzzles him. Anti-colonialism was linked with anti-clericalism in Joyce’s mind for reasons more specific than just the abstract similarity of two repressive regimes. When Stephen rhetorically balances the “imperial British“ state against the “holy Roman” church, he is calling attention to a devil’s bargain between English imperial power and Roman ecclesiastical power in the second half of the 12th century. \n When the western part of the Roman Empire disintegrated in the 5th century, the western part of the Church played a crucial role in establishing new forms of social order, laying some of the foundations for what eventually became modern European nation-states. Ireland, however, had never been a part of the Roman Empire, and its church pursued an independent path, far less concerned with social order and political hierarchy. The focus of the Irish church was monasticism. Its abbots wielded far more power and influence than its bishops, and its monks preserved and advanced learning at a time when, on the continent, libraries were in ruins, manuscripts were not being copied, and intellectual inquiry was largely stagnant. In the 6th and 7th centuries Irish monks began to export their learning and spirituality to the impoverished continent. In Proteus, Stephen thinks about a key early figure of this history, “the fiery Columbanus.” \n “Catholic” means “universal,” and Roman means imperial. As the centuries wore on, Roman clerics expressed increasing impatience with their Celtic brothers’ independence in matters of ecclesiastical hierarchy and liturgical rites. In the 12th century, their impulse to enforce conformity found common cause with the Norman barons’ impulse to conquer ever more territories. In 1169 an English cardinal named Nicholas Breakspear became pontiff; his career had been advanced by the English king Henry II. As Pope Adrian IV, one of Breakspear’s first actions was to reward his patron by issuing the infamous bull that begins with the word Laudabiliter, condemning the renegade Irish church and awarding temporal sway over all Ireland to England. This invitation to conquest triggered the Anglo-Norman invasions of Henry II’s reign, initiating a long history of English colonialism in Ireland. And the Norman overlords, remembering their debt to the pope, reformed the Irish church into a distinctly RomanCatholic Church forevermore marked by subservience rather than independence. Many Irish prelates became submissive not only to Rome but also to Westminster. \n In the 1860s the Catholic bishops consistently opposed the fenian movement, and their rejection of Charles Stewart Parnell, after the scandal of his adultery broke, turned the tide of public opinion against that parliamentary evangelist for Home Rule. Instructed by his patriotic and anti-clerical father, Joyce was well versed in the craven political conservatism of the clergy. In 1906 he wrote to his brother Stanislaus, \"I quite see, of course, that the Church is still, as it was in the time of Adrian IV, the enemy of Ireland; but, I think, her time is almost up\" (Ellmann, 237)."

  "010129ubermensch": {
    "note": " At the end of Telemachus Mulligan playfully compares himself to the unfallen man of Christian myth, and then to the fully evolved man of Nietzschean philosophy: \"My twelfth rib is gone, he cried. I'm the Uebermensch.\" The sudden disappearance of a rib makes him Adam, and in the figure of the Übermensch he aspires to Friedrich Nietzsche's prophetic ideal of a man who succeeds in overcoming the soul-killing heritage of Christian ethics and metaphysics. Several sentences later, Mulligan perverts the language of Proverbs 19:17 (“He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the Lord”) to trumpet Nietzsche's rejection of Christian ethics: \"He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord. Thus spake Zarathustra.\"",
    "expandedNote": " Nietzsche developed his concept of the superman or overman in two works of the 1880s, The Gay Science and Thus Spake Zarathustra. Mr. James Duffy, the protagonist of “A Painful Case,” one of the short stories of Dubliners, owns copies of both works. In a 1904 card addressed to publisher George Roberts, a young Joyce, who likewise had been reading some of Nietzsche's works, signed his name \"James Overman.\" \n Ellmann speculates that \"it was probably upon Nietzsche that Joyce drew when he expounded to his friends a neo-paganism that glorified selfishness, licentiousness, and pitilessness, and denounced gratitude and other 'domestic virtues'\" (142). In Ulysses it is not only Mulligan who displays this kind of reaction to the Übermensch. Stephen too, in Oxen of the Sun, parodies biblical language in a Nietzschean spirit to justify sexual licentiousness: \"Greater love than this, he said, no man hath that a man lay down his wife for his friend. Go thou and do likewise. Thus, or words to that effect, saith Zarathustra, sometime regius professor of French letters to the university of Oxtail nor breathed there ever that man to whom mankind was more beholden.\" \"French letters\" are condoms. \n In the same chapter, Stephen also recalls Mulligan's parody of Proverbs, this time to attack the financial greed of the Catholic church. In response to Bloom's tongue-in-cheek ruling that, when forced to choose between saving the life of a pregnant woman or her child, the child should live because then the church will receive both \"birth and death pence,\" Stephen \"was a marvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken.\" \n Ellmann observes that \"At heart Joyce can scarcely have been a Nietzschean\" (142). Joyce did indeed prove not to be one in the limited and distorted sense of justifying selfish impulses and slaying sacred cows, but there is more to Nietzsche and to Joyce's engagement with his ideas. Ulysses seems very Nietzschean in its rejection of transcendental metaphysics that devalue life and shackle human beings in sin and guilt. Criticism is beginning to come to terms with the ways in which the novel follows Nietzsche in seeking an answer to nihilism by affirming embodied existence and overcoming mere \"humanity.\" In addition to Sam Slote's Joyce's Nietzschean Ethics (Palgrave, 2013), there is an excellent unpublished undergraduate thesis by Nathan Miller, \"Reading Nietzsche in James Joyce's Ulysses\" (2011)."

    "note": " During the political battles over Home Rule that stretched from the 1870s to the early 90s, the phrase \"For Ulster will fight, and Ulster will be right\" became a rallying cry for the Protestant Unionists in the North who wished to defeat the movement. Stephen scathingly (though silently) recalls this recent verbal bauble of the loyalists, just as he earlier thought of older cultural memes: \"Glorious, pious and immortal memory. . . . The black north and true blue bible. Croppies lie down.\"",
    "expandedNote": " The phrase was coined in 1886 by Lord Randolph Henry Spencer-Churchill (1849-95), a British aristocrat and Conservative parliamentarian with no particular connection to Ireland. Churchill fiercely opposed Gladstone's Home Rule policy and attacked it in some passionate speeches in Ulster. Thornton notes that Churchill's son and biographer, Winston, wrote that \"The jingling phrase, 'Ulster will fight, and Ulster will be right,' was everywhere caught up. It became one of the war-cries of the time and sped with spirit-speed all over the country.\"\n As Thornton also notes, the name \"Ulster\" is ambiguous. Churchill used his phrase to appeal to the reactionary Protestants in cities like Belfast and Londonderry, and the northern part of Ireland that has remained in the UK since independence in 1922 is now often called Ulster. But Ulster is larger than Northern Ireland. It is one of the four ancient provinces of Ireland, and until the plantations of the 17th century it was the most Gaelic part of Ireland. Three of its nine counties elected to join the Republic at independence. County Donegal is particularly notable as a very Catholic and Gaelic part of Ulster that would not have rallied to the anti-nationalist sentiments of Churchill's jingoistic warcry."

    "note": " Molly recalls a visit to Gibraltar of \"general Ulysses Grant whoever he was or did supposed to be some great fellow.\" Grant (1822-85), one of the greatest figures of American military and political history, did pay such a visit in November 1878, a year and a half after the completion of his second term as U.S. President. At that time Molly would have been 8 years old.",
    "expandedNote": " Grant's strategic genius and iron determination in leading the Union armies to ultimate victory in America's civil war led to his election as the youngest President in American history in 1868. He reversed former President Andrew Johnson's drift toward the interests of southern whites, creating the Department of Justice to suppress the Ku Klux Klan and directing troops to enforce national law in the states of the former Confederacy. He also pursued peace with Native American tribes, mended fences with Great Britain and Spain, and promoted trade with other nations. \n After leaving the hugely undesired office of the presidency in March 1877 Grant began a world tour that would last for two and a half years and bring him and his rising nation international acclaim. Jubilant crowds in various European cities greeted \"General Grant\" as the great military leader that he had proved himself to be, the \"hero of Appomattox\"—though he declined all such boasting, presenting himself as a man of peace. U.S. naval vessels carried him to many of his destinations, and he conducted several unofficial diplomatic embassies on behalf of new President Rutherford B. Hayes, including intervention in some disputes between countries. \n In visits to important English personages in June 1878 it was decided as a matter of protocol (innovative at that time) that Grant was still President of the United States. Gifford observes that this status, when he visited Gibraltar later in the year, \"technically would have merited a twenty-one-gun salute,\" which may explain Molly's association of the general's visit with \"their damn guns bursting and booming all over the shop especially the Queens birthday and throwing everything down in all directions if you didnt open the windows.\" \n It seems likely that Joyce chose to include Grant in his novel at least in part because of the accident of his first name. Named Hiram Ulysses Grant by his parents, he decided early on to call himself Ulysses. During a part of the world tour in which he explored the Mediterranean Sea, stopping at Naples, Palermo, Malta, Alexandria, Jerusalem, Constantinople, and Athens, Grant often read aloud from a translation of Homer's Odyssey. In the Holy Land he met with a group of American Jews who were there to distribute aid to oppressed Palestinian Jews and promised to help their cause when he returned to the United States—qualifying him, perhaps, as an honorary \"greekjew.\" \n The tour also took him to Dublin in January 1879. Irish attitudes toward the great man seem to have been mixed. A Methodist, he had expressed sympathy for America's anti-Catholic Know Nothing movement in the 1850s, and Tom Deignan observes in a 22 July 2017 short piece on www.irishcentral.com that Catholic members of the Cork City Town Council objected to his visiting their city, prompting him to visit Belfast instead. But his great-grandfather had emigrated from County Tyrone in the 1730s, and he expressed support for the Fenian movement. \"Grant, ultimately, was embraced by the Irish,\" Deignan reports."

  "010148uncleanloins": {
    "note": " Stephen recalls church teaching about female sexuality when he thinks in Telemachus of \"woman's unclean loins, of man's flesh made not in God's likeness, the serpent's prey,\" and again in Proteus when he thinks of Eve's \"Womb of sin.\" Thornton notes the reference to passages in Leviticus that describe women’s genitals as being “unclean” during menstruation and childbirth. The other details come from the creation myth in Genesis.",
    "expandedNote": " Leviticus expresses rank revulsion at sexuality, abominating all the “discharges” of the human body as equivalent to contagious diseases, and reserving particular horror for the leaky female vessel. (Chapter 15 makes especially engrossing reading.) Misogynistic traditions in medieval Christianity, when Catholic doctrine was being formed, perpetuated these ancient taboos and joined them with condemnations of Eve. \n Stephen’s willingness to repeat these slurs is moderately appalling: however ignorant of female psychology he may have been in A Portrait, he was never misogynistic until now. But he is very much a product of the Irish Catholic church, the most fiercely body-hating of all European churches. A Portrait shows his precocious sexual blooming, his pious attempts to subdue every urge of his physical nature, and his final choice of sexuality over religion. But the process is dialectical rather than binary, and Ulysses finds him seeking sexual happiness witha mind still full of Catholic habits.\n [2012] Joyce's own trajectory was not much different. It was not until he met Nora Barnacle that he began to find his way out of the Catholic association of sexuality with sin. Louis Menand writes, in \"Silence, Exile, and Punning\" (The New Yorker, July 2, 2012), that when Nora went out walking with him on June 16, 1904, and gave him a hand job, Jim was awestruck.\" Joyce had known only prostitutes and proper middle-class girls. Nora was something new, an ordinary woman who treated him as an ordinary man. The moral simplicity of what happened between them seems to have stunned him. It was elemental, a gratuitous act of loving that had not involved flattery or deceit, and that was unaccompanied by shame or guilt. That simplicity became the basis of their relationship.\"\n JH 2011"

  "010005ungirdled": {
    "note": " The two un- words applied to Mulligan at the beginning of Telemachusemphasize his very un-priestly nature as he imitates the actions of a priest. His dressinggown is \"ungirdled,\" and his hair is \"untonsured.\"",
    "expandedNote": " The gown is ungirdled simply because Mulligan has not tied the cloth belt around his waist. But a priest's vestments are secured with a similar cloth band with tassels on the ends, called a cincture, and as the priest puts on the cincture he recites a prayer with the line, “Gird me, o Lord, with the girdle of purity.” Gifford plausibly infers that a dressinggown lacking the girdle of purity “suggests violation of the priestly vow of chastity.” Like his real-life counterpart Gogarty, Mulligan is an enthusiastic brothel-goer.\n \"Tonsure\" derives from a Latin verb meaning to shear or shave. It refers to the part of a priest's or monk's head that is shaved, often just prior to taking holy orders. In Proteus Stephen thinks of priests \"moving burly in their albs, tonsured and oiled and gelded.\" (The \"alb\" is the priest's white vestment, from the Latin word for white, alba.) Here again, the un-word applied to Mulligan suggests lack of reverence for the rite he is so blasphemously imitating."

    "note": " The \"United Irishman\" was a weekly newspaper founded by Arthur Griffith and William Rooney in 1899. It appeared every Thursday until the government shut it down with the pressure of a libel suit in 1906. (It was reincarnated as Sinn Féin, which lasted until the government shut that down in 1914.) In a 6 September 1906 letter to his brother Stanislaus, Joyce remarked that this nationalist publication was the only Irish newspaper of any \"pretensions\" to real value, but he attacked Rooney's poetry in 1902, and his parody of Griffith's writing in Cyclops is at best ambivalent.",
    "expandedNote": " When Alice Milligan and Anna Johnston closed their monthly paper, the Shan Van Vocht, in 1899 they gave Griffith and Rooney their subscription lists, so The United Irishman became a kind of successor to that earlier vehicle of passionate nationalism. The new paper did not represent so-called advanced nationalism, i.e. militant advocacy for a separate state. Instead it advocated returning to something like the state of affairs before the Act of Union: an Ireland governed by its own Parliament but loyal to the British King. \n In the complacent landscape of turn-of-the-century Irish newspapers, this counted as a fairly radical position. Griffith strongly opposed the second Boer War and Britain's recruitment of Ireland's young men to fight that war. In Lotus Eaters Bloom admires the paper's willingness to take on the (non-)curfew policy that allowed British soldiers to cruise Dublin's streets at night looking for sex: \"Maud Gonne’s letter about taking them off O’Connell street at night: disgrace to our Irish capital. Griffith’s paper is on the same tack now: an army rotten with venereal disease: overseas or halfseasover empire.\" The paper also advocated for the development and protection of an independent Irish economy, continuing one major theme of the anti-colonialist Shan Van Vocht.\n William Rooney died young in 1901, and in 1902 Griffith published some of his patriotic poems in the United Irishman. Joyce penned an unsympathetic review of those poems which appeared in the 11 December 1902 Daily Express, referring (amidst much other less memorable criticism) to \"those big words which make us so unhappy.\" This irreverence perhaps carried over into the reading that Joyce has the Citizen perform in Cyclops: \"Did you read that skit in the United Irishman today about that Zulu chief that's visiting England?\" A long paragraph is given over to a funny and winningly anti-imperialist, but also deeply racist, account of a meeting in England between some Manchester cotton traders and the \"Alaki,\" the king of a Nigerian tribe.\n John Wyse Nolan asks, \"Is that by Griffith?\" \"No,\" replies the Citizen, \"It's not signed Shanganagh. It's only initialled: P.\" Gifford notes that Griffith \"did write 'skits' of the sort quoted,\" at first under the pseudonym \"Shanganagh\" (which may mean \"a friendly conversation,\" according to P. W. Joyce in English as We Speak It in Ireland), but also later as \"P\" (\"for the spirit of Parnell?,\" Gifford speculates). If one reads these details as suggesting that Griffith did author the piece, its racism makes sense in light of the fact that Griffith supported black slavery. (The Citizen is no better: after he and his cronies abhor the horrors of Belgian imperialist practices in the Congo, he proceeds to refer to Bloom as \"that whiteeyed kaffir.\")\n But the \"skit\" presented as a feature in the day's United Irishman in fact never appeared in that paper, or any other. Joyce constructed it as a parody of the kind of thing that Griffith might write, but he took the incidents from stories in another newspaper, the outspokenly pro-Empire London Times. As John Nash notes in \"'Hanging over the bloody paper': newspapers and imperialism in Ulysses,\" an essay collected in Modernism and Empire (Manchester UP, 2000), ed. Howard J. Booth and Nigel Rigby, \"The Timescarried several reports of the Alake's visit to England in May-June 1904,\" and many details in those reports show up in Joyce's anti-imperialist parody (190-91). Nash observes that the skit's \"peculiar mix of fact and fiction displays Joyce's careful moulding of the imperialist Times into its direct opposite, a humorous and anti-imperial newspaper\" (189).\n The humor and anti-imperialism may perhaps be seen as honoring Griffith, but the racism almost certainly cannot. Bloom's poignant experience of racial prejudice in Cyclops, and his refusal to think in such terms himself, provide a powerful counterweight to supposing that the text is asking its readers to join the pub crew in laughing about a blub-lipped, fancy-dancing, sycophantish, cannibalistic, \"dusky potentate.\" It must be said, however, that the totality of representations of black people (and white imitators of black people) in Ulysses makes this judgment open to question.\n JH 2018"

  "080010upup": {
    "note": " The postcard that Josie Breen's husband has received in the mail apparently says only \"U. P.\" She supplies the uncomprehending Bloom with an interpretive gloss: \"U. P.: up, she said.\" While this detail has remained a notorious enigma in Joyce studies for decades, its principal meaning seems clear: Dennis Breen is finished, quite possibly mortally. The specific implication may be that he is suffering from a serious mental illness.",
    "expandedNote": " Under adverbial meanings of \"up,\" the OED lists several 19th century uses of the word to mean \"Come to a fruitless or undesired end; 'played out'. Usu. with game\" (as in the expression \"the game is up\") or, even more to the point, \"All up, completely done or finished; quite over. Also All UP (yū pī).\" \n The usage is also recorded in John Camden Hotten's Dictionary of Modern Slang, Cant, and Vulgar Words, first published in 1859. In a gloss on James Joyce Online Notes, John Simpson notes that \"Hotten was the slang lexicographer of the mid-nineteenth century,\" and quotes his entry: \"UP, […] it’s all UP with him\", i.e., it is all over with him, often pronounced U.P., naming the two letters separately.\" In Surface and Symbol, Robert Martin Adams quotes from a later edition of Hotten's dictionary: \"when pronounced U.P., naming the two letters separately, the expression means 'settled' or 'done'\" (193). \n The OED cites several early literary examples, including J. W. Warter's The Last of the Old Squires (London, 1854), in which the eponymous protagonist maintains that \"It's all UP—up\" is a corruption of an older expression from the English Midlands, \"It is all O.P.,\" referring to Orthodox (Catholic) and Puritan sects (87). \n But the citation that seems most relevant to Joyce is Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist (serialized 1837-39), where the expression refers to a health emergency. In chapter 24 several women and \"the parish apothecary's apprentice\" attend the bed of a sick woman in a grim attic room. When their conversation is interrupted by a moan from the patient, the apothecary's deputy says that she will be dead soon: \"‘Oh!’ said the young mag, turning his face towards the bed, as if he had previously quite forgotten the patient, ‘it’s all U.P. there, Mrs. Corney.’ / ‘It is, is it, sir?’ asked the matron. / ‘If she lasts a couple of hours, I shall be surprised.’ said the apothecary’s apprentice, intent upon the toothpick’s point. ‘It’s a break-up of the system altogether.’\"\n This use of U.P. can be found in later publications. Simpson quotes from Ann Elizabeth Baker's Glossary of Northamptonshire Words (1854): \"'It's all U.P. with him'; i.e. all up either with his health, or circumstances.\" In Joyce's own time the application to health emergencies can be found in Arnold Bennett's novel The Old Wives' Tale (1908). In the fourth section of chapter 4 a doctor tries in vain to revive the comatose Sophia. He leaves the sickroom with Dick Povey and voices his professional opinion: \"On the landing out-side the bedroom, the doctor murmured to him: 'U.P.' And Dick nodded.\" Some hours later, Sophia dies. \n Joyce himself used the expression to refer to his disastrous eye problems. Simpson quotes from a letter he wrote to Valery Larbaud on 17 October 1928: \"Apparently I have completely overworked myself and if I don't get back sight to read it is all U-P up.\"\n The conclusion seems inescapable: the anonymous postcard is suggesting that Dennis Breen's life is falling apart, probably because of failing health. As to the nature of the health problems, the characters of the novel clearly think that he is losing his wits. When Bloom urges Josie to observe the behavior of the lunatic Farrell, she says, \"Denis will be like that one of these days.\" His actions on June 16—tramping through the streets of Dublin, weighed down by bulky legal tomes, to find a solicitor willing to lodge a libel action against an anonymous perpetrator, for the unimaginable sum of £10,000—hardly help to dispel the impression.\n In Cyclops Alf Bergan (who Bloom thinks may have sent the postcard) describes Breen as a raving lunatic, and J. J. O'Molloy (who is himself a solicitor) is quick to recognize that Breen's deranged activity will only confirm the charge of insanity that he is trying to defend himself against: \"—Did you see that bloody lunatic Breen round there? says Alf. U. P: up. . . . / —Of course an action would lie, says J. J. It implies that he is not compos mentis. U. P: up. / —Compos your eye! says Alf, laughing. Do you know that he’s balmy? Look at his head. Do you know that some mornings he has to get his hat on with a shoehorn.\"\n Despite the strong evidence that the postcard is commenting on Breen's mental health, readers have sought out other possible meanings. Some are perhaps loosely compatible with the \"you're finished\" hypothesis—notably one mentioned by Gifford, that there is an allusion to \"the initials that precede the docket numbers in Irish cemeteries.\" This interpretation has the advantage of connecting with one textual detail in the novel. In Circe, the caretaker of the Glasnevin cemetery, John O'Connell, refers to Paddy Dignam's grave with an absurd series of identifying numbers: \"Burial docket letter number U. P. eightyfive thousand. Field seventeen. House of Keys. Plot, one hundred and one.\"\n But the roads most traveled have been sexual and excretory, prompted by reading U.P. as \"you pee.\" Adams, whose 1962 book was perhaps the first critical study to seriously address the phrase, includes among five possible readings the meanings You urinate, You're no good, You put your fingers up your anus, and You can't get it up any more. Only the first of these can be connected very clearly to the letters on the page. Gifford notes that Richard Ellmann proposed the more ingenious but physiologically bizarre reading, \"When erect you urinate rather than ejaculate.\" An entire M.A. thesis, Leah Harper Bowron's The Pusillanimous Denis: What \"U.P.: Up\" Really Means (University of Alabama, 2013) has been devoted to the even more bizarre claim that Breen suffers from hypospadias, a congenital condition in which the male urethra opens on the underside of the penis. \n Against these speculations about Breen's private parts, Simpson sensibly objects that the novel's contexts do not cooperate with such scabrous inferences: \"From the internal dynamics of Ulysses and from the social etiquette of the day (would Mrs Breen show Molly's husband a postcard with a virtually unspeakable obscenity?) we might regard the “You pee up” interpretation, which has sometimes found favour, to be laboured.\" \n Simpson adds that the crudely physical and irreverent Molly thinks about the postcard and says nothing about Breen's genital equipment: \"After the I-narrator of 'Cyclops' Molly has perhaps the most slanderous tongue in Ulysses. And yet she passes up the opportunity to make a malicious comment on the supposedly obscene allusion behind the wording of Breen’s postcard. She simply regards him as a forlorn-looking spectacle of a husband who is mad enough on occasions to go to bed with his boots on. This is in keeping with the way in which Breen is regarded generally in the novel—the cronies in Cyclops collapse with laughter at his lunatic behaviour, not because of some urinary or sexual irregularity.\"\n Joyce did not invent the use of postcards to lodge hurtful personal attacks. As Natalie Zarrelli observes in a February 2017 post on atlasobscura.com, one subgenre of the insult postcard, the \"vinegar valentine,\" goes back at least to the 1840s. People in the U.K. and the U.S. bought mass-produced expressions of romantic disesteem and sent them anonymously on Valentine's Day. By Joyce's time other such cards targeted disagreeable salespeople, doctors, and suffragists. \n At some point individuals began to be addressed simply for their general insufficiency as human beings. The recent artistic efforts of Mr. Bingo in England, some of which are reproduced here, show that this tradition is alive and well today. It may very well have been alive in Joyce's lifetime. In Surface and Symbol Adams observes that \"on p. 2 of the Freeman's Journal for Thursday, November 5, 1903, appeared a report of a suit in which one McKettrick sued a man named Kiernan, for having sent him a libelous postcard\" (193)."

  "010054ursula": {
    "note": " Mulligan says that he stole his shaving mirror from \"the skivvy's room\" in his parents' house. \"Skivvy\" is British slang for a female servant who does menial domestic labor like housecleaning—not far from the role of dogsbody that Mulligan has just assigned to Stephen. To the injury of stealing possessions from this very poor woman, Mulligan adds an insult about her looks and behavior: \"The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi. Lead him not into temptation. And her name is Ursula.\" Ursula was a 3rd century Christian martyr passionately devoted to virginity.",
    "expandedNote": " Thornton notes the relevant fact that Alban Butler's Lives of the Saints (New York, 1846) proclaimed that Ursula \"is regarded as a model and patroness by those who undertake to train up youth in the sentiments and practice of piety and religion.\" Unsurprisingly, Mulligan would prefer not to be trained up.\n According to legend, the Cornish princess Ursula recruited 11,000 virgins to undertake a pilgrimage around Europe promoting virginity; and, supposedly, the Huns slaughtered all of them at Cologne. Scholars have speculated that, if the legend was based on any history at all, the truly impressive number of dispatched virgins probably derived from a misreading, in the 9th century, of historical records from the 5th century that mentioned anywhere from two to eleven martyrs. One possibility is that XI. M. V., referring to eleven martyred virgins, was misread as eleven thousand virgins, since M is the Roman symbol for 1,000. In Cyclops, when Martin Cunningham's remark, \"God bless all here is my prayer,\" conjures up a hoard of \"mitred abbots and priors and guardians and monks and friars,\" the bloated procession concludes with the appearance of \"S. Ursula with eleven thousand virgins.\""
  },
  "010137usurper": {
    "note": " Telemachus concludes with an epiphanic snippet of interior monologue that crystallizes Stephen's thoughts about the man who has just \"called to him from the sea.\" \"Usurper\" implies that, like Telemachus and Hamlet, Stephen feels deprived of his rightful place by a malicious interloper. He may not be thinking of princes deposed in their royal palaces, but he has reason for feeling usurped at this moment, and readers have reason to think of the Odyssey and Hamlet, because Mulligan has just taken from him the key to the tower that evokes those palaces. The recognition implied by this one word leads to many others.",
    "expandedNote": " Telemachus began with narration that hovered about Mulligan's gaily performative ego, interrupted occasionally by unvoiced grudges from Stephen. This drama persists at the end of the chapter, but much has happened in the interim, including a struggle over living arrangements precipitated by Haines' night terrors. Although Mulligan offers to send his Oxford chum packing, Stephen correctly intuits that it is not Haines who has worn out his welcome: \"He wants that key. It is mine. I paid the rent. Now I eat his salt bread. Give him the key too. All. He will ask for it. That was in his eyes.\" Mulligan gets the key, he chummily disparages Stephen to the new roommate in Wandering Rocks, and he returns to the tower with Haines at the end of the day, having given Stephen the slip. Stephen is homeless on June 16, and he knows it. In a personal communication, Doug Pope notes that he has essentially received an eviction notice: \"It is only when Mulligan takes back his house key that Stephen gets the full import of the message: he's no longer wanted, he's been replaced by a new houseguest with better manners.\" \n This physical displacement no doubt focuses Stephen's sense of being coopted and displaced in other ways. Mulligan has insinuated himself into a position of authority in his life (a life whose credo is evading subjection) and uses it to demean and impeach the young artist he purports to be nurturing. In Circe, as Stephen approaches the climax of desperation signaled by his mother's ghoulish return from the dead, he cries out against his \"foes,\" one in particular: \"Break my spirit, will he?\" He does not name this person, but it can only be Buck. The word \"usurper,\" which typically refers to rulers, offices, and powers, also suggests that Stephen is nurturing political grievances. Haines stands in for the English nation that has usurped Irish autonomy for more than 700 years, and Mulligan, who chooses this patronizing English tourist over Stephen, stands in for a treacherous Irish nation that has always betrayed its leaders. \n No doubt more could be said about the psychological and political implications of Stephen's word, but it also implies that Mulligan has coopted the artistic role of one of the three principal characters of Ulysses. So sullen, withdrawn, reactive, and inert is Stephen in the opening chapter, so ebullient, charming, and active is Mulligan, that many readers new to the book must struggle to decide who is the protagonist and who the antagonist. The inversion of roles goes far beyond differences of temperament. At the beginning of this great comic novel, Mulligan is funny and Stephen mostly is not. In an encyclopedic narrative that alludes to everything under the sun, displays vast learning, and finds classic literary archetypes in modern Irish life, Malachi the messenger leads the way in announcing these glad tidings, not Stephen.\n In his critical study Ulysses, Hugh Kenner notes these displacements: \"So ready indeed is Mulligan with quotations, one would think he, not Stephen, was the littérateur in residence. It is he, moreover, who introduces theme after theme. His first words introduce, at six removes, the Jew in exile. His next quotation is from Homer’s Greek. It is he, not Stephen, who intones the song from Yeats that will attend Stephen like a leitmotif. He invokes Swinburne, mocks Wilde, alludes (in a German word) to Nietzsche. . . . Whether playing Christ as he drops his gown . . . or playing the Fool . . . or conjuring up mock-Gothic spooks to make half-drunken medicals roar with delight . . . always on stage, the stately plump Buck in his primrose vest . . . plays parts like a chameleon and plays onlookers like fish (‘Why don’t you play them as I do?’) in roistering affirmation of Mulligan’s Law, the first principle of Dublin, that all is style, is appearances, is show\" (36-37). \n Later chapters show that Stephen, although ambivalent about playing audiences for laughs, possesses all of the substance falsely promised by Mulligan's flashy performances. But in Telemachus this capaciousness is scarcely visible in him. Kenner identifies the cause: \"Mulligan usurps Stephen’s place, stage-centre; usurps, with his mockery, Stephen’s anguished unbelief; usurps, quoting classroom Greek and facile Swinburne, the office of the Hellenising bard\" (37). Mulligan has rented a decommissioned military tower to be theomphalos that will bring ancient literary greatness to birth in modern Ireland; his model, Oliver Gogarty, said the aim was to \"house the Bard,\" James Joyce. But while living there Stephen has watched the cherished materials of his art aped and debased into mere clownery, and now he finds himself turned out altogether. At the end of A Portrait of the Artist he aspired to merit the name of Dedalus. Here, that patrimonial claim appears to have been taken from him."

  "030149vampire": {
    "note": " In an odd amalgamation of literary borrowings, Stephen fusesDouglas Hyde's romantic west-of-Ireland \"mouth to my mouth\" with a gothic vampire motif: \"He comes, pale vampire, through storm his eyes, his bat sails bloodying the sea, mouth to her mouth's kiss.\" This prose revery in Proteus ripens into a rhymed quatrain before Stephen leaves the strand (though the lines are withheld from the reader until Aeolus), and he continues thinking about vampires in Oxen of the Sun and Circe. His principal source is clearly fellow Dubliner Bram Stoker.",
    "expandedNote": " The lines that Stephen writes down on a scrap of Deasy's letter as he sits on the rocks, and calls to mind in the newspaper office, eliminate the bat image but preserve the idea of a sea voyage:\n On swift sail flaming\n From storm and south,\n He comes, pale vampire,\n Mouth to my mouth.\n The sailing ship is one clue to the influence of Stoker, who was born in Clontarf in 1847 and worked in Dublin as a young man before marrying and moving to London in 1878. His gothic novel Dracula (1897) tells the story of a vampire who leaves his native Transylvania to find un-dead victims abroad. Dracula boards a Russian schooner, the Demeter, which departs from a port on the Black Sea. By the time the ship runs aground on the northeastern coast of England \"with all sails set\" in a sudden, tremendously violent storm, all the crew are dead.\n Stephen's \"From storm and south\" evokes the ship's journey north from the Mediterranean and the intense tempest at its conclusion. His \"bloodying the sea\" may have been inspired by the supernatural terror that drove the crew to suicide, caused the captain to lash himself to the helm, and brought the ship to England as a ghostly hulk. Several details from this point forward in the novel also seem to have spoken to Stephen. A huge dog or wolf leaps from the ship's hold and runs ashore, later declaring its presence by eviscerating a mastiff. Having shown his ability to assume animal shapes, Dracula appears several times in the night sky as \"a great bat\" that lands on windowsills of the house where Mina Murray and Lucy Westenra are staying. The novel emphasizes his red \"eyes,\" and he and his female victims call their bloody bites a \"kiss.\"\n It is fitting that the bat allusion should occur in Proteus, given Stephen's preoccupation with animals and shapeshifting in that chapter. Stoker did not invent this detail—Varney the Vampire, serialized in weekly penny dreadfuls and published as a book in 1847, had featured illustrations of vampiric beings with bat-like wings—but he made it one of the most memorable features of his vampire. One other work may lie behind Stephen's phrase \"bat sails,\" which so strangely fuses two elements that exist unconnected in Dracula. In an article titled \"How Stephen Wrote His Vampire Poem,\" JJQ 17.2 (1980): 183-97, Robert Adams Day points to a drawing in a book which Joyce owned, W. T. Horton's A Book of Images (1898). Horton's symbolist image shows a terrified or terrifying man, immersed in ocean waves, whose shoulders sprout \"two huge wings or sails,\" like \"the wings of a bat\" or \"the sails of an Oriental vessel\" (192). \n § The vampiric bat coheres with other morbid animal figures of Stephen's imagination: the humanized dog digging in the sand in Proteus, the fox digging up his dead grandmother in Nestor, Haines' black panther, Stephen's maternal \"Ghoul\" (identified with a \"Hyena\" in Circe), the \"lemur\" of Circe. These nightmarish grave-robbing figures infuse demonic intelligence with terrifying animal energy, just as vampires do. But vampires embody the additional quality of sexual hunger, and whenever Stephen thinks of them it is in the context of sexual interaction. \n As he sits on the rocks in Proteus, looking at a couple that he imagines to be prostitute and pimp, and longing for a woman's touch and kiss, Stephen imagines the kiss being given by a \"pale vampire.\" Later, in Oxen of the Sun, he speaks of the \"potency of vampires mouth to mouth\" as one possible avenue to pregnancy. (Vampires do not have this \"potency,\" but as Gifford notes, \"another demon of the night, the incubus, was supposed to impregnate sleeping women.\") In Circe the Parisian sex show barker that he mimes for his comparnions' amusement advertises a vampire act: \"All chic womans which arrive full of modesty then disrobe and squeal loud to see vampire man debauch nun very fresh young with dessous troublants.\" (The French means something like \"disturbing lower parts,\" though Gifford translates it as \"disordered underclothes.\") Lynch provides a chorus: \"Vive le vampire!\" \n Many forces seem to converge in Stephen's vampire sexuality. The prostitution context of his Proteus revery expresses his Catholic linkage of sex with sinfulness, and the sharing of blood in the vampire's kiss may trigger his related fantasy that Eve's original sin is passed down to all human beings by anastomosis. This poisonous linkage between religious proscription and female sexuality has been intensified by guilt over his refusal to pray at his mother's deathbed, which may explain the resemblance between the animalistic vampire (wolf, bat) and the grave-robbing animals of Stephen's imagination (fox, dog, hyena-ghoul). \n But in addition to stoking horror of the female body, vampires seem to feed Stephen's defiance of God. Stoker and other writers had characterized the vampire as demonic—in Dracula, communion wafers are placed in his coffins of Transylvanian soil to neutralize their power, and people endlessly cross themselves to hold off the evil influence. Stephen, like his creator, identifies with the devil. His fantasy of a vampire debauching a nun expresses Luciferian defiance as clearly as does the Non serviam! that he shouts at his clinging ghoul of a mother later in Circe.\n At the end of Circe, as he lies unconscious and Bloom's cries call him back from the depths, Stephen's final mention of the vampire could be read as self-identification. Bloom has been shouting his name: \"Eh! Ho! (There is no answer; he bends again.) Mr Dedalus! (There is no answer.) The name if you call. Somnambulist.(He bends again and hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form.) Stephen! (There is no answer. He calls again.) Stephen!\" In response to all these hollerings of his name Stephen asks, \"Who? Black panther. Vampire,\" as if to say that he has been inhabiting the unconscious dark with those monsters.\n But a more plausible construction of the passage, which most readers seem to adopt, is that Stephen wonders who is calling him, sees a pale-faced figure dressed all in black bending over him as if to bite his neck, and thinks of him as a vampire. Apparently he has already been imagining Bloom as a black panther, because at the end of Scylla and Charybdis, after Mulligan warns him about the man and Bloom passes between them, the free indirect narration reads, \"A dark back went before them, step of a pard, down, out by the gateway,\" picking up on the phrase that Stephen had used in Proteus: \"a pard, a panther, got in spousebreach, vulturing the dead.\" Even with Gabler's sensible insertion of a period between \"Black panther\" and \"Vampire,\" this effectively links the two figures with each other and with Bloom. \n In \"Ulysses' Black Panther Vampire,\" JJQ 13.4 (1976): 415-27 (written when all print editions lacked the period), Michael Seidel suggests that Stephen may refuse the offer of a room for the night because he sees Bloom as a vampiric figure with unhealthy designs on him. Having caught Bloom looking between a museum goddess' buttocks, Mulligan has leeringly insinuated that he is \"Greeker than the Greeks\": \"O, Kinch, thou art in peril. Get thee a breechpad.\" There is no reason to think that Bloom is turned on by young men, or that his attitude toward Stephen is predatory. After the breechpad remark, Stephen seems to attribute the homoerotic interests to Mulligan himself: \"Manner of Oxenford.\" But perhaps an idea has been planted in his mind. \n More to the point, several details in the novel suggest that Bloom's fantasy of having Stephen lodge in his house includes an intimate connection with Molly. Perhaps Stephen glimpses this train of thought in Eumaeus, when Bloom shows him a photo of his wife in a manner that could be construed as pandering. Seidel infers from Bloom's fantasy of substituting Stephen for Boylan that Stephen may somehow see the offer of a bed at 7 Eccles as \"a means of infusing life into the corpse of a marriage\" (425). By this reading, Stephen has no interest in being procured to satisfy another man's wife. Giving his young blood to relieve a mature couple's frustrations would be all too like the story of the Jew's daughter.\n Such inferences about Stephen's psychology are speculative. But it is easy to imagine this romantically idealistic young man being reluctant to fulfill someone else's fantasy of triangulation. Sexual apprehensions aside, there can be little doubt that he is not yet sure that Bloom deserves such an important role in his life. The novel has coyly brought the two men's paths closer and closer together without quite demonstrating the basis for a close friendship. Seeing Bloom as a vampire at the end of Circe coheres with Stephen's sullen standoffishness toward him during the first part of Eumaeus, which that chapter aligns with the Homeric symbolism of a son not recognizing his disguised father. By the time the two men stand urinating under the stars, gazing up at the bedroom light of \"an invisible attractive person,\" they are clearly much closer. But readers cannot know whether an Eccles Street Trinity may actually come to be, or whether it is destined to remain a figment of Bloom's lonely imagination."

    "note": " As Deasy sits typing his magisterial letter to the editor and reading aloud from it, Stephen takes a seat \"before the princely presence\" of Albert Edward and surveys the framed \"images of vanished horses\" that grace the walls. Three are named: \"Repulse,\" who won a race at Newmarket, England in 1866; \"Shotover,\" who won five races starting in 1882 and nearly claimed the English Triple Crown; and \"Ceylon,\" who did in fact win the Grand \"prix de Paris, 1866.\" Stephen thinks again of the \"Prix de Paris\" near the end of Proteus.",
    "expandedNote": " The text places Stephen in two kinds of relationship to these British thoroughbreds. He lets his mind drift in fantasy to a racetrack where \"Elfin riders,\" i.e. featherweight jockeys, sit atop their mounts \"watchful of a sign.\" He imagines himself seeing \"their speeds\" once the race has begun, and shouting along \"with the shouts of vanished crowds.\" But at the same time Stephen is sitting \"\"noiselessly\" in Deasy's office, looking at the static portraits of equine elegance, and a portrait of the English king, and his Unionist employer. The horses themselves seem to be silently contemplating their lords and masters \"in homage, their meek heads poised in air.\" \n Gifford notes that Albert Edward \"was an ardent horse fancier,\" and that the horses displayed on the walls of the study implicitly associate Deasy with \"Nestor, master charioteer.\" The narrative also explicitly identifies the owners of the three horses as lords (a marquis and two dukes), so we have in sum a collection of five princely presences before whom the shabby Stephen may wish to humble himself in homage.\n Thornton supplies details about the owners, as does Gifford."

  "050004venerealdisease": {
    "note": " The recruiting poster for the Royal Dublins that Bloom sees on a wall of the post office makes him think of \"an army rotten with venereal disease.\" The efforts of people like Maud Gonne and Arthur Griffith to get British soldiers off the streets at night may have overhyped this rallying cry, but it is a fact that Dublin brothels and streetwalkers did a brisk trade in servicing servicemen. And Bloom's thoughts throughout the day suggest that venereal diseases from gonorrhea to syphilis were widespread in the city.",
    "expandedNote": " Gifford remarks that Bloom's canard is \"A frequently quoted (and largely unfounded) bit of demagoguery at the British army's expense.\" But Dublin had by far the largest red-light district in Europe, and its size corresponded to the huge numbers of troops stationed in barracks throughout the city. The curators of the website at www.census.nationalarchives.ie observe that \"The presence of so many prostitutes was determined, at least in part, by the significant military presence in the city. And the military do not seem to have disappointed prostitutes seeking business, judging by the inmates of the isolation ward at the Royal Military Infirmary\" (accessed 28 Nov. 2013). It would seem that the trade in sexually transmitted diseases was brisk.\n Oliver St. John Gogarty wrote a brilliant \"Ode to Welcome\" Irish regiments returning from the Second Boer War. Cyril Pearl notes that it was published anonymously \"in Dublin's leading—and most snobbish—society magazine.\"\n The Gallant Irish yeoman,\n Home from the war has come\n Each victory gained o'er foeman,\n Why should our bards be dumb?\n How shall we sing their praises\n Or glory in their deeds?\n Renowned their worth amazes,\n Empire their prowess needs.\n So to Old Ireland's hearts and homes\n We welcome now our own brave boys\n In cot and hall; 'neath lordly domes\n Love's heroes share once more our joys.\n Love is the Lord of all just now,\n Be he the husband, lover, son,\n Each dauntless soul recalls the vow\n By which not fame, but love was won.\n United now in fond embrace\n Salute with joy each well-loved face,\n Yeoman, in women's hearts you hold the place. \n \"There was an unprecedented demand for the magazine,\" Pearl observes, \"when the intelligence was flashed through Dublin pubs and clubs that the initial letters of each line spelled out a less rapturous acrostic: THE WHORES WILL BE BUSY\" (Dublin in Bloomtime, 14).\n Bloom's concern about sexually transmitted diseases resurfaces again and again, from his alarm in Lestrygonians that Boylan might give one to Molly (\"If he...? / O! / Eh? / No... No. / No, no. I don't believe it. He wouldn't surely? / No, no\"), to Zoe's alarm in Circe (perhaps hallucinated) that he has \"a hard chancre\" on his penis, to the dismay he expresses to Stephen in Eumaeus that the streetwalker he sees going past the shelter (\"a wretched creature like that from the Lock hospital, reeking with disease\") can be brazen enough to solicit business, to his opinion in Ithaca that brothels should be \"state inspected and medically controlled.\""

  "080005venus": {
    "note": " Bloom thinks of Greek goddesses, and particularly statues of Venus, as embodying the objects of male desire in ideal proportions. One statue associated with his delectation, in Scylla and Charybdis, is \"Venus Kallipyge,\" whose name means Venus of the Beautiful Buttocks—or, in contemporary American parlance, Venus with the Nice Ass. Mulligan names this work after he encounters Bloom gazing at the backside of a plaster reproduction in the National Museum of Ireland. Thoughts of ancient statuary figure at several other points in the novel, collectively suggesting a different aesthetic than the one propounded by Stephen Dedalus in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.",
    "expandedNote": " In 1904 the National Museum, located across a courtyard from the externally identical National Library, displayed 77 plaster casts of famous Greek and Roman statues in its entrance rotunda. One of these plaster reproductions was of some imitative version of Praxiteles' Venus, a very famous lost work of the 4th century BCE in which the goddess modestly covers her private parts with her right hand. It seems that the museum also displayed a copy of the Venus Callipyge or Kallipygos, a less demure work from the 1st or 2nd century BCE in the which the goddess lifts her tunic to give the audience a good view of her buttocks. \n In \"'Museum With Those Goddesses': Bloom and the Dublin Plaster Casts,\" Dublin James Joyce Journal 2 (2009): 24-38, Fintan Cullen observes that \"On the evidence of a contemporaneous photograph from the William Lawrence studio of the interior display in the Dublin Museum’s rotunda, the placement of the cast against the wall of the rotunda would not have allowed Bloom much room in which to explore what Mulligan, a medical student, refers to as her ‘mesial groove’ (she is seen in the back row of the display of casts, with her left arm raised).\" Nevertheless, the novel asks us to imagine Bloom squinting between the goddess's buttocks to see if the sculptor has bothered to include an anus.\n His quest originates in Lestrygonians, when he thinks about the differences between mortal and divine diets: \"Shapely goddesses, Venus, Juno: curves the world admires. Can see them library museum standing in the round hall, naked goddesses. . . . Quaffing nectar at mess with gods golden dishes, all ambrosial. Not like a tanner lunch we have, boiled mutton, carrots and turnips, bottle of Allsop. Nectar imagine it drinking electricity: gods' food. Lovely forms of woman sculped Junonian. Immortal lovely. And we stuffing food in one hole and out behind: food, chyle, blood, dung, earth, food: have to feed it like stoking an engine. They have no. Never looked. I'll look today. Keeper won't see. Bend down let something fall see if she.\"\n At the end of Oxen of the Sun someone in the crush of the bar crowd, quite possibly Stephen Dedalus, mentions \"Venus Pandemos,\" another avatar of the goddess whose name means Venus of All the People. Aphrodite Pandemos was sometimes seen as the goddess of all Greece, but she was also the goddess of sexual delights and prostitution, as opposed to the \"heavenly\" Aphrodite Urania—and so the lusty young man's remark seems to anticipate coming adventures in the red light district. Venus Pandemos and her sister of the beautiful buttocks are mentioned together in Circe, as Bloom \"explains to those near him his schemes for social regeneration. All agree with him. The keeper of the Kildare Street Museum appears, dragging a lorry on which are the shaking statues of several naked goddesses, Venus Callipyge, Venus Pandemos, Venus Metempsychosis, and plaster figures, also naked, representing the new nine muses.\" \n In advocating for \"social regeneration\" through appreciation of classical sculpture, Bloom finds common cause with Buck Mulligan's program of \"Hellenising\" Ireland. In Oxen of the Sun, these two men of science discuss infant mortality and Mulligan envisions a role for statuary in promoting the health of expectant mothers and their babies: \"Kalipedia, he prophesied, would soon be generally adopted and all the graces of life, genuinely good music, agreeable literature, light philosophy, instructive pictures, plastercast reproductions of the classical statues such as Venus and Apollo, artistic coloured photographs of prize babies, all these little attentions would enable ladies who were in a particular condition to pass the intervening months in a most enjoyable manner.\" \n Bloom himself owns \"an image of Narcissus purchased by auction from P. A. Wren, 9 Bachelor's Walk (Ithaca)\"—a \"little statue,\" Bello notes, that \"you carried home in the rain for art for art's sake\" (Circe). Bloom derives no prurient pleasures from this male statue, but his wife does: \"those fine young men I could see down in Margate strand bathing place from the side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a God or something and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men like that thered be some consolation for a womanlike that lovely little statue he bought I could look at him all day long curly head and his shoulders his finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and poetry for you I often felt I wanted to kiss him all over also his lovely young cock there so simple I wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth if nobody was looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and white he looks with his boyish face.\" Somewhere in the course of this reverie the small statue merges in Molly's mind with Stephen Dedalus.\n The sexual desire that these statues excite in Bloom, Stephen, and Molly, together with Bloom's desire to imitate the standards of male beauty embodied in Eugen Sandow's exercises, make clear that by the time Joyce wrote his \"epic of the body\" he had reconsidered some of the aesthetic ideas voiced by Stephen inA Portrait. In part 5 of that work, Stephen tells Lynch that the emotions excited by art should be \"static,\" i.e. not moving one to action. The \"desire and loathing\" excited by pornographic or didactic works are \"unesthetic emotions not only because they are kinetic in character but also because they are not more than physical.\" \n A lusty Lynch plays the devil's advocate: \"You say that art must not excite desire, said Lynch. I told you that one day I wrote my name in pencil on the backside of the Venus of Praxitiles in the Museum. Was that not desire?\" Stephen dismisses this reaction: \"your flesh responded to the stimulus of a naked statue but it was, I say, simply a reflex action of the nerves.\" He advocates instead an Aquinian understanding of beauty as \"the splendor of truth,\" and uses Darwin as a straw man to debunk the notion that the beauty men see in women can be explained solely by desire for \"the propagation of the species.\" Lynch professes himself convinced when Stephen ridicules the idea that \"you admired the great flanks of Venus because you felt that she would bear you burly offspring and admired her great breasts because you felt that she would give good milk to her children and yours.\" \n By the time he wrote Ulysses Joyce clearly had thought better of Stephen's overly neat dichotomy between the physical and the spiritual. The statues in the mature novel engage characters' emotions in much more kinetic ways. In this connection it is worth mentioning that Praxitiles' lost Venus, which would have been painted, was reportedly so extraordinarily mimetic that, despite its modest pose and its function as a sacred temple statue, it aroused some ancient Greek men. Section 15 of the Erotes (a Greek dialogue written in the time of the Roman empire) tells the story of a young man who broke into the temple at night, \"embraced\" the statue (to use Molly's language), and left a stain on it."

  "030041likeawhale": {
    "note": " Phrases from Hamlet sound in Stephen's interior monologue repeatedly during Proteus—unsurprisingly, because the account of Shakespeare's life and works that he will be propounding in a few hours centers on Hamlet, and because like Hamlet he is dressed in black. Some of his recollections from this play seem to help Stephen think about his calling as an artist.",
    "expandedNote": " Mocking his pretentiousness as a young writer, he remembers his ambition to have his short \"epiphanies\" lodged in \"all the great libraries of the world,\" where readers in the far distant future would look back in awe at the great Irish genius of the early 20th century. Even though the epiphanies make no rational sense, they will seem so \"deeply deep\" that readers will puzzle over their profound meanings. Into this evocation of the younger Stephen's self-adoration breaks the voice of a somewhat older and wiser Stephen, quoting Polonius: \"Ay, very like a whale.\"\n In 3.2 Hamlet toys with the overly compliant Polonius, recognizing that, like Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, he is trying to get information out of the prince by humoring him in his every mad fancy. Hamlet points to a cloud in the sky \"that's almost in the shape of a camel,\" and Polonius readily agrees that it's camel-like. He changes his mind, deciding that it's weasel-shaped, and Polonius agrees again. \"Or like a whale,\" Hamlet says, and Polonius agrees, \"Very like a whale\" (3.2.376-82). In an aside, Hamlet exclaims, \"They fool me to the top of my bent\" (3.2.384). Future readers of Stephen's epiphanies will be doing the same thing, making fools of themselves in the course of humoring the artist's pretense that deep meanings can be discerned in his works. \n Elsewhere in Proteus, Stephen compares himself walking in black clothes along the Sandymount shore to both the young prince walking on the battlements of Elsinore to encounter his father's ghost, and the ghost itself. He is the prince when he closes his eyes at the beginning of the chapter and thinks, \"If I fell over a cliff that beetles o'er his base,\" echoing Horatio's warning in 1.4 that the ghost may tempt Hamlet \"to the dreadful summit of the cliff / That beetles o'er his base into the sea.\" Later he is the ghost: \"So in the moon's midwatches I pace the path above the rocks, in sable silvered, hearing Elsinore's tempting flood.\" Horatio uses the phrase \"sable silvered\" in 1.2 to describe the ghost's beard when Hamlet asks him for identifying information. In Scylla and Charybdis Stephen will argue that the great playwright wrote Hamlet from the perspective of the ghost, not from that of the young prince, so this detail implies an aspiration to grow into artistic fatherhood. \n Two scenes later, Hamlet and Horatio appear on the castle's guard-platform on a cold night—in \"a nipping and an eager air\" (1.4.2). The Ghost appears again and Hamlet resolves to follow where it leads, making Horatio fear that it may \"tempt you toward the flood, my lord,\" either leading the young prince to fall off a cliff into the sea or assuming some terrifying shape that would drive him mad (1.4.69-78). Like prince Hamlet, Stephen encounters \"nipping and eager airs\" on the beach, and he is willing to brave the \"tempting flood,\" skirting the element of water that so terrifies him in order to play, Proteus-like, with the shifting shapes that the sea evokes in his mind. \n When Stephen hunts about for some paper to record his fragment of a poem, he thinks, \" My tablets,\" echoing the prince after he speaks with the ghost: \"My tables—meet it is I set it down / That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain\" (1.5.107-8). The reference is to small tablet books that Elizabethans carried about with them to record their thoughts when they were on the move and could not use a quill pen. Made of wax-coated vellum or cardboard, they could be inscribed with a metal stylus and then erased with a sponge."

    "note": " New Style. \"Universally that person's acumen is esteemed very little perceptive...ever irrevocably enjoined\": the first real prose in Oxen of the Sun, after the ritualistic triune chants, has a monstrously longwinded, indirect, and obscure style. If one makes the effort to wrest some sense from these two torturous sentences (and there is enjoyable mental exercise to be had in doing so), their gist seems fairly simple: God wants human beings to procreate, an imperative that Ireland has long honored, but now some un-\"perceptive\" people have forgotten their heritage. Though the message is uncomplicated, getting at it through the strange vocabulary and syntax is like crawling through a patch of thorn bushes. Joyce suggested that this paragraph, the first of a succession of prose stylings designed to mimic the development of English prose, was inspired by Latin writings that predated the development of English.",
    "expandedNote": " In a letter to his friend Frank Budgen on 20 March 1920, Joyce reported that he was \"working hard at Oxen of the Sun, the idea being the crime committed against fecundity by sterilizing the act of coition.\" The chapter, he wrote, would parallel the stages of human embryonic development and \"the periods of faunal evolution in general\" by presenting an historically arranged sequence of English prose styles, \"introduced by a Sallustian-Tacitean prelude (the unfertilized ovum).\" The paragraph discussed here appears to constitute the prelude he was talking about, though possibly the succeeding two paragraphs should be included, since they too are Latinate and highly obscure.\n Sallust (86-ca. 35 BCE) and Tacitus (ca. 56-ca. 120 AD) were Roman historians. Why Joyce should have looked to these ancient, non-English writers as he began recapitulating the historical development of English prose is a mystery, though Tacitus did write extensively about the Germanic peoples who later settled in Britain, and some people think he may have been a Celt. Nor is it at all clear (to this poor Latinist, at least) how the prose of the two historians could have inspired Joyce to compose the magnificently involuted gobbledygook of his first paragraph. Tacitus wrote clearly and sparely. Even when his sentences are lengthened by subordinate clauses and parallel verbs, his aim is always to describe a situation as economically and directly as possible. Sallust was known for unusual diction (obsolete or rarely used words, innovative phrasings, nonstandard spellings, strange conjunctions and verb endings, neologisms), but he too preferred brevity to Ciceronian ornateness. \n Gifford supposes that the paragraph is an \"imitation\" of Sallust and Tacitus, which seems hard to fathom, though he qualifies the claim by affirming Stuart Gilbert's observation that the prose sounds like a literal translation from Latin, \"without Anglicization of word usage and syntax.\" That much seems plausible. The long sentences, with their disjointed clauses, looping parenthetical phrases, and bafflingly arranged modifiers, do feel like a poor translator's effort to adapt the syntax of Latin to an uninflected language. To take one small example, \"the honourable by ancestors transmitted customs\" places words in an order that Latin case declensions can accommodate but that wreaks havoc with English syntax.\n The passage's use of obscure Latinate words where others would better convey meaning to an English-speaker—acumen, sapience, proliferent, benefaction, exhortator, and so on—likewise suggests an effort to approximate the effect of reading some kind of Latin. Several totally unfamiliar Latinate words may even suggest neologism and archaism in the manner of Sallust: \"omnipollent\" means \"all-powerful\" (pollens, from polleo, \"I am strong\"), and \"lutulent\" means \"muddy, turbid, thick\" (lutulentus, from lutum, \"mud\"). Gifford identifies \"irrevecund\" as a rare word meaning \"immodest.\" \n The paragraph's core assertions, wrapped within webs of misdirection that Joyce evidently labored hard to weave, seem to be somewhat as follows: In \"no exterior splendour\" (no outward manifestation?) is the \"prosperity of a nation more efficaciously asserted\" (economic wellbeing should result in population increase? improvement in citizens' lives?) than in its ways of showing \"solicitude\" (care) for the condition of pregnancy, which is \"omnipollent nature's incorrupted benefaction.\" The \"evangel\" (good tidings) of God's holy book gives us both \"command and promise\" to be fruitful and multiply, and so the \"reiteratedly procreating function\" (making babies not just once, but repeatedly) is \"ever irrevocably enjoined\" upon us. In the past, our \"nation excellently commenced\" a tradition of respecting this imperative (by having large families? by honoring pregnant women?), and it is to be hoped that these \"honourable by ancestors transmitted customs\" (excellent traditions handed down from our ancestors) will be perpetuated in the future. But some people today have an \"acumen\" (intellectual keenness) that is not very \"perceptive.\" Lacking in \"sapience\" (wise understanding) of what, rightly understood, requires \"veneration,\" these \"inilluminated\" ones do not see that every good citizen must join in the cultural project, becoming \"the exhortator and admonisher\" of his fellow citizens (urging them to carry on the old wholesome traditions, and reproving those who do not).\n In the immortal words of Monty Python, \"Every sperm is sacred, / Every sperm is great. / When a sperm is wasted, / God gets quite irate.\" The theme of divine anger at the taking of life, prompted by Homer's story of Odysseus' men killing the cattle of Helios, starts here and continues throughout Oxen of the Sun. The relevance of this message to the drama acted out in the maternity hospital—where drunken and blasphemous young atheists raucously celebrate sex while a poor woman suffers through an excruciatingly prolonged labor—is quite clear. The connection to Sallust and Tacitus, however, feels extremely tenuous. Could Joyce, as he continued working on Oxen, possibly have found some medieval Latin text better suited to his purposes than the Roman historians? Such a text, if one were found, might conceivably account not only for the ungainly prose but also for the Christian messaging.\n My notes will attempt to comprehensively address the prose styles in Oxen, while dealing more sparingly with the notion that they can be identified with stages of pregnancy, embryonic development, or animal evolution. Joyce wrote in a letter to Harriet Shaw Weaver that the chapter contained \"nine circles of development,\" and Robert Janusko has observed that he worked in nine notebooks corresponding to the nine months of gestation. But it remains an open question whether the finished chapter creates such an effect with anything approaching the dense specificity of its echoes of English prose writers, and critics who have labored to associate styles with the stages of pregnancy seldom agree with one another on the particulars. \n Some styles do suggest phases of organic development, however, and nowhere is this more evident than at the beginning of the chapter. Joyce's notion that his Sallustian prelude would correspond to \"the unfertilized ovum\" seems as good an explanation as any for its inchoate form. The sprawling shapelessness was clearly part of his design. The long final section of Oxen rivals the first one in inchoate obscurity (though in no other way), and in the letter to Weaver Joyce called these challenging sections \"the headpiece and tailpiece of opposite chaos.\" Some critics have associated the final section with an \"afterbirth\"—the placental remains of the developmental process—or with the inarticulate cries of a newborn baby. The opening style gives the impression of prose that has the potential to be intelligible, but has not yet realized its destiny."

Dalkey was a good address in the prosperous southern suburbs. As Finerty's caption indicates, it was a site for sea bathing, grand scenic views, promenades, and band concerts.",
    "expandedNote": " Some readers, beginning with Stuart Gilbert, have heard, in this name at the beginning of a chapter on history, a reference to the 18th century historiographer Giambattista Vico, whose ideas figure prominently in Finnegans Wake. It is an intriguing possibility: Vico does seem an odd name to encounter in the context of a boys' school south of Dublin. But it is the name of an actual road, and Stephen has another reason to be thinking of it: it indicates that Armstrong's parents are \"Welloff.\" Furthermore, Joyce modeled Armstrong on a boy named Clifford Ferguson who did in fact live in Vico Terrace (Ellmann, 153). \n Joyce was certainly reading Vico by the time he composed Nestor, and he would not have used the philosopher's name without awareness that he might be sending his reader off in search of literary echoes. The question, though, is whether he built Viconian ideas into Ulysses. There are no other details in Nestor that might reasonably be regarded as allusions to Vico. \n However, Ellmann does note a possible echo in Scylla and Charybdis. He quotes a passage from Benedetto Croce's description of Vico's ideas in his Aesthetic (1902): \"Man creates the human world, creates it by transforming himself into the facts of society: by thinking it he re-creates his own creations, traverses over again the paths he has already traversed, reconstructs the whole ideally, and thus knows it with full and true knowledge\" (Ellmann, 340n). As Ellmann recognizes, this sentence shows a striking resemblance to the theory of peripatetic solipsism that Stephen advances in the library."

    "note": " In Telemachus Mulligan dons \"his primrose waistcoat,\" and in Proteus Stephen thinks of his companion metonymically as a \"primrose doublet.\" The color of the vest, a light yellow, coheres with Mulligan's sartorial choice of a dressinggown, and it may symbolically reinforce Stephen's judgment of him as a \"heretic\" who would deny the serious value of Stephen's art.",
    "expandedNote": " What Americans call the \"vest\" in a three-piece suit, Britons typically call a “waistcoat.” Edwardian gentlemen wore waistcoats with five or more buttons that closed high up on the chest, the fabric either matching that of the coat or contrasting with it. The color of Mulligan’s garment marks him as a bit of a dandy, and as someone who is comfortable with elegant British customs: pale yellow waistcoats have been fashionable in England since the eighteenth century. Stephen's term \"doublet\" reflects his interest in the earlier Elizabethan period, when gentlemen wore short, tight-fitting padded jackets, either with or without sleeves.\n Much as Stephen thinks of Buck as a doublet, the narrative often tracks his progress through the day in terms of the appearances of this colorful vest. Mulligan shows up in Scylla and Charybdis thus: \"Primrosevested he greeted gaily with his doffed Panama as with a bauble.\" Dining with Haines in the D.B.C. in Wandering Rocks, \"Buck Mulligan's primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter.\" In Oxen of the Sun he is \"the young blood in the primrose vest,\" and later in that chapter \"the figure of Bannon in explorer's kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide brogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred manners of Malachi Roland St John Mulligan.\" The gay clothes of the Buck, then, define him just as sharply as the somber clothes of Stephen and Bloom define them."

    "note": " Jews may aptly be called \"wanderers on the earth,\" as Deasy does (Bloom too thinks that they have \"Wandered far away over all the earth\"), because for three thousand years their history as a people has been defined by expulsion, exile, and yearning for a homeland. Deasy is also thinking of the legendary figure of the \"wandering jew\" who, because he \"sinned against the light\" (by taunting Christ on the way to the crucifixion, or striking him, or denying his divinity), was condemned by God to wander the earth until the second coming of Christ at the end of time. This mythical figure was sometimes identified as man named Ahasuerus, a bit of lore that shows up in the Citizen's mouth when he reviles Bloom inCyclops: \"Ahasuerus I call him. Cursed by God.\"",
    "expandedNote": " In Calypso Bloom accurately thinks of his people living from \"captivity to captivity.\" Jewish national identity begins in Exodus with the twelve tribes of Israel living as slaves in Egypt in the second millennium BCE and being delivered from their bondage by Moses, who leads them back to their ancestral homeland. The second part of Kings records another captivity, when the Assyrian empire in the 8th century BCE conquered the northern kingdom of Israel and resettled some thousands of Samarians, who became known as the Ten Lost Tribes, in northern Mesopotamia.\n A still more culturally resonant exile, addressed in many books of the Hebrew Bible, occurred in the 6th century BCE when the Babylonians of southern Mesopotamia grew in power, conquered Jerusalem, destroyed the First Temple, and deported many thousands of Judeans to Babylon. When the Persians ruler Cyrus the Great defeated the Babylonians, he allowed the Hebrews to return to the land of Israel and build the Second Temple in Jerusalem. But in the first century AD, the Romans again destroyed the temple and again drove the Jews out of their homeland. \n These disastrous encounters with the Egyptian, Assyrian, Babylonian, and Roman empires were followed by the long European diaspora with its history of racial discriminations, persecutions, massacres, and explusions, including Spain's exile of all its remaining unconverted Jews at the end of the 15th century. Most of these Spanish Jews went to north Africa, where they did not encounter markedly better treatment. In Cyclops Bloom complains that Jews are \"At this very moment . . . sold by auction in Morocco like slaves or cattle.\" Gifford says of this that \"Jews were not technically slaves in Morocco in 1904, but the Moslem majority did subject them to 'compulsory service'; both men and women were compelled to do all servile tasks, even on the Sabbath and holy days, and these services could apparently be bought and sold in the Moslem community.\" \n The legend of the Wandering Jew goes far back in medieval history and even has antecedents in late antiquity, when certain Christian writers described the diasporic Jews as \"a new Cain,\" condemned to be \"fugitives and wanderers upon the earth\" as a result of their criminal betrayal of Christ. This history is well detailed in Salo Wittmayer Baron's A Social and Religious History of the Jews: Citizen or Alien Conjurer (Columbia UP, 1967). By the 13th century, stories of an immortal Jew who had spoken to Jesus were widespread in Europe, and from the 14th century to the present day this figure has appeared in many different works of literature.\n Mulligan mockingly calls Bloom \"The wandering jew\" in Scylla and Charybdis, explicitly introducing this analogue into Joyce's story about a peripatetic Jewish protagonist, and the Citizen's execration of Ahasuerus makes clear the religious condemnation implicit in the figure. Circetoo plays on the anti-Semitic resonances, linking Bloom with the far less acceptably Jewish Reuben J. Dodd: \"Reuben J Antichrist, wandering jew, a clutching hand open on his spine, stumps forward. Across his loins is slung a pilgrim's wallet from which protrude promissory notes and dishonoured bills.\" But Oxen of the Sun uses kinder language to present the same mythical figure: \"Of Israel's folk was that man that on earth wandering far had fared.\" \n Moses too was a wandering Jew, and his frequent association with Bloom joins in the recuperative work of bringing positive qualities to this mythic figure. In Aeolus Moses appears as a Jewish leader whose rousing call to national identity symbolically figures Ireland's own longing for the restoration of its homeland. Joined with the nostos theme of Homer's Odyssey, Moses gives homelessness a good name. \n The verb \"wander\" recurs incessantly in this novel. On Christian lips it is charged with moral opprobrium, attached to souls who lack a spiritual center in God: \"by the power of God thrust Satan down to hell and with him those other wickedspirits who wander through the world for the ruin of souls\" (Hades); \"And careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erred and wandered, their eyes wet with contrition\" (Nausicaa); \"for him too a word of pardoneven though he had erred and sinned and wandered\" (Nausicaa); \"Thrust syphilis down to hell and with him those other licensed spirits. Time, gents! Who wander through the world\" (Oxen of the Sun). But when it enters the orbit of Bloom, \"that vigilant wanderer\" (Oxen of the Sun), and Stephen, \"wandering Ængus of the birds,\" the word gathers positive associations from minds devoted to exploring the varieties of experience."

    "note": " \"O Jesus wait yes that thing has come on me yes now wouldnt that afflict you\": near the end of her 6th sentence, Molly realizes that her period has started (pun intended), and for well more than a page her thoughts center on menstruation. At the end of the sentence, as she sits on the chamber pot listening to it \"pouring out of me like the sea,\" she inexactly remembers the beginning of a poem by Robert Southey: \"O how the waters come down at Lahore.\" Together with an expression just a little earlier, \"O Jamesy,\" the allusion involves meta-fictive self-reference on Joyce's part.",
    "expandedNote": " Lahore is in the Punjab, in present-day Pakistan, but the poem describes the Lodore Falls in England's Lake District, across the sea from Belfast. Southey, England's Poet Laureate from 1813 until his death in 1843, wrote some notable works for children, including The Story of the Three Bears about an ill-mannered \"little old Woman,\" later known as Goldilocks. In \"The Cataract of Lodore: Described in Rhymes for the Nursery,\" Southey responds to a request of his young son, seconded by his two daughters: \"'How does the water / Come down at Lodore?' . . . And moreover he tasked me / To tell him in rhyme.\"\n \"Lodore\" begs comparison with other 19th century lyric soundscapes. Instead of the relentless onomatopoeia of Edgar Allen Poe's \"The Bells,\" or the intricate alliteration and assonance of Gerard Manley Hopkins' \"Inversnaid,\" Southey's poem relies mostly on his son's request, \"rhyme,\" to imitate the clangorous effects of its subject. The poem ends with several long verse paragraphs in which the end-rhymes give way to internal rhymes—first in twos, then threes, and finally fours:\n Collecting, projecting,\n Receding and speeding,\n And shocking and rocking,\n And darting and parting . . . \n Dividing and gliding and sliding,\n And falling and brawling and sprawling,\n And driving and riving and striving,\n And sprinkling and twinkling and wrinkling . . . \n Retreating and beating and meeting and sheeting,\n Delaying and straying and playing and spraying,\n Advancing and prancing and glancing and dancing,\n Recoiling, turmoiling and toiling and boiling . . . \n One can easily imagine the delight which Southey's children took in hearing their father meet their request to imitate the effects of the waterfall in rhyme. Less immediately apparent is the delight which Joyce must have taken in having the heroine ofUlysses associate the sounds of her chamber pot with the musical effects of a lyric poem. In doing so, he alluded to the pun embedded in the title of his first book of poems, Chamber Music—a pun which has already occurred to Molly's husband in Sirens.\n This interplay between character and author supports the inference that Gifford makes about another of Molly's remarks just a few lines earlier. Sitting on her bloody chamber-pot, she thinks, \"O Jamesy let me up out of this pooh,\" to which Gifford asks, \"Dodging the curse O Jesus? or calling on her maker?\" Probably both readings are correct. Molly felt no need to dodge the curse at the moment when she first recognized the onset of her period—\"O Jesus wait yes that thing has come on me\"—but she may well be falling back on an accustomed substitute here. \n For Joyce, however, her exclamation is like Alfred Hitchcock strolling through a scene in one of his movies, or Renaissance artists featuring their own faces in their paintings. The artist who, according to Stephen in A Portrait, \"like the God of the creation, remains within or behind or beyond or above his handiwork, invisible, refined out of existence,\" shows his face here, in close proximity to a veiled reference to the poems of Chamber Music. In a 21 August 1909 letter Jim told Nora that \"When I wrote them, I was a strange lonely boy, walking about myself at night and thinking that some day a girl would love me\" (Letters II, 236-37 andSelected Letters 161). In 1922, near the end of his big novel, he allowed his female protagonist to respond. She seems to be saying, You were right to make your pun on water music, but if you're the god of this fictive world why on earth did you give us menstruation?"

    "note": " In 1908, while living in Trieste, Joyce wrote this sentence in a notebook: \"She came to me silently in a dream after her death and her wasted body within its loose brown habit gave out a faint odour of wax and rosewood and her breath a faint odour of wetted ashes.\" Telemachus reworks the sentence not once but twice, making very slight changes each time, and Stephen is still thinking of it in Nestor and Proteus.",
    "expandedNote": " Joyce juggles the words of the first clause, changing it to \"Silently, in a dream she had come to him,\" and then to \"In a dream, silently, she had come to him.\" Both later versions alter \"habit\" to \"graveclothes.\" In the second revision, the graveclothes are no longer \"brown.\" Both revisions decide that the \"odour\" of the wasted body (unlike that of his mother’s breath) is not \"faint.\" Instead of giving \"out\" an odour, they give it \"off.\" Instead of introducing \"her breath\" with \"and,\" they do so with a comma. The one significant change comes when the first passage inserts a subordinate clause between \"her breath\" and its \"faint odour of wetted ashes.\" It is a breath \"that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful.\" The second passage decides that, no, the breath \"bent over him with mute secret words.\" \n This searching for an ideal shape within a mass of words strongly characterizes Stephen’s calling as a poet, and it was also typical of Joyce’s practice as a prose stylist—both in the revisions that preceded his published texts, and also, as the double revision in Telemachus suggests, within those texts, which tend to revisit and rephrase things already said."

  "010120weavewind": {
    "note": " Stephen's thought in Telemachus about heretic mockers, \"The void awaits surely all them that weave the wind,\" itself weaves an unsatisfying web of intertextual echoes. Gifford cites similar but not identical sayings in Isaiah and John Webster’s The Devil’s Law Case, together asserting human impotence against the power of God or mortality.",
    "expandedNote": " In Nestor, Stephen seems to apply the phrase to himself. After pursuing some abstruse and ultimately frustrating Aristotelian speculations, he thinks, \"Weave, weaver of the wind.\" Commenting on this passage, Thornton notes a similarity to language in Blake's Jerusalem, but confesses, \"I feel however that there is some other more specific source for the weaving allusions which I have not found.\" Gifford notes that \"In ancient Irish tradition weaving is connected with the art of prophecy\"—a connection which hardly seems relevant either to Stephen's dismal, claustrophic thoughts about history or to his futile efforts to make theoretical sense of it. In still another part of Nestor, he thinks of Jesus' dark sayings being \"woven and woven on the church's looms.\" Here too, the image seems to imply failure to grasp the truth. \n An analogue more suited to Stephen's thoughts in both chapters can be found in T. S. Eliot’s Gerontion, whose speaker says, “Vacant shuttles / Weave the wind.” If there was borrowing, however, it seems more likely to have been practiced by Eliot, who was reading Ulysses in the years leading up to its publication, and who once wrote, \"Bad poets borrow. Good poets steal.\" (Eliot began working on Gerontion in 1917, two years after Joyce substantially completed Telemachus, and he did not publish the poem until 1920. Joyce wrote out a fair copy manuscript of Telemachus in 1917, and it was printed in the Little Review in 1918.)"

It then turns west on the Ringsend Road and crosses first the River Dodder and then \"The grand canal\" on its way to Great Brunswick (now Pearse) Street, a major thoroughfare on the south side of central Dublin. This path takes it to the Carlisle (O'Connell) Bridge over the Liffey.",
    "expandedNote": " The narrative takes note of sights at various points along this path. Passing \"Watery Lane\" (now Dermot O'Hurley Avenue), off the Irishtown Road in Ringsend, Bloom spots Stephen Dedalus walking toward town from his jaunt on the tide flats: \"Mr Bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man, clad in mourning, a wide hat.\" As the carriages roll along \"Ringsend road,\" they pass \" Wallace Bros the bottleworks\" and then \"Dodder bridge\" as they cross the River Dodder, which flows north from the Wicklow Hills and empties into the Liffey just east of the Grand Canal. On the journey up Brunswick Street Bloom passes some of the same locales he traversed on foot in Lotus Eaters, including \"The hazard.\" He thinks, \"Only two there now. Nodding. Full as a tick. Too much bone in their skulls. The other trotting round with a fare. An hour ago I was passing there.\"\n As the cortège approaches the Grand Canal, Jack Power asks for the whereabouts of Corny Kelleher, the undertaker who has organized the procession.

Recalling words from a recently published sonnet—\"Whelps and dams of murderous foes whom none / But we had spared...\"—he refers with withering irony to \"the concentration camp sung by Mr Swinburne.\" His contempt for the poem's defense of British atrocities in South Africa reflects opinions expressed publicly in England and America as well as Ireland.",
    "expandedNote": "Swinburne wrote his poem in response to the death of a fellow Northumberland native, Lieutenant Colonel George Elliott Benson. Benson led a \"flying column\" of 2,000 British troops that had been clearing Boer settlements during the day and effectively attacking Boer commandos at night. On 30 October 1901 General Botha's forces surrounded the unit's rear guard of 200 men while it was marching back to base and annihilated it. Colonel Benson died of his wounds the next morning. On November 9, the Saturday Review published Swinburne's sonnet \"On the Death of Colonel Benson,\" later included in Swinburne's final volume of poetry, A Channel Passage and Other Poems (1904):\nNorthumberland, so proud and sad to-day, \n Weep and rejoice, our mother, whom no son \n More glorious than this dead and deathless one \n Brought ever fame whereon no time shall prey. \n Nor heed we more than he what liars dare say \n Of mercy's holiest duties left undone \n Toward whelps and dams of murderous foes, whom none \n Save we had spared or feared to starve and slay.\n Alone as Milton and as Wordsworth found \n And hailed their England, when from all around \n Howled all the recreant hate of envious knaves, \n Sublime she stands: while, stifled in the sound, \n Each lie that falls from German boors and slaves \n Falls but as filth dropt in the wandering waves. \n Swinburne's jingoistic hatred for people defending their homeland is fairly standard fare in times of war, but his dehumanizing characterization of Boer women and children as \"Whelps and dams\" sets a high bar of moral hideousness that he quickly tops by congratulating the British for confining these mongrels in camps where starvation and disease could kill them, rather than simply butchering them as a less advanced people would have done.\n Thornton notes that the November 16 issue of the Saturday Review, the next week, featured letters by Duncan C. McVarish and Stephen Gwynn deploring Swinburne's justification of the camps, along with a reply by the poet. Gifford elaborates: \"Swinburne's poem was regarded as a whitewash of the concentration camps . . . One letterwriter called him 'unthinking' and 'excessive'; the other remarked: 'It is not necessary to call the women and children 'whelps and dams'.\" Swinburne \"replied by citing a series of atrocity stories about the Boers, whom he described as 'virtual slave drivers'.\""

  "040010myhat": {
    "note": " On his way to the outhouse, Bloom notices a void in his memory: \"Where is my hat, by the way? Must have put it back on the peg. Or hanging up on the floor. Funny, I don't remember that. Hallstand too full. Four umbrellas, her raincloak. Picking up the letters. Drago's shopbell ringing.\" Acknowledging these discontinuities in consciousness is one aspect of the realism of Joyce's prose style, and in this case it probably registers the shock that Bloom received upon seeing Boylan's letter.",
    "expandedNote": " The narrative has represented his return to 7 Eccles Street: \"Two letters and a card lay on the hallfloor. He stooped and gathered them. Mrs Marion Bloom. His quickened heart slowed at once. Bold hand. Mrs Marion.\" It has also showed his return to the bedroom, upstairs: \"Entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm yellow twilight towards her tousled head.\" The time between, however, is a blank. \n In \"The Rhetoric of Silence,\" JJQ 14.4 (Summer 1977): 382-94, Hugh Kenner observes that \"Novelists normally don't know where characters' hats are. The heady experience of frequenting a novelist who does know may encourage us to turn back, expecting to find out more about Bloom than Bloom knows himself.\" In this case, Kenner notes that Bloom has been gripped, in the street, by a vivid apprehension of old age and death, and when he emerges from it he wants only \"to smell the gentle smoke of tea, fume of the pan, sizzling butter. Be near her ample bedwarmed flesh. Yes, yes.\" But when he enters the front door, his attention is arrested by another \"unpleasant jolt,\" from seeing Boylan's letter. \"Not only is 'Mrs Marion' a way of affirming that there is no Mr. Leopold worth considering, the 'bold hand' is recognizably Boylan's, and we are having our first experience with the principle that any irruption of Boylan into Bloom's field of attention has the effect of suspending his faculties. That is why he is not aware of what he did with his hat\" (384).\n The gap in the narrative, then, corresponds to a blankness in Bloom's mind that is best conveyed by silence. Bloom's remark on his mental lapse—\"Funny I don't remember that\"—points both to an interesting feature of human psychology and to the \"rhetoric of silence\" by which Joyce's prose style evokes that psychology."

  "170016wherewasmoses": {
    "note": " Of the three \"enigmas\" that Bloom ponders as he prepares to enter the marital bedroom, the last, which he has brooded on for \"30 years,\" sounds nonsensical: \"Where was Moses when the candle went out?\" And it is nonsensical: this riddle, apparently commonplace in Joyce's day, had nothing to do with the great Hebrew leader and it set the listener up for various jokey answers. Ithaca heightens the sense of absurdity by implying that Bloom, \"having effected natural obscurity by the extinction of artificial light\" (i.e., turning off the lamp), suddenly finds an answer which should not have required so long to become \"selfevident\": Moses was in the dark. But lurking beneath the childish silliness of this minor mystery are some sexual resonances that may be relevant to Bloom's current situation.",
    "expandedNote": " Like the tongue-twister featured in Singin' in the Rain (\"Moses supposes his toeses are roses, but Moses supposes erroneously\"), some answers to the riddle were simply silly. In Weep Some More, by musicologist Sigmund Spaeth, Thornton found two of these nonsense answers in different versions of Where Was Moses When the Light Went Out?, a popular song which dated back at least as far as 1878, 26 years before Bloom's revelation. According to one version, Moses was \"Down the cellar, eating sauerkraut.\" The other \"implied that Moses had suffered the inferior extremity of his shirt to escape from its confinement\"—i.e., he was \"Down in the cellar with his shirt tail out.\" \n Given Bloom's fondness for songs, ad jingles, and nursery-style rhymes, his head may well have become infected with such catchy pop-culture nonsense. But locating a couple of these rhymes as Thornton does—and Gifford and Slote follow his lead—sheds no light whatsoever on the Ithaca passage. The relevant idea, implied by both verses putting Moses in the cellar, is that he was in the dark. This straightforward answer to the riddle is not nonsensical, but it is mildly absurd: it embodies the \"Duh!\" (or Homeric \"D'oh!\") principle of realizing the obvious. \n In a personal communication, Doug Pope observes that Joyce might have known of a literary precedent for Bloom's answer: the same solution is mentioned in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, first published in the UK in 1884. In chapter 17, when Huck appears at the front door of a family's cabin in the dead of night, they cautiously take him in, ascertain that he is not a member of the murderous Shepherdson clan with whom they are feuding, and entrust him to the keeping of their son Buck, who \"looked about as old as me—thirteen or fourteen or along there.\" Buck takes Huck upstairs to his room, gives him some clothes, brags about some small creatures he caught in the woods yesterday, \"and he asked me where Moses was when the candle went out.\" Huck is flummoxed by the riddle, though his presence in a candle-lit cabin in the woods might well have suggested an answer, and Buck encourages him: “But you can guess, can’t you?” Finally, Buck supplies the answer himself: “Why, he was in the dark! That’s where he was!”\n Riddles like this, stock in trade for 13-year-old boys, deliver a stupidly literal answer that seems head-slappingly obvious only in retrospect. Bloom is much older, and he has discovered the answer himself, but since his Eureka! moment comes only after 30 years of on-again, off-again pondering, he appears to no better advantage than the uncharacteristically slow-witted Huck. Joyce's allusion to the American novel, if such it is (and \"candle\" is convincingly specific!), shows him playfully making Bloom the victim of a joke.\n But in some other variants of Where Was Moses When the Light Went Out?, the same implied answer, \"in the dark,\" assumed more suggestive meanings. Instead of asking a boy to solve a riddle, the version whose lyrics are reproduced at the top of this note exploited his terrors and excited his early adolescent desires. In this song Moses is the singer's \"christian name,\" and he recalls how a \"nurse girl\" who puts him to bed at night used to terrify him by narrating stories \"of ghosts and goblins in a very awful way,\" then putting out the light and asking him where Moses was when the light went out. The poor boy would lie awake for hours after this sadistic manipulation. Eventually, though, he gets his own back: the nurse is fired, and after hearing that she has married a man named Moses Muggins he finds her in the street two days after the wedding and \"innocently\" asks her where Moses was when the light went out. \n His sly revenge births further sexual innuendo 20 years later when a train on which he is riding enters a pitch-black tunnel, prompting a young woman sitting near him to ask where Moses was when the light went out. The song does not say whether she asks this question knowing what trains entering dark tunnels could symbolize, but its description of her as \"lively\" suggests that she does. As for the young man, hearing the Moses riddle again revives his cherished sadomasochistic memory of the servant girl. As they emerge from the tunnel he says to this new woman, \"As you've waken'd up old memories you're the girl I'd like to wed.\" Singing the song years in the future, he says that he did marry the girl and they have produced six fine sons, who, when their father puts out the light at bedtime, sing, Where was Moses when the light went out?\n If Joyce wanted his readers to call to mind some such version of the Victorian-era song, then Bloom's imagination of a Jew (his favorite Jew) finding himself in the dark brings with it an air of dread spiked with sexual excitement. These emotions are by no means irrelevant to Bloom's situation as he stands in his parlor, getting up the nerve to crawl into bed with the woman who has deliberately subjected him to sexual humiliation on June 16. Is he a candle whose wick has been snuffed? Or is he being called to plunge back into the dark tunnel? Penelope will show that Molly is thinking both thoughts, and looking for Bloom to decide which version of the story will come to pass.\n Both the parlor song and Twain's story feature a young man placed in a position of awkward ignorance and challenged to find his way out. It is possible to hold both in mind while reading the Q & A in Ithaca. Like Huck, Bloom has set himself the task of solving a riddle, and the answer is revealed by his present situation: he has just turned out the light. But the blackness in which he is standing also evokes perils, as it does for the terrified boy in the song. Alarmed by the possibility that his marriage may be coming to an end, and keenly aware of his sexual connection to Molly, Bloom inherits both the boy-man's fears and his glimpses of sexual maturity. The allusion suggests that he may yet triumph over his ghosts and goblins by acting the part of a man. A silly song suggests the possibility of something heroic in him: overcoming sexual self-doubt."

  "050044whisperinggallery": {
    "note": " Imagining a woman confessing her sins to a priest, Bloom explores a bizarre fancy that their low whispers might be overheard because of a hidden feature of the confession box: \"And I schschschschschsch. And did you chachachachacha? And why did you? Look down at her ring to find an excuse. Whispering gallery walls have ears. Husband learn to his surprise. God's little joke.\" Whispering galleries are curved structures which transmit sound waves unusually well, allowing a person to hear the whispered words of another person at a position far removed.",
    "expandedNote": " Some natural caves produce this effect, and some science museums demonstrate it with pairs of concave parabolic dishes that face one another across an empty space: standing at one focus of the resulting long ellipse, a person whispers into the nearby dish and the sounds are heard at the corresponding focal point facing the distant dish. But Bloom has probably heard of whispers carried in circular or hemispherical rooms, most particularly the famous whispering gallery in the dome of St. Paul's Cathedral in London. Gifford notes that \"a low whisper near one wall can be distinctly heard at the opposite wall 108 feet away.\" \n Starting in the 1870s, the distinguished British physicist John William Strutt, Baron Rayleigh, studied this remarkable effect in St. Paul's and discovered whispering-gallery waves: sound waves that propagate by clinging to the circular walls, rather than traveling across the intervening space. In the first two decades of the 20th century Lord Rayleigh developed sophisticated wave theories to account for the phenomenon. The sound waves, it appears, travel around the circumference of the gallery via air particles that move in elliptical trajectories. \n All of this is doubtless far beyond Leopold Bloom's ken, but it seems possible, given his scientific curiosity, that he has heard of Lord Rayleigh's discoveries. The strange phenomenon of sound waves clinging to walls—illustrated here by a digital map of sound waves traveling around a cylinder of air equivalent in diameter to the cupola of St. Paul's—does uncannily echo Bloom's fanciful conceit that \"Whispering gallery walls have ears.\""

  "040015whitebutton": {
    "note": " Calypso wastes no time introducing the reader to one of Leopold Bloom's more striking psychological peculiarities: his unusually strong interest in excrement and the anus. He appreciates the strong, rich flavors of internal organs but \"Most of all\" kidneys because they smack of \"faintly scented urine.\" The admirably \"Clean\" appearance of his cat does not preclude, or even conflict with, his noticing \"the white button under the butt of her tail.\" At the end of the chapter he reflects on the great usefulness of manure for fertilizing gardens and even cleaning leather gloves—\"Dirty cleans\"—before calmly contemplating his own bowel movement and urination. Each of these details might be regarded on its own as simply a realistic feature of Joyce's depiction of the ordinary contents of consciousness, but the book will slowly build a complex picture of anal eroticism and its attendant psychological dispositions in Bloom.",
    "expandedNote": " One very plausibly related such disposition is Bloom's prudence with money. The novel connects this behavior with forms of cultural conditioning like ethnicity, religion, and family values, but it also suggests that psychosexual development may play a role. Late in Calypso, as Bloom prepares to take his seat in the outhouse, he thinks of lines from a nursery rhyme that run, \"The king was in his counting-house, / Counting out his money.\" The implied association with defecation is supported by an article that Sigmund Freud published in 1908, \"Character and Anal Eroticism.\" \n In Lestrygonians Bloom contemplates the ideal proportions of Greek statues of goddesses, and the fact that these females subsist on \"nectar . . . all ambrosial.\" Such thoughts lead him inevitably to the anus: \"Lovely forms of woman sculped Junonian. Immortal lovely. And we stuffing food in one hole and out behind: food, chyle, blood, dung, earth, food: have to feed it like stoking an engine. They have no. Never looked. I'll look today. Keeper won't see. Bend down let something fall see if she.\" One of the more delicious hilarities of the novel ensues offstage as Buck Mulligan happens to pass by Bloom in the National Museum while he is bending over looking between the buttocks of a goddess. Mulligan infers that Bloom is a sodomite, warning Stephen inScylla and Charybdis to \"Get thee a breechpad\" because \"He knows you. He knows your old fellow. O, I fear me, he is Greeker than the Greeks. His pale Galilean eyes were upon her mesial groove.\" These joking suggestions, minus the imputation of homosexuality, turn quite serious inCirce and are confirmed by both Bloom and his wife in Ithaca and Penelope.\n Readers of James Joyce's letters to Nora Barnacle will know that many of Bloom's sexual proclivities reflect preferences of the author himself. In lieu of extensive quotations, one sentence from a letter of 2 December 1909 may suggest their nature: \"But, side by side and inside this spiritual love I have for you there is also a wild beast-like craving for every inch of your body, for every secret and shameful part of it, for every odour and act of it.\" In Penelope Molly remembers that Bloom, channeling Keats, has written her similar letters: \"his mad crazy letters my Precious one everything connected with your glorious Body everything underlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and of joy for ever.\""

Arguably, it brings Rudyard Kipling into Ulysses for the second time.",
    "expandedNote": " § In a personal communication, Vincent Van Wyk notes that the same phrase appears in \"Columns,\" a 1903 Kipling poem about \"mobile columns\" of \"six 'undred men\" that were deployed across the South African landscape in wearying search-and-destroy missions, hunting down Boer guerilla units after the capture of Bloemfontein and Pretoria failed to produce real victory. The poem follows the British troops as they march at all hours, look for shade in the African heat, try to decide which cart-tracks to follow, and so forth, in an unending round of tedium and terror. One of its many vivid details is a \"white-eyed Kaffir 'oo gives the alarm.\"\n The British army employed many thousands of black natives in the mobile columns and in auxiliary roles, and they used the word \"kaffir\" to refer to these men, whether Xhosa, Zulu, or from other tribes. It is thought to have come from an Arabic word, kafir, meaning an infidel, though Van Wyk suggests a possible alternative in amakhafula, meaning the rubbish of the North, which Zulus applied to tribes like the Venda, Tsonga, and Ndebele that they pursued to the borders of South Africa. \n At the time of the Boer War, the word \"kaffir\" appeared widely in print and meant simply \"black native\"—a long way off from linguistic practice in South Africa today, when the word has become charged with such violent hatred that uttering it in public can earn one a well-deserved jail sentence. Still, it had never been a neutral term, and Kipling's use suggests how readily it could acquire overtones of contempt. His image of white eyes opening wide in a very black face smacks more than a little of the way black people were presented in the minstrel shows—a point that Mary Hamer makes in her online notes to the poem. \n § The racism of these shows, which entertained white American audiences with the singing and dancing of black folk while reassuring them that their potentially threatening servants were in fact lazy, stupid, superstitious, and eternally cheerful, was probably moderated somewhat when the shows moved to European stages in the later 19th century. For audiences in the UK, parodic stylings of American blacks must have been as much an exotic curiosity as a window onto a culture's charged racial fault lines. (At least at the beginning: minstrel material maintained its popularity in Britain until very late in the 20th century, by which time London had its own sizeable black minority and everybody had plenty of reason to know better.)\n Exoticism certainly seems to have figured in the stage act which Gifford and Slote cite as a source for the Citizen's remark. \"The White-eyed Singing Kaffir\" was a highly popular music hall show performed by white Londoner George (\"G. H.\") Chirgwin who, like the American Eugene Ruhlmann (\"Eugene Stratton\"), performed in blackface. Chirgwin's acts evidently involved a good deal of solidarity between performer and audience, and no particular racial animus. A talented musician, he got his start in a family troupe that imitated the minstrel shows. His stage makeup sported a large white diamond surrounding one eye in a black face, which suggests a somewhat detached, aestheticized approach to presenting a stage Negro. \n Chirgwin attributed his inspiration to an outdoor performance at which a storm blew dust into one eye: as he dabbed furiously at the eye the audience started to laugh, because he had rubbed off his black makeup. But his father had started out as a circus clown, and the diamond shape that he later incorporated into his look strongly evokes a clown's makeup. His stage delivery too was apparently far removed from the minstrel shows' air of archly mocking inferior people: he filled the space between songs with the friendly, improvisatory chatter of a working-class bloke talking to his mates. Richard Anthony Baker's British Music Hall: An Illustrated History (2014) notes that Chirgwin spoke to the people in his audiences \"as though he were addressing a select circle of old chums\" (199-200). After retiring, he kept up the patter by opening a pub.\n § Racial stereotypes were bandied about much more casually then than now, and Chirgwin's case suggests that a \"whiteeyed kaffir\" could serve as little more than a decorative vehicle for musical entertainment. But given the rancor with which the Citizen talks about (and to) Bloom, Kipling's poem seems a more likely inspiration for his phrase, in which racial animus seems unmistakably present. Several details in Ulysses suggest that Bloom's complexion is a bit swarthy by Irish standards, and Bloom himself repeats the stereotype of the \"dirty jew\" in Lestrygonians. By tarring him with the brush of blackness, the Citizen insinuates that Jews are an inferior and threatening race. \n Such racial stigmatization from a defender of Irish purity is massively ironic, given the ugly 19th century history of British publications (and sometimes American ones as well, as in the image displayed here) depicting the native Irish as an apelike and vaguely Negroid people. The English depicted the Irish as subhuman in order to justify their brutal treatment of them, and the Citizen, rather than distinguishing himself from these hated oppressors by holding himself to a higher standard, operates in much the same way. He dehumanizes people he sees as not authentically Irish—\"coming over here to Ireland filling the country with bugs\"—in order to justify his violent xenophobia.\n The Citizen is blind to this irony, but Bloom certainly is not. When accused of not being Irish (\"— What is your nation if I may ask? says the citizen\"), he retorts that the people with whom he is racially identified have been victimized just as much as the native Irish have: \"And I belong to a race too, says Bloom, that is hated and persecuted. Also now. This very moment. This very instant. . . . Robbed, says he. Plundered. Insulted. Persecuted. Taking what belongs to us by right.\" By his logic, Irish Catholics and Irish Jews should make common cause as oppressed peoples, not oppose one another from positions of narrowly defined ethnic purity. Racial essentialism is a chimera perpetuated by powerful elites who can make kaffirs of whites and Semites as easily as blacks.\n When Kipling was awarded the Nobel prize for literature in 1907, he became the first English author to win that honor, and the honor became linked with tales of English men imposing their will on India and South Africa. If Joyce did intend an allusion to \"Columns,\" he must have done so with a wicked awareness that he was linking his novel's arch-nationalist with the writer most indelibly associated with British imperial conquest. It is by no means hard to imagine him doing this. When the Citizen starts off on a tirade vituperating the \"glorious British navy\" that \"bosses the earth\" and \"the great empire they boast about of drudges and whipped serfs,\" Bloom interrupts to ask, \"isn't discipline the same everywhere. I mean wouldn't it be the same here if you put force against force?\" Armed force is the same everywhere, and from violent nationalism to rapacious imperialism only a small change of focus is required."

    "note": " Only a few miles south and southwest of Dublin lie the Wicklow Mountains, a wild area at the center of County Wicklow that today is preserved as a 54,000-acre national park. Buck Mulligan turns toward these \"awaking mountains\" at the beginning of Telemachus, and Leopold and Molly Bloom both remember a night when a jaunting car returned them from a dinner at the \"Glencree reformatory,\" passing over the \"featherbed mountain\" that is part of the range. Other chapters refer to a municipal water reservoir that lies on the eastern side of the mountains, to the Poulaphouca waterfall on the western side, to a separate County Wicklow mountain called \"the Sugarloaf,\" and to the ruined monastery at \"Glendalough.\"",
    "expandedNote": " The northernmost Wicklow Mountains—sometimes called the Dublin Mountains or Dublin Hills—are visible from the top of the Martello tower on which Mulligan and Stephen Dedalus stand at the beginning of Telemachus. In a phenomenon familiar to anyone who lives near mountains or tall buildings, morning sunlight hits the tops of these hills before any of the surrounding countryside, so they seem to be \"awaking\" first.\n The Blooms attended a fund-raising dinner at St. Kevin's Reformatory, a Catholic male reform school located about ten miles away in \"Glencree,\" the second closest valley to Dublin on the east side of the mountain range. (\"Glen\" means \"valley\"; the nearest is called Glencullen.) The top of this valley is accessed by the Old Military Road, now the R115, that the British built in the first decade of the 19th century, north-south down the length of the range, to flush out United Irishmen rebels who were hiding in the hills. A barracks was built there in 1806 but closed down in 1815, and in 1858 the buildings were repurposed as a reform school. (The repurposing has continued. The Reformatory closed in 1940, and in 1975 the Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation opened, to promote understanding between Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland during the time of the Troubles.)\n After the dinner, in darkness, a car brought the Blooms back to Dublin from the Glencree reformatory over the nearby region that Dubliners called \"the featherbed mountain,\" which is not so much a mountain as a high open plain. It may have gained its nickname because the cut-up blanket bogs on the high moorlands which the military road runs through give the land a ruffled appearance. Rolling across this wild, dark landscape Bloom pointed out various heavenly bodies to the other three people on the car while Lenehan fantasized about the heavenly body of Mrs. Bloom. \n In Lestrygonians and Penelope the Blooms recall a picnic at \"the Sugarloaf.\" These passages, and another in Cyclops, refer to one of two Sugar Loaf mountains—most likely the \"Great\" or \"Big\" one—in the eastern part of County Wicklow, very near Bray. They are even more easily accessible from Dublin. Not part of the national park area, these isolated peaks jut up on the other side of the broad valley that borders the big Wicklow range on the east.\n Ulysses makes several mentions of the \"Roundwood\" municipal water reservoir that lies about halfway up this broad valley. It was created in the 1860s by damming the Vartry River—hence the mentions of \"Vartry water\" in Sirens and Eumaeus. Bloom also recalls a school trip to a waterfall at \"Poulaphouca\" on the Liffey, about ten miles away on the western side of the Wicklow Mountains. That area now holds another, even larger reservoir, built in the 1930s and 40s by damming the Liffey. Both supply clean, fresh water to the metropolis, and the construction of the Vartry reservoir greatly reduced disease in 19th century Dublin.\n Finally, Ulysses briefly mentions \"Glendalough,\" the famous monastery which St. Kevin founded in the 6th century in a remote and inspiringly beautiful valley of two lakes on the eastern edge of the mountains, about ten miles southwest of the Vartry reservoir. The monastery appears in Cyclopsas just one in a long list of Ireland's scenic glories, but Kevin becomes an important figure in Finnegans Wake. His monastery flourished for six centuries until a gradual decline in the 13th and 14th centuries, punctuated by the destruction of most of its buildings by English forces in 1398."

    "note": " The \"wild geese,\" Irish Catholic fighters expatriated by unsuccessful resistance to British rule, come up several times in Ulysses, beginning in Proteus. The term usually refers to soldiers who left Ireland in the 17th and 18th centuries to join foreign armies, and later chapters mention the military and political exploits of these men and their descendants, but Stephen applies the phrase to Kevin Egan, a Fenian from the 1860s who has been living quietly in Paris.",
    "expandedNote": " Stephen's proximity to \"the Pigeonhouse\" makes him think of Léo Taxil's funny story about the Virgin Mary's insemination by a pigeon, and that memory triggers a long recollection of the time he spent in Paris with Patrice Egan, the young man who told him about Taxil's book. But he is also thinking of a second kind of bird, since Patrice's father is a \"wild goose\": an Irish patriot who has fled his homeland for the Continent.\n The term was apparently first coined to describe expatriate Irish soldiers who had supported the English Stuart monarch James II during his struggle against Protestant forces loyal to William of Orange. After James' defeat at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, two treaties were signed at Limerick in 1691 which gave Jacobite soldiers under the command of Patrick Sarsfield the choice of returning to their homes, joining the victorious army, or emigrating to France or other Catholic European nations. Over 14,000 Irish soldiers, many of them with their families, emigrated to France where James maintained an army. Others went to Spain or Austria.\n Some Irish Catholic troops had already served in Spanish armies in the 1580s and 90s, fighting against the English in the Low Countries. In 1607 the \"Flight of the Earls\" after their defeat in the Nine Years' War brought more Irish soldiers into service to the Spanish crown, but as Spanish power declined over the next century and French power rose, France became the more attractive destination. Sarsfield's wild geese, whose flight to Europe recalled the Flight of the Earls 85 years earlier, kept their regimental colors but joined a French army that nearly invaded England in 1692. A half century later, after facing another such Jacobite revolt in Scotland, the British reconsidered their policy of encouraging disaffected young Irish Catholics to leave their country and join foreign armies.\n In Aeolus, the mention of Austrian cattle in Mr. Deasy's letter sends Myles Crawford off into a recollection of how the son of one of the Austrian \"Wild geese,\" an O'Donnell, saved the life of the Austrian emperor in 1853. Gifford notes that \"The O'Donnells in Spain and Austria were one of the most famous of the wild-goose families.\" In Cyclops, John Wyse Nolan bitterly proclaims that \"We gave our best blood to France and Spain, the wild geese. Fontenoy, eh? And Sarsfield and O'Donnell, duke of Tetuan in Spain, and Ulysses Browne of Camus that was fieldmarshal to Maria Teresa. But what did we ever get for it?\" \n At the battle of \"Fontenoy\" in the Low Countries in 1745, which proved crucial to the stability of the French ancien régime, the Irish Brigade in the French army fought with great distinction against the British and their allies. Leopold \"O'Donnell,\" a 19th century descendant of the Spanish O'Donnells, was the first Duke of Tetuan, the first count of Lucena, and the first Viscount of Aliaga, and he served three separate terms as Prime Minister of Spain in the 1850s and 60s. \"Ulysses\" Maximilian, Count von Browne, an Austrian-born son of a Jacobite exiled after the Battle of the Boyne, served with great valor as a colonel, lieutenant field marshal, and field marshal in the Austrian army in the 1730s, 40s and 50s and was made Count of the Empire by Charles VI. When John Wyse says that this general officer was \"of Camus,\" he is mixing him up with another, nearly contemporary Irish Count de Browne, this one from Camus in County Limerick. (According to the genealogical book Browne/Brown by Lanette Brown Brightwell, they were kinsmen.) As a result of the disappointment of Irish Catholic hopes after the Battle of the Boyne, George Browne's parents sent him off to seek military success in foreign lands. After fighting with skill and courage in the Russian army he rose to the rank of field marshal in the Russian army, and like Ulysses Maximilian Browne he was favored by \"Maria Teresa,\" the queen of Hungary and archduchess of Austria.\n In Circe, the brilliant success of all these Irish noblemen serving in Spanish, Austrian, French, and Russian armies (and even governments) briefly hoists its banner aloft as \"DON EMILE PATRIZIO FRANZ RUPERT POPE HENNESSY\" appears \"In medieval hauberk, two wild geese volant on his helm.\" In the language of heraldry, \"volant\" means \"in flight.\" \n Joyce's Kevin Egan, a stand-in for the revolutionary Joseph Casey, has emigrated to Paris after his release from London's Clerkenwell prison. Though not a member of a French army, he perhaps deserves the term \"wild goose\" as someone who allegedly once took up arms against the English and now lives in exile. And his son Patrice (or Patrick) is continuing the long tradition of serving in European armies. Near the end of Stephen's long recollection of the Egans, Kevin says, \"Mon fils, soldier of France.\""

    "note": " When Haines asks whether Stephen's Shakespeare theory is \"some paradox,\" and Mulligan says that \"We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes,\" they are referring to something that had been all the rage in bohemian England and Ireland in the 1880s and 90s, but whose star was fading in 1904. Telemachus has already alluded to one of Oscar Wilde’s paradoxes, the sayings about Caliban from The Picture of Dorian Gray.",

I am always satisfied with the best.\n Arguments are to be avoided; they are always vulgar and often convincing.\n The critic has to educate the public. The artist has to educate the critic.\n There are two ways of disliking poetry. One is to dislike it, the other is to read Pope.\n There are two ways of disliking art. One is to dislike it. The other is to like it rationally.\n In this world there are only two tragedies. One is not getting what one wants, and the other is getting it.\n Scandal is gossip made tedious by morality.\n Selfishness is not living as one wishes to live, it is asking others to live as one wishes to live.\n I think that God in creating Man somewhat overestimated his ability.\n We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars.\n What is a cynic? A man who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.\n Reflecting on his style of wit, Wilde also said, “The way of paradoxes is the way of truth. To test Reality we must see it on the tightrope. When the Verities become acrobats, we can judge them.” The playful witticisms quoted above are paradoxes in the truest and best sense: they work against commonly received opinion (para = beyond, contrary to + doxa = opinion), and their contradictions, which may seem merely flippant when first heard, make cogent sense when examined closely. It seems doubtful that Mulligan has much appreciation for this truth-telling function of Wildean paradoxes. But Stephen, whose Shakespeare talk is replete with verbal play, contrary views, and self-contradiction, is driving at a serious purpose."

Will-o'-the-wisps are ghostly lights that hover over swamps at night, constantly receding, drawing travelers into unseen dangers. In Goethe's Faust, one leads to a Witches' Sabbath.",
    "expandedNote": " In Hades, Bloom thinks of them in practical terms, as perhaps caused by off-gassing: \"Will o' the wisp. Gas of graves.\" But Gifford observes that 'In folklore, the will-o'-the-wisp is considered ominous, often thought to be a soul rejected by hell and condemned to carry its own hellcoal on its wanderings.\" In the 21st scene of Part 1 of Faust, he notes, a will-o'-the-wisp \"lights the way up the 'magic-mad' mountain as Faust and Mephistopheles make their way toward the Walpurgisnacht (Witches' Sabbath) assembly.\" \n Walpurga's Night, celebrated in Germanic countries on the night beginning May 1, is named after an early Christian saint. But German literature, in the centuries leading up to Goethe, depicted it as a night when witches and sorcerers convened, often on the boulders of a mountain called the Brocken, to commune with devils, practice orgiastic rites, and celebrate the coming of spring. People in Germany, Scandinavia, the Netherlands, and lands that were once part of Prussia still observe the holiday with eating, drinking, huge bonfires, and (sometimes) witch paraphernalia, in a spirit of carnival celebration. \n It is probably significant that, in that 21st scene of the first part of Faust, Mephistopheles seeks to divert Faust's thoughts from the tragic fate of his lover Gretchen by introducing him to a beautiful and quite naked young witch, but Faust is pulled away from this sexual temptation by a vision of Gretchen. In Circe Bloom follows Stephen through the streets of Monto into a house of ill repute, and all the available female flesh on display turns Bloom's thoughts to Molly and the sexual preoccupations that complicate his relation with her."

    "note": " Just before the funeral carriage passes over the River Liffey in Hades, Bloom catches sight of \"Smith O'Brien. Someone has laid a bunch of flowers there. Woman. Must be his deathday. For many happy returns. The carriage wheeling by Farrell's statue united noiselessly their unresisting knees.\" The marble statue of William Smith O'Brien, a mid-19th century Irish patriot, was sculpted in 1869 by Sir Thomas Farrell, who also made Sir John Gray's statue, and erected where D'Olier and Westmoreland Streets join just south of O'Connell Bridge. In 1929 Farrell's statue was moved across the river to a new location on O'Connell Street. The \"deathday\" engraved on the statue is probably inaccurate.",
    "expandedNote": " William Smith O'Brien was a landed Protestant gentleman in County Clare whose family traced its ancestry to Brian Boru. He became an Irish nationalist Member of Parliament and eventually a leader in Daniel O'Connell's movement to repeal the Act of Union with Great Britain. With O'Connell's imprisonment in 1844, the Repeal Association fell into disarray, and the more militant Young Ireland movement gained authority, led by Smith O'Brien and others. It formed the Irish Confederation in 1847 and staged an abortive armed uprising in 1848.\n In July 1848, a detachment of Young Irelanders led by Smith O'Brien attacked a unit of the Royal Irish Constabulary in Ballingary, a town in County Tipperary. They carried a new flag, the tricolor that now represents the Republic of Ireland, in imitation of French revolutionaries who carried their red, white, and blue tricolor through the streets of Paris earlier in the same year. Forty-seven policemen barricaded themselves in a large farmhouse, holding five children as hostages and ignoring pleas from the children's mother to free them. When gunshots interrupted Smith O'Brien's attempt to negotiate the children's release, several people died. \n Smith O'Brien was apprehended, charged with high treason, convicted, and, with three others, sentenced to hanging, drawing, and quartering—one of the last impositions of that sentence in British history. After 80,000 people in Ireland and England signed petitions for clemency, and at the insistence of Queen Victoria, who decided that the punishment was a touch harsh for the crime, his sentence was commuted to penal servitude, and he was transported to Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania). In 1854 he received a conditional pardon and resettled in Brussels. In 1856 he received a full pardon and returned to Ireland, but he did not return to politics. He died in 1864. The statue identifies his \"deathday\" as June 16, but most sources say that it was in fact June 18. \n James Stephens was present in the Ballingary action and was wounded by gunfire, but he escaped capture by feigning death. After fleeing to Paris, he returned in the 1850s to found the Irish Republican Brotherhood, the counterpart of the Fenian movement in America. This connection between the two men, and their respective revolutionary movements, makes it possible that it is this \"O'Brien\" that Bloom thinks of in Calypso, just after thinking of Stephens. But Gifford notes that there are two other plausible candidates: J. F. X. O'Brien, a Fenian arrested in 1867, and J. P. O'Brien, superintendent of the baths in Tara Street. In the context of the sequence of Bloom's thoughts, the last of these men is perhaps the most likely. \n In Circe, when \"Pandemonium\" breaks out and Irish heroes fight duels with one another, one of the matches is \"Smith O'Brien against Daniel O'Connell.\" Although the spirit of the passage is absurdist, there is some historical basis for this opposition. Smith O'Brien always supported Catholic Emancipation, but he at first opposed O'Connell's movement to Repeal the Act of Union. When O'Connell was arrested in 1843 for conducting his \"monster meetings,\" however, Smith O'Brien joined the Repeal Association and became its second most influential voice. After O'Connell's death he allied himself with those who pursued militant, non-parliamentary avenues to independence—a more radical step than O'Connell was ever willing to take. \n The two men thus did not always see eye to eye, and indeed the whole climate of Irish political organizing in the 1830s and 40s was marked by such violently shifting alliances and acrimonious recriminations that Circe's picture of \"duels with cavalry sabres\" is not a completely unapt analogy."

For a woman who was no better than she should be, Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten years the Greeks made war on Troy. A faithless wife first brought the strangers to our shore here, MacMurrough's wife and her leman, O'Rourke, prince of Breffni. A woman too brought Parnell low.\" What is one to make of all the misogyny? One possibility is that there has been adultery in Deasy's marital past.",
    "expandedNote": " In addition to Eve, who tempted Adam to transgress God's command and thereby \"brought sin into the world,\" Deasy mentions \"Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus,\" whose adulterous elopement with Paris occasioned the long and catastrophic Trojan War. Stuart Gilbert argues that this reference to ancient Greek history makes Deasy like Nestor in the Odyssey, since Nestor tells Telemachus about the adulterous Clytemnestra's murderous reception of her husband.\n Two more references to adultery follow. Another \"faithless wife\" who caused disaster was Devorgilla, the spouse of \"O'Rourke, prince of Breffni,\" whose adulterous elopement with Diarmait \"MacMurrough,\" the king of Leinster, contributed to MacMurrough's deposition and subsequent conspiracy with the English king Henry II to launch the first Anglo-Saxon invasion of Ireland, and thus \"first brought the strangers to our shores here.\" Thornton observes that Deasy has managed to switch the two men, turning MacMurrough into the husband and O'Rourke into the lover: Deasy gets his facts wrong once more. \n But this domestic history seems to be a staple of Irish political mythology. In Cyclops, the Citizen makes the same claim about how the \"strangers\" came to Ireland: \"Our own fault. We let them come in. We brought them in. The adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxon robbers here. . . . A dishonoured wife, . . . that's what's the cause of all our misfortunes.\" A third faithless wife, Katherine O'Shea, \"brought Parnell low\" when their adulterous affair was discovered. \n Deasy's list of female sinners makes an odd lead-in to his assertion that \"we\" have committed \"Many errors, many failures but not the one sin,\" which seems to reprise his claim that the Jews \"sinned against the light.\" And it does not contribute intelligibly to the exchanges he has been having with Stephen about Jews, Catholics, Protestants, Tories, and Fenians. \n It may, however, make some sense in terms of Deasy's personal life. In Aeolus Myles Crawford tells Stephen that he knows Deasy, \"and I knew his wife too. The bloodiest old tartar God ever made. By Jesus, she had the foot and mouth disease and no mistake! The night she threw the soup in the waiter's face in the Star and Garter. Oho!\" After recalling Deasy's misogynistic catalogue, Stephen asks the editor whether Deasy is a widower. Crawford replies, \"Ay, a grass one,\" i.e. a man separated from his wife."

And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain\" (18:44-45).\n While Stephen attributes his collapse in the brothel to thismalignant divine agency, Bloom sees it as the result of \"gastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength, accelerated by mental exertion and the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere,\" i.e. the mad whirling dance that Stephen, Lynch, and the three prostitutes enjoyed in the brothel. Since this dance immediately preceded the apparition of Stephen's mother as a ghoul commanding him to repent, the two interpretations are not totally unrelated.

    "note": " First impressions of Bloom in Calypso suggest many differences from Stephen, one being his interest in modern experimental science. Whereas Stephen can think, at the end of the previous chapter, \"My teeth are very bad. Why, I wonder,\" without displaying the slightest interest in the nature of teeth, Bloom brims with questions about empirical phenomena. Having only a high school education—an education from which he is twenty years removed—he comes up with some clownishly inexact answers. But he does have both curiosity and a nose for the scientific truth, as his thoughts about cats \"in the dark\" and black clothes in \"The sun\" demonstrate.",
    "expandedNote": " Looking at his cat's \"bristles shining wirily in the weak light,\" he thinks: \"Wonder is it true if you clip them they can't mouse after. Why? They shine in the dark, perhaps, the tips. Or kind of feelers in the dark, perhaps.\" It is indeed true that cats whose whiskers are cut back become spatially disoriented; they sense their environment less well and lose their grace at walking and jumping, not to mention hunting. The whiskers do not shine in the dark. Bloom's second hypothesis, however, is substantially correct. The cat's long facial hairs (known anatomically as vibrissae) are organs of touch. Lodged in follicles beneath the rest of the cat's hairs, they connect to sensitive nerve endings and register the slightest movements of air, allowing the cat to perceive things that it cannot see or directly touch. Trimming them not only profoundly alters a cat's proprioceptive sense but also distorts its picture of its near surroundings. It is fair to say that they are \"kind of feelers in the dark.\"\n Bloom's experiential sense that on a sunny day he will be hotter in his black clothes than \"in that light suit\" prompts him to dredge up some concepts of how solar radiation responds to different materials: \"The sun was nearing the steeple of George's church. Be a warm day I fancy. Specially in these black clothes feel it more. Black conducts, reflects, (refracts is it?), the heat.\" The triad of technical terms perhaps comes from Bloom's high school classes, but he misremembers one of them and muddles the distinction between light and heat. A ray of light (today described as a wave or beam of photons) encountering matter can behave in several different ways. If it is not simply \"transmitted\" through the material with its vector unchanged and its energy intact, it will undergo \"absorption,\" \"reflection,\" or \"refraction.\" If absorbed, it imparts its energy to the surrounding material in the form of heat. If reflected, it bounces off the surface of the material at the same angle at which it approached. If refracted, it passes through the material at an altered angle. (Two other phenomena, \"diffraction\" and \"scattering,\" occur when the beam is broken up into many separate beams traveling in different directions.) \n The scientifically correct answer to Bloom's question is that a black material absorbs most of the incoming solar radiation. (A white material like snow will reflect most of it, absorbing only a little as thermal energy and thus acting as an insulator for the snow beneath. A red material will reflect the red wavelengths of the radiation and absorb most of the others. And so on.) But although he substitutes \"conducts\" for \"absorbs,\" and then wanders off into correct terms that offer the wrong answers, Bloom's first instinct is on the right track. Conduction is the process by which \"heat,\" once imparted to matter by the absorption of radiant energy, is transmitted from one region of the material substance to surrounding regions that possess less thermal energy. Its action in the dark clothes is thus closely related to the absorption of sunlight that imparts the energy to the clothes in the first place."

    "note": " Bloom recognizes the girl standing ahead of him in the butchershop in Calypso—she is \"the nextdoor girl\"—and he knows the name of her employer: \"His eyes rested on her vigorous hips. Woods his name is. Wonder what he does.\" Joyce here took advantage of both the strengths and the weaknesses of his reliance on Thom's directory, reproducing the common urban and suburban phenomenon of knowing a neighbor's name but not his occupation. As the next few paragraphs unfold, Bloom weaves together what he knows and does not know about the family, as well as the imagery of the butchershop, in a lascivious fantasy about a vulnerable young woman.",
    "expandedNote": " Bloom's speculation about Mr. Woods goes straight to his domestic arrangement: \"Wife is oldish. New blood. No followers allowed.\" By his suspicious logic, the servant girl is not at 8 Eccles just to perform domestic chores, but to provide a remedy to the problem of an aging wife. \"No followers\" was a common Dublin employment condition to keep maids from bringing distracting and possibly felonious boyfriends or suitors to their place of work. Bloom imagines Woods laying down this condition to establish a monopoly of sexual access to his attractive young helper. \n He is clearly extrapolating from personal experience. Circe dramatizes the erotic interest he took in a \"scullerymaid\" named Mary Driscoll, which may have led to a physical advance on his part, and which may have emboldened Mary to steal some oysters from the Blooms. Molly thinks about the events in Penelope, remembering Mary \"padding out her false bottom to excite him\" and stealing potatoes and oysters, and suspecting that Bloom's complicity gave her some encouragement to act so outrageously.\n Bloom's propensity for voyeurism combines with his identification with a fellow employer to make the girl next door an object of erotic longing: \"Strong pair of arms. Whacking a carpet on the clothesline. She does whack it, by George. The way her crooked skirt swings at each whack.\" Bloom clearly has gazed into his neighbor's back yard when the servant girl was working there. He may not have quite imagined himself a carpet, but his appreciation of her aggressive vigor implies some masochistic interest in this young woman. Consistent with his markedanality, he seems also to have been particularly excited by the sight of her \"vigorous hips,\" which he is now staring at again. \n Standing in a place where meat is sold, his admiration of the woman's rump becomes translated into the language of commodification and consumption: \"Sound meat there: like a stallfed heifer.\" Bloom remembers his days in the cattle market, when the breeders would walk among the stock, \"slapping a palm on a ripemeated hindquarter, there's a prime one, unpeeled switches in their hands.\" He hopes that his business will be concluded quickly enough \"To catch up and walk behind her if she went slowly, behind her moving hams.\"\n The \"Brown scapulars in tatters\" that the poor girl wears, \"defending her both ways,\" testify to her vulnerability working for low wages in a home far from her own, unprotected by male relatives. As if in recognition of this fact, Bloom's fantasy concludes with the thought that she is not really for Mr. Woods or for himself, but \"For another: a constable off duty cuddled her in Eccles lane. They like them sizeable. Prime sausage. O please, Mr Policeman, I'm lost in the wood.\" Either Bloom has actually seen the girl flirting with such a policeman in Eccles Lane, which runs behind Eccles Street to the hospital, or he has imagined it. Such a hero can rescue a damsel lost in the Woods, he wittily supposes.\n Gifford notes that the 1904 Thom's lists a Mr. R. Woods as living at 8 Eccles Street, one door west of Bloom's house, and that \"He is listed again under 'Nobility, Gentry, Merchants, and Traders' (p. 2043), but his vocation is not identified.\" In giving a place in the narrative to someone who actually lived in the neighborhood, Joyce continued the verisimilitude maintained by placing the fictional Bloom in a house that was unoccupied in 1904. But in fact Thom's was wrong about the person living in the house next door in 1904. \"R. Woods\" was Rosanna Woods, wife of Patrick, and although the couple had lived together in the house at the time of the national census in 1901, they separated in 1902 and after that Rosanna lived at 8 Eccles Street either alone or with her daughter Mary Kate. For more on the Woods, see the note on the James Joyce Online Notes website."

    "note": " Amid the welter of attacks in Circe after Bloom's apotheosis as Messiah and before his immolation by the Inquisition comes one silent accusation from \"A DEADHAND\": \"(Writes on the wall.) Bloom is a cod.\" This hallucination clearly recalls the writing on Belshazzar's wall in the Hebrew Bible, but one must look back to earlier passages in Ulysses, and forward to one in Finnegans Wake, for a full appreciation of its implications.",
    "expandedNote": " Chapter 4 of the book of Daniel narrates the story of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, who received a warning from the God of his Hebrew captives when he dreamed of a mighty tree that is hacked down to a stump. Summoned for an interpretation, Daniel announces that the dream means that Nebuchadnezzar will lose his throne and be driven away from the dwellings of men unless he forsakes his \"sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor\" (4:27). After the passage of a year, the king is still proud, and the dream's prophecy is fulfilled: he is driven away from the city and lives like a wild beast until he praises the kingdom of God and acknowledges the nothingness of mankind. \n Chapter 5 tells the story of Nebuchadnezzar's son and successor Belshazzar, who displays similar pride by staging a great feast in which wine is drunk from golden cups looted from the temple in Jerusalem, and idols are praised. \"In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the king's palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote\" (5:5). When the shaken Belshazzar cannot get a satisfactory explanation from his astrologers and soothsayers, he sends for Daniel as his father did, asking for an interpretation of the words which the hand has written on his wall: \"MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN\" (5:25). \n Daniel observes that Belshazzar has displayed the same sin of pride that brought down his father, and he glosses the strange words: \"MENE; God numbered thy kingdom, and finished it. TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting. PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians\" (5:26-28). (\"Peres\" and \"Upharsin\" are forms of the same root word, \"divide.\") Belshazzar is killed \"that night,\" and Darius of Media (no relation to Rupert Murdoch) takes over the kingdom (5:30-31). \n The words on the wall do not figure in Ulysses, but Finnegans Wake shows that Joyce was well aware of them and the message they send: \"Can you rede (since We and Thou had it out already) its world? It is the same told of all. Many. Miscegenations on miscegenations. Tieckle. They lived und laughed ant loved end left. Forsin. Thy thingdome is given to the Meades and Porsons\" (18). As Roland McHugh notes, the Quran uses \"We\" to refer to God, \"Thou\" for Muhammad, and \"Ye\" for the reader, so these sentences challenge You the reader to interpret the meaning of words that God and His prophet have set out in divine script.\n § The interpretation of these sentences in the Wake must be at least glancingly political, as in the book of Daniel, because \"thingdome\" combines the kingdom of Babylon with the thingmote of Viking Dublin. But sexual suggestions predominate. Apparently the story of the world, told over and over again, is of \"Many\" sexual transgressions: one miscegenation after another. \"Tieckle,\" in the context of people living and laughing and loving and leaving, suggests sexual play, and Buck Mulligan's words at the beginning of Scylla and Charybdis show that Joyce heard such an association: \"First he tickled her / Then he patted her / Then he passed the female catheter.\" \"Forsin\" may evoke the Latin forsan (perhaps), but it also suggests the foreskin whose introduction follows the tickling.\n Reading backward from this passage in the Wake, one may feel justified in listening for sexual as well as political meanings in Circe's writing on the wall. \"Cod,\" which in Middle English meant bag, scrotum, or testicles, came down into modern usage through the penis-holding pouches of 15th and 16th century men's tights called codpieces. The Irish phrase \"only codding,\" which originally meant \"only kidding,\" may derive from the false implications of massive male endowment conveyed by these Renaissance equivalents of padded bras. By that logic, \"Bloom is a cod\" may mean that he does not have the goods in the wedding tackle department. But the fact that he has sired two children constitutes an effective rebuttal. It is not Bloom's natural endowment that is in question, but his willingness to put it to use. Read as an accusation modeled on the political indictment of Belshazzar in Daniel 5, the sentence may be sung to a tune from Oxen of the Sun: \"You have a penis with testicles attached. Why are you not using it properly, to pleasure your wife and beget offspring? Your domestic kingdom is in serious peril, with a conqueror rapping at the gate with his loud proud knocker. You can be replaced.\"\n A determined reader who knows the Bible and Finnegans Wake could get all this from brooding on just the ten words in Circe, but Joyce makes it a little easier by staging several earlier scenes in which Bloom sees some writing on the wall. In Aeolus, as he descends the staircase of the newspaper office, he thinks, \"Who the deuce scrawled all over these walls with matches? Looks as if they did it for a bet.\" Who the deuce did it (God? one of Bloom's detractors? nobody remotely comparable?) is a minor mystery never explained, but the look of having been done \"with matches\" offers an interesting juxtaposition with the Bible's report that the hand \"wrote over against the candlestick.\" The impression that this passage may echo Daniel 5:5 is supported by the fact that some versions of the Bible story say that the message was written in ash. \n Two other linguistic echoes jump out. Calypso has played with the idea that \"Matcham's masterstroke\" is about people being \"matched\" in marriage. Does the writing on the wall suggest that Bloom is poorly matched and Boylan would be a better match? And why or how would Bloom possibly infer that the writing on the wall was done \"for a bet,\" unless these two words merge to suggest that the writing was done to \"abet\" (assist, encourage, instigate) the crime that will be committed at 7 Eccles Street starting at about 4:00? Perhaps some other convincing explanation will eventually be offered for this strange passage in a strange chapter, but until then it is reasonable to suppose that Bloom is being shown some writing on the wall.\n Bloom is an advertising man, and ads were plastered over every wall in Dublin in 1904, yet he can make little sense of the scrawled letters in Aeolus. He is given further opportunities, however. In Lestrygonians the thought of ads on walls makes him worry that Boylan may give Molly a disease: \"All kinds of places are good for ads. That quack doctor for the clap used to be stuck up in all the greenhouses. Never see it now. . . . Some chap with a dose burning him. / If he...? / O! / Eh? / No... No. / No, no. I don't believe it. He wouldn't surely? / No, no.\" These remembered ads were posted on the walls of urinals by the quack doctor himself or by people he hired, not by an unknown hand, but the evanescence of the biblical letters figures in their temporal nature (Slote observes that ads for STD cures were illegal in Dublin at this time), as well as the fact that local wits have erased parts of other words to make ones more encouraging of hawking medicines: \"Flybynight. Just the place too. POST NO BILLS. POST 110 PILLS.\" \n As he stumbles into the streets of Monto early in Circe, Bloom sees yet more writing on the wall, this time with unmistakably sexual content. On \"the wall\" (unspecified) an image appears: \"(He gazes ahead, reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend Wet Dream and a phallic design.)\" The captioned prick makes him think of his wife: \"Odd! Molly drawing on the frosted carriagepane at Kingstown. What's that like?\" Well, Kingstown sounds like kingdom, a wet dream represents an unfulfilled desire, and frost suggests icy disdain. Just as a Freudian dreamer delves into his dream through the waking associations it prompts, Bloom's thoughts about the hallucinated image point the way toward understanding it as a comment on the threatened state of his domestic polity.\n By the time that a disembodied hand actually writes on the wall, then, Ulysses has gradually and subtly schooled its readers to think that such writing may offer some kind of prophecy about the ruination of Bloom's marriage, just as the obscure writing in Daniel prophesied the end of Belshazzar's kingdom. For a novel inspired by Homer and Dante, whose epics teem with prophecies about their protagonists, such dark writing should seem only par for the course."

  "080011xrays": {
    "note": " \"X rays,\" also known as \"Röntgen rays,\" were discovered only eight or nine years before the time represented in Ulysses. They seized the imagination of ordinary people like Bloom, whose thoughts on the subject seem more than usually fuzzy.",
    "expandedNote": " In 1895 Wilhelm Röntgen, who held the physics chair at Würtzburg University in Germany, was working with a cathode-ray tube in his laboratory. He found that some kind of radiation was exciting fluorescent materials far removed from the tube (cathode rays were known to travel only a few centimeters in air). He blocked the tube with heavy cardboard and ensured that no light was entering the room, but the fluorescence was not abated. With further experiments, he found that the mysterious rays could penetrate many opaque materials including human flesh, but could not penetrate far into denser materials like metal and bone. He also found that they could produce images on photographic plates.\n Several days before Christmas in the same year, Röntgen used his cathode-ray apparatus to take a radiographic image of his wife Bertha's hand. Several days after Christmas, he submitted an article describing his findings, along with the picture, to a scholarly journal. The article excited widespread interest, the picture became famous, and Röntgen won a Nobel prize in 1901. He named his mysterious findings X-rays, but much of the world called them Röntgen rays. Their diagnostic potential was recognized immediately: in 1896 a number of physicians and surgeons used the new rays to look inside patients' bodies, and at least two medical handbooks, Practical Radiography and The X-ray, or, Photography of the Invisible and its Value in Surgery, were published.\n For more details of this story, see Dean Zollman's 2015 blog \"Wonders of the X-ray\" at kimrendfeld.wordpress.com, summarizing an article that was published in the American Journal of Roentgenology in 1931, and \"History of Radiography,\" another blog on the NDT Resource Center at www.nde-ed.org.\n In Lestrygonians, a chapter concerned with the human alimentary canal, Bloom walks along Duke Street \"toward Dawson street, his tongue brushing his teeth smooth\" after his lunch in Davy Byrne's pub. The narrative finds him in the middle of an obscure train of thoughts: \"Something green it would have to be: spinach, say. Then with those Röntgen rays searchlight you could.\" It is not at all clear why he thinks that green objects would show up better than others under X-rays (they do not, of course). \n In Eumaeus the reader is treated to another display of obscure reasoning when Bloom tries to persuade Stephen that human intelligence can be attributed to \"convolutions of the grey matter\" rather than to the actions of an immortal soul: \"Otherwise we would never have such inventions as X rays, for instance.\" The bizarre logic seems to be that only intelligence produced in a scientifically comprehensible way could possibly produce scientific discoveries."

  "010004yellowdressinggown": {
    "note": " The text gives less obvious encouragement to reading symbolic significance into Mulligan's \"yellow dressinggown\" than it does with mirrors and razors, but in Christian countries this color had long been associated with heresy and treachery. In Circe these associations settle on Bloom.",
    "expandedNote": " Quoting George Ferguson's Signs and Symbols in Christian Art (1954), Gifford notes that \"the traitor Judas is frequently painted in a garment of dingy yellow. In the Middle Ages heretics were obliged to wear yellow\" (153). After the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215, some countries forced Jews to wear a yellow badge on their clothing. After the Albigensian Crusade ended in 1229, the Papal Inquisition of Pope Gregory IX decreed that all remaining Cathars would wear yellow crosses on their clothing as a similar badge of shame. This practice was part of a broad cultural effort to stigmatize certain groups. (In some countries paupers who had received relief from the parish were made to wear red or blue badges on one shoulder, in order to make seeking such relief unappealing.) Islamic countries with large Jewish and Christian populations had done the same thing in earlier centuries. In the 20th century, the Nazis in Germany revived these medieval badges of shame, forcing Jews to sew yellow stars of David on their clothes and making homosexuals wear pink triangles.\n Since Stephen associates Mulligan with heresy later in Telemachus, the fact that Buck likes to wear yellow clothing is very suggestive. Later in Telemachus we learn that his waistcoat too is \"primrose\" colored.\n In Circe, Bloom is immolated by an Irish version of the Inquisition after being given such clothes to wear. Brother Buzz \"Invests Bloom in a yellow habit with embroidery of painted flames and high pointed hat. He places a bag of gunpowder round his neck and hands him over to the civil power,\" saying, \"Forgive him his trespasses.\"\n Of course, it is Bloom rather than Mulligan that most Dubliners would see as a heretic. Half-Jewish by ancestry (his father converted before his marriage, but tried to instill Jewish traditions in his son), half-Protestant by affiliation (raised in the Church of Ireland and a Freemason later in life), and fully atheistical by temperament (he disbelieves in the incorporeal soul and a host of other Christian teachings), Bloom is quite inevitably an object of suspicion to most of the Catholic Irishmen he meets."

  "180005yesyes": {
    "note": " Molly Bloom’s monologue begins and ends with \"Yes,\" a word which she repeats throughout Penelope. The effect is as consciously rhetorical on Joyce's part as any linguistic patterning in Aeolus or Oxen of the Sun. Its circular return carries important intertextual echoes, and the word itself is rich with suggestive power. It expresses the ambivalence of a woman skeptically examining the circumstances of her life and coming to a final affirmation of its value.",
    "expandedNote": " Ithaca ends with anticipations of Joyce's final book,Finnegans Wake, by showing Bloom drifting off to sleep and thinking rambling thoughts. Penelope extends the prolepsis by showing Molly hovering somewhere between sleep and waking, fusing present experience with memories of the past, seemingly thinking outside the bounds of time. Formal linguistic patterning enforces the resemblance. The Wake is written as a closed loop, ending with a word, \"the,\" that is no end at all but rather an article introducing the novel's first word, \"riverrun.\" Penelope achieves a slightly different effect through repetition of its opening word. \n One name for this in rhetorical theory is epanalepsis (a \"taking again\"), which Gideon O. Burton defines as \"Repetition of the same word or clause after intervening matter. More strictly, repetition at the end of a line, phrase, or clause of the word or words that occurred at the beginning of the same line, phrase, or clause\" (Silva Rhetoricae, at rhetoric.byu.edu). Of the four examples that Burton gives, one seems particularly comparable to what Joyce does in Penelope: \"In times like these, it is helpful to remember that there have always been times like these\" (Paul Harvey). The phrase in this sentence is not simply repeated; its repetition carries a new spirit that changes one's understanding of the initial utterance. Molly's \"yes\" does something similar across the span of 24, 076 intervening words. \n That a reader can hear this distance-defying effect owes not only to the abstract influence of re-reading and analysis but also to the 90 other appearances of the word \"yes\" in the chapter, which condition one to listen for its concluding reappearance. This gentle percussive signifier in Molly's monologue, which swells to a pounding heartbeat in the last page or so of text, could probably be named by several rhetorical terms. In addition to epanalepsis there is conduplicatio (\"doubling\"), the repetition of a key word in successive phrases, clauses, or sentences to impart emphasis, amplify thought, or express emotion, and epinome (\"tarrying\"), which has been variously defined as \"the frequent repetition of a phrase or question,\" \"dwelling on a point,\" or \"persistent repetition of the same plea in much the same words.\" The terms are, of course, less important than recognition of the effects that such insistent repetition can bring about. \n Penelope maps a movement from Molly’s conversation with herself, marked by introspective suspicion, to an intimate exchange with her husband, marked by mutual understanding. \"Yes\" is pivotal to both these internal and external conversations. The chapter begins with an unspoken question: Was there anything suspicious about Bloom’s behavior tonight? Molly's answer: “Yes because he never did a thing like that before …” Unspoken follow-up questions ensue: Has he had sex with another woman tonight? Is there any evidence of it? \n The \"yes because\" formulation expresses Molly's detective work: \"yes because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something a letter when I came into the front room to show him Dignams death in the paper as if something told me and he covered it up with the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably that was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is now so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it\"; \"yes because he couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere.\" Molly is wrong about Bloom having had sex on June 16, unless masturbating on the beach counts—and it may, since she thinks only \"yes he came somewhere Im sure\"—but she is certainly right about the exchange of money involved in his relationship with Martha Clifford.\n By the end of the chapter, Bloom is allowed to speak for himself. In two remarkable passages, the narrative signifiers of a remembered conversation crowd into Molly's language almost as frequently as do her yeses: \"the sun shines for youhe said the day we were lying among the rhododendrons on Howth head . . . the day I got him to propose to me yes . . . yes he said I was a flower of the mountain yes so we are flowers all a womans body yes that was one true thing he said in his life and the sun shines for you today yes . . . I gave him all the pleasure I could leading him on till he asked me to say yes\"; \"and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes.\" \n Out of the movement from suspicious introspection at the beginning of the chapter to affirmative engagement at its end, Joyce crafts his ambiguous but happy ending, one that returns a reader to the beginning not only of the chapter, but also of the marriage. And, in a way, to the beginning of the Bloom family drama in Ulysses: in Calypso, \"hurrying homeward\" to be near his wife's \"ample bedwarmed flesh,\" Bloom thinks, \"Yes, yes.\" The word seems integrally linked with beginnings and endings. When Bloom returns to memories of the first woman he wooed, in Circe, the flirtatious encounter concludes with Josie's Molly-like affirmation: \"(Eagerly.) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. / (She fades from his side . . .)\"\n Joyce associated Molly's key word with a feminine principle of circular return. In an August 1921 letter to Frank Budgen he wrote that Penelope \"begins and ends with the female word yes. It turns like the huge earth ball slowly surely and evenly, round and round spinning, its 4 cardinal points being the female breasts, arse, womb and cunt, expressed by the words because, bottom . . . woman, yes.\" In October of the same year he also remarked on the word's essential property of affirmation. Speaking with his translator Jacques Benoîst-Méchin, he called it \"the most positive word in the human language\" (Ellmann 522). \n The conjunction of circularity and affirmation suggests the influence of Nietzsche. Given the interest in this philosopher expressed in Ulysses, beginning with allusions to thehyperborean life of the übermensch in Telemachus, it seems plausible to hear in Molly's \"yes\" a response to the concept of eternal recurrence, an idea of cyclical history from classical antiquity that Nietzsche preferred to the linear teleology of Christianity. In The Gay Science (a book that sits on Mr. Duffy's shelf in \"A Painful Case\"), Nietzsche posed a hypothetical \"burdensome thought\": Imagine that everything in your life is destined to repeat. You relive pleasant but also painful events endlessly. If there were no alternative, could you still find joy and meaning in your life? Would you say Yes to all its imperfections, frustrations, and tortures, or would you wish to negate it? \n \"Eternal recurrence\" is a fair description of a life story that constantly circles back on itself in memory, as Molly's does, and her final word may well be taken as a Nietzschean affirmation of that imperfect life. Coming at the end not only of her monologue but of Joyce's novel, this capitalized \"Yes\" can also be seen as an instantiation of what Stephen in Ithaca calls \"the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature.\" In an early lecture titled \"Drama and Life,\" Joyce had praised art that tells the truth about human life, no matter how unflattering, and that thereby reveals its eternal truths. Stephen appears to be carrying this view forward into Ulysses, and Molly puts it into practice.\n One more connection to Finnegans Wake deserves mention, even though it has some of the smell of a red herring. When he was writing that book Joyce implied that he had intended a dying-away effect at the end of Ulysses, comparable to Anna Livia's. In a conversation with Louis Gillet reported in Gillet's Stèle pour James Joyce (1941), translated in the 50s as Claybook for James Joyce, he said: \"In Ulysses, to depict the babbling of a woman going to sleep, I had sought to end with the least forceful word I could possibly find. I had found the word ‘yes,’ which is barely pronounced, which denotes acquiescence, self abandon, relaxation, the end of all resistance. In Work in Progress I have tried to do better if I could. This time, I found the word which is the most slippery, the least accented, the weakest word in English, a word which is not even a word, which is scarcely sounded between the teeth, a breath, a nothing, the article the.”\n Wrapped up in concluding the Wake, Joyce may have creatively misremembered some of what he intended while finishing Ulysses. \"The\" can justly be called a word \"which is barely pronounced,\" but few speakers of English would describe \"yes\" as such a word, or declare that it \"denotes\" passivity. Nor does Molly seem to be going away quietly at the end of her monologue: if Joyce had not said so, would any reader imagine that she is falling asleep and babbling? Furthermore, there is some evidence to suggest that Joyce was looking for a strong effect in 1921, not a weak one. Ellmann reports that in the draft of Penelope given to Benoîst-Méchin the final \"Yes\" was \"inscrutably omitted\" (521). Without that word, the book would have ended with \"I will,\" which suggests forceful determination. When the translator \"tacked on\" a final oui Joyce initially resisted, saying that \"the last word of a book is very important.\" \n There may be some middle ground between these seemingly incompatible readings of the end of Ulysses. Ellmann infers that by settling on Yes, \"the most positive word in the human language,\" Joyce chose to emphasize \"submission to a world beyond himself,\" as opposed to the Luciferian resistance implied by \"I will.\" Positivity is by no means incompatible with \"acquiescence, self-abandonment, relaxation, the end of all resistance,\" and even if these terms do not fit Molly as well as they do Anna Livia, \"yes\" could still be seen as a relatively unforceful, yielding conclusion. It would probably be foolish to ignore the resemblance that Joyce saw between Molly and his river-goddess passing beyond the frustrations of her existence and losing herself in the streams of the sea."

The lyrics are below:\n Two fellows were talking about\n Their girls, girls, girls,\n Sweethearts they left behind,\n Sweethearts for whom they pined.\n One said, My little shy little lass \n Has a waist so trim and small;\n Grey are her eyes so bright\n But best, best of all—\n My girl's a Yorkshire girl, \n Yorkshire through and through.\n My girl's a Yorkshire girl, \n Eh, by gum, she's a champion! \n Though she's a fact'ry lass,\n And wears no fancy clothes\n Still I've a sort of a Yorkshire relish for my little Yorkshire Rose.\n When the first finished singing\n The praise of Rose, Rose Rose,\n Poor number two looked vexed,\n Saying in tones perplexed,\n My lass works in a factory too,\n And also has eyes of grey,\n Her name is Rose as well,\n And strange, strange to say—\n My girl's a Yorkshire girl, \n Yorkshire through and through.\n My girl's a Yorkshire girl, \n Eh, by gum, she's a champion! \n Though she's a fact'ry lass,\n And wears no fancy clothes\n Still I've a sort of Yorkshire relish for my little Yorkshire Rose.\n To a cottage in Yorkshire they hied\n To Rose, Rose, Rose,\n Meaning to make it clear\n Which was the boy most dear.\n Rose, their Rose didn't answer the bell,\n But her husband did instead.\n Loudly he sang to them\n As off, off they fled—\n My girl's a Yorkshire girl, \n Yorkshire through and through.\n My girl's a Yorkshire girl, \n Eh, by gum, she's a champion! \n Though she's a fact'ry lass,\n And wears no fancy clothes\n Still I've a sort of Yorkshire relish for my little Yorkshire Rose.\n When Bloom asks Zoe Higgins, \"Where are you from? London?,\" she replies, \"I'm Yorkshire born.\" Much later in Circe, Private Carr and Private Compton start singing the song in the street. Zoe hears them and jumps up in delight: \"That's me. (She claps her hands.) Dance! Dance! (She runs to the pianola.) Who has twopence?\" She gets two pennies from Lynch, drops them in the slot of the mechanical piano, and it \"plays in waltz time the prelude of My Girl's a Yorkshire Girl\" while Stephen waltzes Zoe around the room. Soon the pianola itself is singing the words of the song, joined by Zoe.\n Boylan's Yorkshire girl, of course, is Molly, and the novel raises but does not answer the question, To whom exactly does this \"Rose\" belong?"

    "note": " The songlike lines that Bloom spouts about his daughter,\n O, Milly Bloom, you are my darling,\n You are my lookingglass from night to morning.\n I'd rather have you without a farthing\n Than Katey Keogh with her ass and garden,\n are in fact based on an Irish ballad, and it seems likely that he used to sing them to Milly as a child. But Joyce received similar lines on a Valentine's Day card, in a prank played by a childhood playmate's father. That context heightens the sense of triangulated desire created by Bloom thinking of the song as he reads Milly's letter about meeting a \"young student.\"",
    "expandedNote": " In a book called Legends and Stories of Ireland (Philadelphia, 1835), Samuel Lover reproduces a song with a similar quatrain:\n Oh Thady Brady you are my darlin,\n You are my looking-glass from night till morning\n I love you better without one fardin\n Than Brian Gallagher wid house and garden.\n When the Joyces lived in Bray, James frequently played with a neighbor girl of his age named Eileen, the daughter of the Protestant chemist James Vance. Ellmann notes that Eileen Vance was pretty, \"and the two fathers often spoke half-seriously of uniting their first-born. Dante Conway warned James that if he played with Eileen he would certainly go to hell, and he duly informed Eileen of his destination but did not cease to merit it\" (26). One Valentine's Day, the young Joyce received a card with the following lines, supposedly from Eileen but actually written by her father:\n O Jimmie Joyce you are my darling\n You are my looking glass from night till morning\n I'd rather have you without one farthing\n Than Harry Newall and his ass and garden.\n \"Harry Newall,\" Ellmann notes, \"was an old and disquieting cripple who drove his cart around Bray, so the compliment was not so extravagant as it first appeared\" (31). May Joyce possibly intercepted the card, but James did see it, and \"Eileen, hearing of the trick that had been played on her, became shy with her playmate and for years blushed at the sound of his name. He in turn faithfully kept the verse in mind and put it into Ulysses\" (31-32). \n The circumstances in which Joyce became aware of the quatrain—a father involving himself in his young daughter's romantic life—chime very closely with the uses to which he put it in Calypso. Reading Milly's letter with its mention of Alec Bannon, Bloom has thought in the preceding paragraph of the teacup that Milly gave him as a \"birthday gift. Only five she was then. No, wait: four.\" Like Vance posting a valentine for his daughter, he remembers \"Putting pieces of folded brown paper in the letterbox for her.\" Papli's little \"darling\" is now of an age to choose other men—in the following paragraph Bloom thinks of \"Sex breaking out\" in her—but the song affirms his continuing role as her first lover. It is the first of several moments in Calypso when Bloom indulges the same kind of regretful erotic revery toward both wife and daughter."

    "note": " In Telemachus Haines leaves the tower first, followed by Mulligan, who calls behind him, “Come out, Kinch. You have eaten all we left, I suppose.” The remark implies that Stephen has hungrily finished off the leavings on Mulligan’s and Haines’ plates, and that doing so is somehow ill-mannered. This exchange does not reflect well on the moneyed and supercilious Mulligan, but it also seems to show Joyce reflecting on the dismal figure he cut when he was 22.",
    "expandedNote": " In Scylla and Charybdis Stephen recalls Mulligan’s complaint verbatim, thinking in Shakespearean idiom of the offense that was laid to his charge: “Come on, Kinch. You have eaten all we left. Ay. I will serve you your orts and offals.” Eating food bought by Mulligan (a fact established here, long after the breakfast) contributes to Stephen's feeling that he has been usurped, a Telemachus who eats in his own palace only by the sufferance of the suitors. But his resentment\n It is hard to fault Stephen for being hungry and polishing off the scraps that others have left on the table. But the information about his eating habits seems to flatly contradict what he says in Eumaeus, when Bloom solicitously asks, “At what o’clock did you dine?” “Some time yesterday,” replies Stephen. Bloom is astonished until it occurs to him that “it was already tomorrow Friday. Ah, you mean it’s after twelve!” Stephen corrects himself: “The day before yesterday.” Unless both men understand “dine” to refer to something more substantial than breakfast, it seems that Stephen is exaggerating his fast, possibly to solicit sympathy, and certainly to construct a heroic personal mythology of self-abnegation. Joyce represents in Stephen his own self-pitying hunger during his bohemian days in Paris, with Bloom occupying the role played in life by Mary Murray Joyce."

    "note": " In Telemachus Stephen says to Mulligan, \"You saved men from drowning. I'm not a hero, however.\" In Eumaeus Bloom thinks of Mulligan's \"rescue of that man from certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid at Skerries, or Malahide was it?\" Drawing on a real-life difference between Joyce and Oliver Gogarty, the novel returns repeatedly to the theme of saving another life, beginning with Stephen's meditations in Proteus on whether he could ever be capable of such a thing: \"He saved men from drowning and you shake at a cur's yelping. . . . Would you do what he did? A boat would be near, a lifebuoy. Natürlich, put there for you. Would you or would you not?\"",
    "expandedNote": " Gogarty did in fact save men from drowning, snatching people from the Liffey at least four times between 1898 and 1901, and his aquatic heroism outlived his twenties. In November 1922, the commander of an IRA faction that opposed the Treaty between Ireland and Great Britain authorized the killing of Irish Free State Senators, of whom Gogarty was one. Two months later he was kidnapped by IRA soldiers and held in a house near Chapelizod. Aware that he might soon be executed, he feigned diarrhea, was led out into the garden, broke free, jumped into the Liffey, and swam to freedom in Phoenix Park. Ulick O’Connor's authorized, and valuable, biography of Gogarty details these events beginning on p. 194.\n Ulysses continues to follow the thread of aquatic heroism, but subsequent instances are tinged with sardonic irony. In Hades we learn that the son of Reuben J. Dodd jumped into the Liffey, probably in an attempt at suicide, and was hooked out by a boatman. Dodd rewarded the rescuer “like a hero,” with the un-princely sum of a florin (two shillings). Hearing the story, Simon Dedalus remarks “drily” that it was “One and eightpence too much.” \n In Wandering Rocks Lenehan alludes to the story of Tom Rochford going down into a sewer to rescue a man overcome by gas. “’He’s a hero,’ he said simply. . . . ‘The act of a hero.’” In this instance, however, life complicates the simplicity of art. Robert Martin Adams describes how twelve men in succession went down the manhole, one after another becoming overcome by the methane and requiring a new rescuer to enter the fray (Surface and Symbol, 92-93). Tom Rochford was merely the third in this series of comically futile heroic actors, but Joyce knew and liked Rochford and decided to elevate his importance. \n In Circe, the importance is inflated to absurd proportions, as Rochford, Christ-like, jumps in to save the dead (Paddy Dignam) rather than the dying. Paddy Dignam, who has become a dog, worms his way down through a hole in the ground, followed by “an obese grandfather rat” like the tomb-diving one that Bloom sees in Hades. Dignam’s voice is heard “baying under ground.” Tom Rochford, following close behind, pauses to orate: “(A hand to his breastbone, bows) Reuben J. A florin I find him. (He fixes the manhole with a resolute stare) My turn now on. Follow me up to Carlow. (He executes a daredevil salmon leap in the air and is engulfed in the coalhole. . . .)”"

    "note": " Thinking of religion and “free thought,” Haines speaks some very British words: \"I should think you are able to free yourself. You are your own master, it seems to me.\" He no doubt intends something like the stirring conclusion to William Ernest Henley's Invictus: “I am the master of my fate: / I am the captain of my soul.” The rational, secular, rightthinking individual should be able to take charge of his life and purge his mind of claptrap like \"that idea of a personal God.\" Ironically, though, the conjunction of freedom and self-mastery in Haines' words also evokes the doctrines of Catholicism, as embodied in another passage of The Divine Comedy.",
    "expandedNote": " In Purgatorio 27, having entered the Earthly Paradise, Virgil tells Dante that all his arduous instruction and discipline has come to its end. He has brought the pilgrim to this point “with intellect and will skill.” Now Dante may follow his own pleasure:\n Don’t wait any more for my word or signal;\n Free, upright, and sound is your will,\n And you would do wrong not to do as it counsels:\n Therefore I crown and miter you over yourself.\n (27.139-42, my trans.) \n Dante has freed himself from sin and can reliably guide his own actions. All the souls climbing the mountain of Purgatory do this. Their exit from the final circle and return to the garden of Eden signifies the perfection of their corrupted wills—an ethical reconstitution that is a prerequisite for the intellectual contemplation of Paradise. They are liberated from sin, freed from the bondage of earth’s gravity, able to rise to the vision of God.\n If Stephen hears echoes of Catholic doctrine in Haines’ words—and he probably does, given the fact that he has just been quoting from Dante himself—he must do so with a host of ironic reflections. The freedom promised by the Catholic Church means simply the ability to say Yes or No to God, and saying Yes means surrendering one’s will wholly to the divine will (as Dante’s Paradiso makes clear). Furthermore, freeing oneself from this total subjection, once it is in place, is much more difficult for an Irish Catholic than for someone nurtured by the tepid bosom of English Protestantism. Stephen is “a horrible example of free thought” because he lives every day tortured by his apostasy, crushed by the guilt he associates with his mother, trembling in fear before the God he disbelieves in. \n The Dantean allusion, then, seems to undermine Haines' contention that \"You are your own master,\" and Stephen responds by saying, \"I am the servant of two masters . . . The imperial British state . . . And the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church.\" Nonetheless, Dante's words do proclaim freedom from precisely these two masters, State and Church: that is the meaning of \"Therefore I crown and miter you over yourself.\" So Haines is ultimately giving Stephen good advice, and Stephen is trying to do something like what Haines recommends when, in Circe, he \"taps his brow\" and says, \"in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.\""
