        communion, shook a drop or two (are they in water?) off it and put it
        neatly into her mouth. Her hat and head sank.  Then the next one: a small old woman. The priest bent down

        The priest was rinsing out the chalice: then he tossed off the dregs

        Mr Bloom looked back towards the choir. Not going to be any music. Pity.
        Who has the organ here I wonder? Old Glynn he knew how to make that
        instrument talk, the <i>vibrato</i>: fifty pounds a year they say he had in
        Gardiner street. Molly was in fine voice that day, the <i>Stabat Mater</i>
        of Rossini. Father Bernard Vaughan's sermon first. Christ or Pilate?
        Christ, but don't keep us all night over it. Music they wanted.
        Footdrill stopped. Could hear a pin drop. I told her to pitch her voice
        against that corner. I could feel the thrill in the air, the full, the

        Some of that old sacred music is splendid. Mercadante: seven last words.
        Mozart's twelfth mass: the <i>Gloria</i> in that. Those old popes were keen on music,
        on art and statues and pictures of all kinds. Palestrina for example
        too. They had a gay old time while it lasted. Healthy too, chanting,
        regular hours, then brew liqueurs. Benedictine. Green Chartreuse. Still,
