        —{" "}Yes, sir. And he said: <i>Another victory like that and we are done
        for.</i>

      <p>
        That phrase the world had remembered. A dull ease of the mind. From
        a hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers,
        leaned upon his spear. Any general to any officers. They lend ear.

      <p>
        A bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrong's satchel. He curled them
        between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly. Crumbs adhered to
        the tissue of his lips. A sweetened boy's breath. Welloff people, proud
        that their eldest son was <Annotation annotationId="010058bloodyswindle">in the navy</Annotation>. <Annotation annotationId="020004vicoroad">Vico road, Dalkey</Annotation>.

        —{" "}Pyrrhus, sir? Pyrrhus, a pier.
      </p>
      <p>
        All laughed. Mirthless high malicious laughter. Armstrong looked round 
        <span data-edition="ed1922" data-page="24"></span>
        at his classmates, silly glee in profile. In a moment they will laugh
        more loudly, aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay.
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boy's shoulder with the book,
        what is a pier.

      <p>
        Some laughed again: mirthless but with meaning. Two in the back bench
        whispered. Yes. They knew: had never learned <span data-edition="ed1961" data-page="24"></span>nor ever been <span data-edition="ed1986" data-page="20"> </span>innocent.
        All. With envy he watched their faces: Edith, Ethel, Gerty, Lily. Their
        likes: their breaths, too, sweetened with tea and jam, their bracelets
        tittering in the struggle.

        A swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork
        of his satchel. He recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text:

        They bundled their books away, pencils clacking, pages rustling.
        <span data-edition="ed1932" data-page="24"></span>Crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels, all gabbling
        gaily:

      <p>

        —{" "}Again, sir. We didn't hear.

        Their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated. After a silence
        Cochrane said:

      <p>
        —{" "}What is it, sir? We give it up.
      </p>

        echoed dismay.

        A stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called:

        —{" "}Hockey!

      <p>
        They broke asunder, sidling out of their benches, leaping them. Quickly
        they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and
        clamour of their boots and tongues.

      <p>
        Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly, showing an open
        copybook. His tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness
        and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading. On his
        cheek, dull and bloodless, a soft stain of ink lay, dateshaped, recent
        and damp as a snail's bed.
      </p>
      <p>
        He held out his copybook. The word <i>Sums</i> was written on the headline.
        Beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with
        blind loops and a blot. Cyril Sargent: his name and seal.

        Ugly and futile: lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink, a snail's

        listened, scraped up the earth, listened, scraped and scraped.

        He stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy
        field where sharp voices were in strife. They were sorted in teams and
        Mr Deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet. When
        he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to him. He
        turned his angry white moustache.

        —{" "}I will try, Stephen said, and let you know tomorrow. I know two
        editors slightly.
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}That will do, Mr Deasy said briskly. I wrote last night to Mr Field,
        M.P. There is a meeting of the cattletraders' association today at <Annotation annotationId="020066cityarms">the
        City Arms hotel.</Annotation> I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting. You
        see if you can get it into your two papers. What are they?
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "} <Annotation annotationId="020064telegraph"><i>The Evening Telegraph</i></Annotation>...
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}That will do, Mr Deasy said. There is no time to lose. Now I have to
        answer that letter from my cousin.
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}Good morning, sir, Stephen said, putting the sheets in his pocket.
        Thank you.
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}Not at all, Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk. I
        like to break a lance with you, old as I am.
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}Good morning, sir, Stephen said again, bowing to his bent back.
      </p>
      <p>
        He went out by the open porch and <Annotation annotationId="020072gravelpath">down the gravel path under the trees,
        hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield.
        The lions couchant on the pillars</Annotation> as he <span data-edition="ed1961" data-page="35"></span>passed out through the gate:
        toothless
        <span data-edition="ed1922" data-page="35"></span>
        terrors. Still I will help him in his fight. Mulligan will dub
        me a new name: <Annotation annotationId="020065bullockbefriending">the bullockbefriending bard</Annotation>.
      </p>
      <span data-edition="ed1986" data-page="29"> </span>
      <p>
        —{" "}Mr Dedalus!
      </p>
      <span data-edition="ed1939" data-page="28"> </span>
      <p>
        Running after me. No more letters, I hope.
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}Just one moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}Yes, sir, Stephen said, turning back at the gate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr Deasy halted, breathing hard and swallowing his breath.
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}I just wanted to say, he said. Ireland, they say, has the honour of
        being <Annotation annotationId="020068letthemin">the only country which never persecuted the jews.</Annotation> Do you know
        that? No. And do you know why?
      </p>
      <p>
        He frowned sternly on the bright air.
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}Why, sir? Stephen asked, beginning to smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}Because <Annotation annotationId="020068letthemin">she never let them in</Annotation>, Mr Deasy said solemnly.<span data-edition="ed1932" data-page="33"></span>
      </p>
      <p>A coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a
        rattling chain of phlegm. He turned back quickly, coughing, laughing,
        his lifted arms waving to the air. 
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}She never let them in, he cried again through his laughter as he
        stamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path. That's why.
      </p>
      <p>
        On his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung
        spangles, dancing coins.
