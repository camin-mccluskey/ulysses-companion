        That phrase the world had remembered. A dull ease of the mind. From

        A bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrong's satchel. He curled them
        between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly. Crumbs adhered to
        the tissue of his lips. A sweetened boy's breath. Welloff people, proud
        that their eldest son was <Annotation annotationId="010058bloodyswindle" annotationSelect={() => openNote("010058bloodyswindle")} activeAnnotationId={currentNoteId}>in the navy</Annotation>. <Annotation annotationId="020004vicoroad" annotationSelect={() => openNote("020004vicoroad")} activeAnnotationId={currentNoteId}>Vico road, Dalkey</Annotation>.

        <span data-edition="ed1922" data-page="24"></span>
        at his classmates, silly glee in profile. In a moment they will laugh
        more loudly, aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay.

        —{" "}Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boy's shoulder with the book,

        Some laughed again: mirthless but with meaning. Two in the back bench

        All. With envy he watched their faces: Edith, Ethel, Gerty, Lily. Their

        A swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork

        —{" "}What is it, sir? We give it up.

        A stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called:

        They broke asunder, sidling out of their benches, leaping them. Quickly

        clamour of their boots and tongues.

        Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly, showing an open
        copybook. His tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness
        and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading. On his
        cheek, dull and bloodless, a soft stain of ink lay, dateshaped, recent
        and damp as a snail's bed.
      </p>
      <p>
        He held out his copybook. The word <i>Sums</i> was written on the headline.
        Beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with
        blind loops and a blot. Cyril Sargent: his name and seal.

        Ugly and futile: lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink, a snail's

        of rapine in his fur, with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth,
        listened, scraped up the earth, listened, scraped and scraped.

        Mr Deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet. When
        he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to him. He
        turned his angry white moustache.
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}What is it now? he cried continually without listening.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        And as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man's voice
        cried sternly:
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}What is the matter? What is it now?
      </p>
      <p>
        Their sharp voices cried about him on all sides: their many forms closed
        round him, the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed head.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded leather
        of its chairs. As on the first day he bargained with me here.

        A hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor. Blowing out his
        rare moustache Mr Deasy halted at the table.

      <p>
        —{" "}First, our little financial settlement, he said.

        He brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong. It
