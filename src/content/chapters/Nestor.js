        —{" "}Yes, sir. And he said: <i>Another victory like that and we are done

        That phrase the world had remembered. A dull ease of the mind. From
        a hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers,
        leaned upon his spear. Any general to any officers. They lend ear.

      <p>
        A bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrong's satchel. He curled them
        between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly. Crumbs adhered to
        the tissue of his lips. A sweetened boy's breath. Welloff people, proud
        that their eldest son was <button className="bg-gray-300 bg-center bg-cover hover:bg-green-300" onClick={() => openNote("010058bloodyswindle")}>in the navy</button>. <button className="bg-gray-300 bg-center bg-cover hover:bg-green-300" onClick={() => openNote("020004vicoroad")}>Vico road, Dalkey</button>.

        —{" "}Pyrrhus, sir? Pyrrhus, a pier.

        All laughed. Mirthless high malicious laughter. Armstrong looked round 
        <span data-edition="ed1922" data-page="24"></span>
        at his classmates, silly glee in profile. In a moment they will laugh
        more loudly, aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay.
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boy's shoulder with the book,

        Some laughed again: mirthless but with meaning. Two in the back bench

        All. With envy he watched their faces: Edith, Ethel, Gerty, Lily. Their
        likes: their breaths, too, sweetened with tea and jam, their bracelets
        tittering in the struggle.

      <p>
        A swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork
        of his satchel. He recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text:

        Aristotle's phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated
        out into the studious silence of <button className="bg-gray-300 bg-center bg-cover hover:bg-green-300" onClick={() => openNote("020011saintgenevieve")}>the library of Saint Genevieve</button> where he

        His hand turned the page over. He leaned back and went on again, having

        They bundled their books away, pencils clacking, pages rustling.
        <span data-edition="ed1932" data-page="24"></span>Crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels, all gabbling

      <p>
        —{" "}Again, sir. We didn't hear.

      <p>
        Their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated. After a silence
        Cochrane said:

      <p>
        —{" "}What is it, sir? We give it up.
      </p>

        He stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries
        echoed dismay.
      </p>
      <p>
        A stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called:
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}Hockey!

      <p>
        They broke asunder, sidling out of their benches, leaping them. Quickly
        they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and
        clamour of their boots and tongues.

      <span data-edition="ed1986" data-page="22"> </span>
      <p>
        Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly, showing an open
        copybook. His tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness
        and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading. On his
        cheek, dull and bloodless, a soft stain of ink lay, dateshaped, recent
        and damp as a snail's bed.
      </p>
      <p>
        He held out his copybook. The word <i>Sums</i> was written on the headline.
        Beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with
        blind loops and a blot. Cyril Sargent: his name and seal.

        Ugly and futile: lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink, a snail's
        bed. Yet someone had loved him, borne him in her arms and in her heart.
        But for her the race of the world would have <button className="bg-gray-300 bg-center bg-cover hover:bg-green-300" onClick={() => openNote("020053squashedsnail")}>trampled him underfoot, a squashed boneless snail</button>.

        She was no more: the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the fire,
        an odour of <button className="bg-gray-300 bg-center bg-cover hover:bg-green-300" onClick={() => openNote("010045waxandrosewood")}>rosewood and wetted ashes</button>. She <span data-edition="ed1961" data-page="27"></span>had saved him from being
        trampled underfoot and had gone, scarcely having been. A poor soul
        gone to heaven: and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox, red reek
        of rapine in his fur, with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth,
        listened, scraped up the earth, listened, scraped and scraped.
      </p>

      <p>
        —{" "}Run on, Stephen said. Mr Deasy is calling you.
      </p>
      <p>
        He stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy
        field where sharp voices were in strife. They were sorted in teams and
        Mr Deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet. When
        he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to him. He
        turned his angry white moustache.
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}What is it now? he cried continually without listening.
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side, sir, Stephen said.

      <p>

        order here.
      </p>
      <p>
        And as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man's voice
        cried sternly:
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}What is the matter? What is it now?
      </p>
      <p>
        Their sharp voices cried about him on all sides: their many forms closed
        round him, the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed head.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded leather
        of its chairs. As on the first day he bargained with me here.

      <p>
        A hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor. Blowing out his
        rare moustache Mr Deasy halted at the table.
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}First, our little financial settlement, he said.
      </p>
      <p>
        He brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong. It
        slapped open and he took from it two notes, one of joined halves, and
        laid them carefully on the table.

        —{" "}Thank you, sir, Stephen said, gathering the money together with shy
        haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers.

      <p>
        —{" "}No thanks at all, Mr Deasy said. You have earned it.

        Stephen's hand, free again, went back to the hollow shells. Symbols too
        of beauty and of power. A lump in my pocket: symbols soiled by greed and
        misery.

        He raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke.
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}Mark my words, Mr Dedalus, he said. <button className="bg-gray-300 bg-center bg-cover hover:bg-green-300" onClick={() => openNote("010122germanjews")}>England is in the hands of the

      </p>
      <p>
        He stepped swiftly off, his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a
        broad sunbeam. He faced about and back again.
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}Dying, he said, if not dead by now.

        His eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which
        he halted.

        prices on their gemmed fingers. Gabble of geese. They swarmed loud,
        uncouth about the temple, their heads thickplotting under maladroit silk
        <span data-edition="ed1932" data-page="31"></span>hats. Not theirs: these clothes, this speech, these gestures. Their full
        slow eyes belied the words, the gestures eager and unoffending, but
        knew the rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was vain. Vain
        patience to heap and hoard. Time surely would scatter all. A hoard
        heaped by the roadside: plundered and passing on. Their eyes knew their
        years of wandering and, patient, knew the dishonours of their flesh.

      <p>
        —{" "}What do you mean? Mr Deasy asked.
      </p>
      <p>
        He came forward a pace and stood by the table. His underjaw fell
        sideways open uncertainly. Is this old wisdom? He waits to hear from me.

        —{" "}History, Stephen said, is <button className="bg-gray-300 bg-center bg-cover hover:bg-green-300" onClick={() => openNote("020063niare")}>a niare from which I am trying to awake.</button>
      </p>
      <p>
        From the playfield the boys raised a shout. A whirring whistle: goal.
        What if that niare gave you a back kick?
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}The ways of the Creator are not our ways, Mr Deasy said. <button className="bg-gray-300 bg-center bg-cover hover:bg-green-300" onClick={() => openNote("020067onegreatgoal")}>All human

      <p>
        —{" "}That is God.

      <p>
        Mr Deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked
        between his fingers. Looking up again he set them free.

        —{" "}Well, sir, he began...
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}I foresee, Mr Deasy said, that you will not remain here very long
        at this work. You were not born to be a teacher, I think. Perhaps I am
        wrong.

        —{" "}A learner rather, Stephen said.

      <p>
        And here what will you learn more?

      <p>
        Mr Deasy shook his head.
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}Who knows? he said. To learn one must be humble. But life is the great
        teacher.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stephen rustled the sheets again.
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}As regards these, he began.
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}Yes, Mr Deasy said. You have two copies there. If you can have them
        published at once.

      <p>
        —{" "}I will try, Stephen said, and let you know tomorrow. I know two
        editors slightly.
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}That will do, Mr Deasy said briskly. I wrote last night to Mr Field,
        M.P. There is a meeting of the cattletraders' association today at <button className="bg-gray-300 bg-center bg-cover hover:bg-green-300" onClick={() => openNote("020066cityarms")}>the

        —{" "}That will do, Mr Deasy said. There is no time to lose. Now I have to
        answer that letter from my cousin.

      <p>
        —{" "}Good morning, sir, Stephen said, putting the sheets in his pocket.
        Thank you.
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}Not at all, Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk. I
        like to break a lance with you, old as I am.

        —{" "}Yes, sir, Stephen said, turning back at the gate.

        Mr Deasy halted, breathing hard and swallowing his breath.

      <p>
        —{" "}I just wanted to say, he said. Ireland, they say, has the honour of
        being <button className="bg-gray-300 bg-center bg-cover hover:bg-green-300" onClick={() => openNote("020068letthemin")}>the only country which never persecuted the jews.</button> Do you know
        that? No. And do you know why?

      <p>
        He frowned sternly on the bright air.
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}Why, sir? Stephen asked, beginning to smile.

      </p>
      <p>A coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a
        rattling chain of phlegm. He turned back quickly, coughing, laughing,
        his lifted arms waving to the air. 
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}She never let them in, he cried again through his laughter as he
        stamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path. That's why.

        On his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung
        spangles, dancing coins.
