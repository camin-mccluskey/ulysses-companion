      have the two of them under my nose all the time like that slut that Mary
      we had in Ontario terrace padding out her false bottom to excite him bad
      enough to get the smell of those painted women off him once or twice
      I had a suspicion by getting him to come near me when I found the
      long hair on his coat without that one when I went into the kitchen
      pretending he was drinking water 1 woman is not enough for them it was
      all his fault of course ruining servants then proposing that she could
      eat at our table on Christmas day if you please O no thank you not in my
      house stealing my potatoes and the oysters 2/6 per doz going out to see
      her aunt if you please common robbery so it was but I was sure he had
      something on with that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he

      <span data-edition="ed1922" data-page="691"></span>
      of oysters but I told her what I thought of her suggesting me to go out to
      be alone with her I wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters I

      I gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house I couldnt even
      touch him if I thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar and sloven
      like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the place in
      the W C too because she knew she was too well off yes because he couldnt
      possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere and the last
      time he came on my bottom when was it the night Boylan gave my hand a
      great squeeze going along by the Tolka in my hand there steals another
      I just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb to squeeze back
      singing the young May moon shes beaming love <span data-edition="ed1986" data-page="609"></span>because he has an idea

        a wonderful feeling there so tender all the time how did we finish it
        off yes O yes I pulled him off into my handkerchief pretending not to

        for the burglars benefit there isnt much to steal indeed the Lord knows

        if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what I never had thats
        why I suppose hes running wild now out at night away from his books
        and studies and not living at home on account of the usual rowy house I
        suppose well its a poor case that those that have a fine son like that
        theyre not satisfied and I none was he not able to make one it wasnt my

        upside down the two ways I always knew wed go away in the end I can
        tell him the Spanish and he tell me the Italian then hell see Im not
        so ignorant what a pity he didnt stay Im sure the poor fellow was dead
        tired and wanted a good sleep badly I could have brought him in his
        breakfast in bed with a bit of toast so long as I didnt do it on
        the knife for bad luck or if the woman was going her rounds with the
        watercress and something nice and tasty there are a few olives in the
        kitchen he might like I never could bear the look of them in Abrines
        I could do the criada the room looks all right since I changed it the
        other way you see something was telling me all the time Id have to
        introduce myself not knowing me from Adam very funny wouldnt it Im his
        wife or pretend we were in Spain with him half awake without a Gods
        notion where he is dos huevos estrellados señor Lord the cracked things
        come into my head sometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed with us
        why not theres the room upstairs empty and Millys bed in the back room
        he could do his writing and studies 
        <span data-edition="ed1939" data-page="549"> </span>
        at the table in there for all the
        scribbling he does at it and if he wants to read in bed in the morning
        like me as hes making the breakfast for 1 he can make it for 2 Im sure
        Im not going to take in lodgers off the street for him if he takes
        a gesabo of a house <span data-edition="ed1961" data-page="779"></span>like this Id love to have a long talk with an
        intelligent welleducated person Id have to get a nice pair of red
        slippers like those Turks with the fez used to sell or yellow and a
        nice semitransparent morning gown that I badly want or a peachblossom
        dressing jacket like the one long ago in Walpoles only 8/6 or 18/6 Ill
        just give him one more chance Ill get up early in the morning Im sick of
        Cohens old bed in any case I might go over to the markets to see all
        the vegetables and cabbages and tomatoes and carrots and all kinds of
        splendid fruits all coming in lovely and fresh who knows whod be the 1st
        man Id meet <span data-edition="ed1932" data-page="679"></span>theyre out looking for it in the morning Mamy Dillon used

        wants to kiss my bottom Ill drag open my drawers and bulge it right out
        in his face as large as life he can stick his tongue 7 miles up my hole
        as hes there my brown part then Ill tell him I want £1 or perhaps 30/-
        Ill tell him I want to buy underclothes then if he gives me that well he
        wont be too bad I dont want to soak it all out of him like other women
        do I could often have written out a fine cheque for myself and write his
        name on it for a couple of pounds a few times he forgot to lock it up
        besides he wont spend it Ill let him do it off on me behind provided <span data-edition="ed1961" data-page="780"></span>he
        doesnt smear all my good drawers O I suppose that cant be helped Ill do

        that he cant keep a thing back I know every turn in him Ill tighten my
        bottom well and let out a few smutty words smellrump or lick my shit or
        the first mad thing comes into my head then Ill suggest about yes O wait
        now sonny my turn is coming Ill be quite gay and friendly over it O

        which to laugh or cry were such a mixture of plum and apple no Ill have
        to wear the old things so much the better itll be more pointed hell
        never know whether he did it or not there thats good enough for you
        any old thing at all then Ill wipe him off me just like a business his
        omission then Ill go out Ill have him eying up at the ceiling where is
        she <span data-edition="ed1932" data-page="680"></span>gone now make him want me thats the only way a quarter after what an

        the sea and the waves rushing then the beautiful country with the fields
        of oats and wheat and all kinds of things <span data-edition="ed1986" data-page="642"></span>and all the fine cattle going
        about that would do your heart good to see rivers and lakes and flowers

        that made it all who ah that they dont know neither do I so there you
