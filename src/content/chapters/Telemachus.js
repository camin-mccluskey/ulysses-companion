      —{" "}<Annotation annotationId="010006introibo"><i>Introibo ad altare Dei</i></Annotation>.

      Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called up coarsely:

      —{" "}Come up, <Annotation annotationId="010007kinch">Kinch</Annotation>! Come up, you fearful <Annotation annotationId="010008jesuit">jesuit</Annotation>.

      and blessed gravely thrice the <Annotation annotationId="010009tower">tower</Annotation>, the surrounding country and the <Annotation annotationId="010010mountains">awaking mountains</Annotation>. Then, catching sight of <Annotation annotationId="010011stephendedalus">Stephen Dedalus</Annotation>, he bent
      towards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat
      and shaking his head. Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned
      his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking
      gurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light
      <Annotation annotationId="010005ungirdled">untonsured</Annotation> hair, grained and hued like pale oak.

    <p>
      Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the
      bowl smartly.

    <p>
      —{" "}<Annotation annotationId="010013barracks">Back to barracks</Annotation>! he said sternly.

    <p>
      He peered sideways up and gave a long low whistle of call, then paused
      awhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and there
      with gold points. <Annotation annotationId="010017chrysostomos">Chrysostomos</Annotation>. <Annotation annotationId="010016shrillwhistles">Two strong shrill whistles answered</Annotation>

      He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the <Annotation annotationId="010002stairhead">parapet</Annotation>,
      laughing to himself. Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily
      halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as he propped his mirror on the <span data-edition="ed1961" data-page="3"> </span>parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and
      lathered cheeks and neck.

      Buck Mulligan's gay voice went on.

    <p>
      Ceasing, he began to shave with care.

      Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder.

    <p>
      —{" "}God, isn't he dreadful? he said frankly. A ponderous <Annotation annotationId="010024stranger">Saxon</Annotation>. He thinks

      Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade. He hopped down
      from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily.

    <p>
      Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a
      dirty crumpled handkerchief. Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly.
      Then, gazing over the handkerchief, he said:

    <p>
      He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over <Annotation annotationId="010123dublinbay">Dublin bay</Annotation>, his fair

      Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet. Leaning on it he looked
      down on the water and on the <Annotation annotationId="010036mailboat">mailboat</Annotation> clearing the <Annotation annotationId="010037harbourmouth">harbourmouth of

    <p>
      He turned abruptly <Annotation annotationId="010038greateyes">his great searching eyes</Annotation> from the sea to Stephen's
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      —{" "}The aunt thinks <Annotation annotationId="010042prayforme">you killed your mother</Annotation>, he said. That's why she won't

    <p>
      —{" "}But a lovely <Annotation annotationId="010043mummer">mummer</Annotation>! he murmured to himself. Kinch, the loveliest

    <p>
      He shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palm against
      his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat-sleeve.
      Pain, that was not yet the <Annotation annotationId="010044painfretted">pain of love</Annotation>, fretted his heart. <Annotation annotationId="010045waxandrosewood">Silently, in

      He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the

      Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its

      He swept the mirror a half circle in the air <Annotation annotationId="010021malachi">to flash the tidings abroad</Annotation>
      in sunlight now radiant on the sea. His curling shaven lips laughed and
      the edges of his white glittering teeth. Laughter seized all his strong

      —{" "}Look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard!

      Because you have the cursed <Annotation annotationId="010008jesuit">jesuit</Annotation> strain in you, only it's injected the

      He had spoken himself into boldness. Stephen, shielding the <Annotation annotationId="010059pulsesbeating">gaping
      wounds</Annotation> which the words had left in his heart, said very coldly:
    </p>

      He walked off quickly round the parapet. Stephen stood at <Annotation annotationId="010009tower">his post</Annotation>,

    <p>
      —{" "}I'm coming, Buck Mulligan answered.

      milkcan on her forearm and about to go.

    <p>
      Haines said to her:
    </p>
    <p>
      —{" "}Have you your bill? We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn't we?
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephen filled again the three cups.
    </p>
    <p>
      —{" "}Bill, sir? she said, halting. Well, <Annotation annotationId="010019money">it's seven mornings a pint at

    </p>
    <p>
      Buck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly
      buttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search his
      trouser pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      —{" "}Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the
      thick rich milk. Buck Mulligan brought up a <Annotation annotationId="010019money">florin</Annotation>, twisted it round in
      his fingers and cried:

      —{" "}A miracle!

      Then he said to Haines:

      of tone:

    <p>
      —{" "}Wait till you <Annotation annotationId="010139hearhim">hear him on Hamlet</Annotation>, Haines.

      thinking of it when that poor old creature came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      —{" "}Would I make money by it? Stephen asked.

    <p>
      Haines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the <Annotation annotationId="010085towerlivingroom">holdfast of

    <p>
      —{" "}I don't know, I'm sure.

    <p>

    <p>
      —{" "}I blow him out about you, Buck Mulligan said, and then you come along
      with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes.

    <span data-edition="ed1939" data-page="14"> </span>
    <p>
      Buck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      —{" "}From me, Kinch, he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a suddenly changed tone he added:

      Stephen, taking his <Annotation annotationId="010099ashplant">ashplant</Annotation> from its leaningplace, followed them out
      and, as they went <Annotation annotationId="010085towerlivingroom">down the ladder</Annotation>, pulled to the slow iron door and

      At the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked:

    </p>
    <p>

      They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last:

    <p>
      Buck Mulligan slung his towel <Annotation annotationId="010104stole">stolewise</Annotation> round his neck and, bending in

      rather long to tell.

      Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face. He looked
      at them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had
      suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety. He moved
      a doll's head to and fro, <span data-edition="ed1961" data-page="18"> </span>the brims of his <Annotation annotationId="010109panamahat">Panama hat</Annotation> quivering, and

    </p>
    <p>
      He tugged swiftly at Stephen's ashplant in farewell and, running forward
      to a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or
      wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted:

      of whom Mulligan was one, and Arius, warring his life long upon<Annotation annotationId="010119trinity">the
      consubstantiality of the Son with the Father</Annotation>, and Valentine, spurning
      Christ's terrene body, and the subtle African heresiarch Sabellius<span data-edition="ed1986" data-page="17"> </span> who
      held that the Father was Himself His own Son. Words Mulligan had spoken
      a moment since in mockery to the <Annotation annotationId="010024stranger">stranger</Annotation>. Idle mockery. The void
      awaits surely all them that <Annotation annotationId="010120weavewind">weave the wind</Annotation>: a menace, a disarming and a
      worsting from those embattled angels of the church, <Annotation annotationId="010088archangelmichael">Michael's host,</Annotation>

      —{" "}Of course I'm a Britisher, Haines' voice said, and I feel as one. I
      don't want to see my country fall into the hands of <Annotation annotationId="010122germanjews">German jews</Annotation> either.
      That's our national problem, I'm afraid, just now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman, boatman.
    </p>
    <p>
      —{" "}She's making for <Annotation annotationId="010135bullockharbour">Bullock harbour</Annotation>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain.
    </p>
    <p>
      —{" "}There's <Annotation annotationId="010124fivefathoms">five fathoms</Annotation> out there, he said. It'll be swept up that way
      when <Annotation annotationId="010125hightide">the tide comes in about one</Annotation>. It's nine days today.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man that was drowned. A sail veering about the blank bay waiting
      for a swollen bundle to bob up, roll over to the sun a puffy face,
      saltwhite. Here I am.
    </p>
    <p>
      They followed the winding path down to the <Annotation annotationId="010111fortyfoot">creek</Annotation>. Buck Mulligan stood on
      a stone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder.
      A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him, <Annotation annotationId="010147sealshead">moved slowly frogwise
      his green legs in the deep jelly of the water</Annotation>.
    </p>
    <p>
      —{" "}Is the brother with you, Malachi?
    </p>
    <p>
      —{" "}Down in <Annotation annotationId="010126mullingar">Westmeath.</Annotation> With the Bannons.
    </p>
    <p>
      —{" "}Still there? I got a card from Bannon. Says he found a sweet young
      thing down there. <Annotation annotationId="010127photogirl">Photo girl</Annotation> he calls her.
    </p>
    <span data-edition="ed1961" data-page="21"> </span>
    <p>
      —{" "}Snapshot, eh? Brief exposure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots. An elderly man shot up near
      the spur of rock a blowing red face. He scrambled up by the stones,
      water glistening on his pate and on its <Annotation annotationId="010136nimbus">garland of grey hair</Annotation>,<span data-edition="ed1932" data-page="20"> </span>water
      rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black
      sagging loincloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at Haines
      and Stephen, <Annotation annotationId="010057crossed">crossed himself piously</Annotation> with his thumbnail at brow and lips
      and breastbone.
    </p>
    <span data-edition="ed1922" data-page="21"> </span>
    <p>
      —{" "}Seymour's back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur of
      rock. Chucked medicine and <Annotation annotationId="010058bloodyswindle">going in for the army.</Annotation> 
    </p>
    <span data-edition="ed1939" data-page="18"> </span>
    <p>
      —{" "}Ah, go to God! Buck Mulligan said.
    </p>
    <p>
      —{" "}Going over next week to stew. You know that red Carlisle girl, Lily?
    </p>
    <p>
      —{" "}Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      —{" "}Spooning with him last night <Annotation annotationId="010037harbourmouth">on the pier</Annotation>. The father is rotto with
      money.
    </p>
    <p>
      —{" "}Is she <Annotation annotationId="010058bloodyswindle">up the pole?</Annotation>
    </p>
    <p>
      —{" "}Better ask Seymour that.
    </p>
    <p>
      —{" "}Seymour a bleeding officer! Buck Mulligan said.
    </p>
    <span data-edition="ed1986" data-page="18"> </span>
    <p>
      He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, saying
      tritely:
    </p>
    <p>
      —{" "}Redheaded women buck like goats.
    </p>
    <p>
      He broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt.
    </p>
    <p>
      —{" "}<Annotation annotationId="010129ubermensch">My twelfth rib is gone, he cried. I'm the <i>Uebermensch.</i></Annotation> <Annotation annotationId="010130toothless">Toothless
      Kinch</Annotation> and I, the supermen.
    </p>
    <p>
      He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his
      clothes lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      —{" "}Are you going in here, Malachi?
    </p>
    <p>
      —{" "}Yes. Make room in the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached
      <Annotation annotationId="010111fortyfoot">the middle of the creek</Annotation> in two long clean strokes. Haines sat down on a
      stone, smoking.
    </p>
    <p>
      —{" "}Are you not coming in? Buck Mulligan asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      —{" "}Later on, Haines said. Not on my breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephen turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      —{" "}I'm going, Mulligan, he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      —{" "}Give us that key, Kinch, Buck Mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat.
    </p>
    <span data-edition="ed1961" data-page="22"> </span>
    <p>
      Stephen handed him the key. Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped
      clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      —{" "}And <Annotation annotationId="010019money">twopence</Annotation>, he said, for a pint. Throw it there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap. Dressing, undressing. Buck
      Mulligan erect, with joined hands before him, said solemnly:
    </p>
    <span data-edition="ed1932" data-page="21"> </span>

      —{" "}<Annotation annotationId="010129ubermensch">He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord. Thus spake

    <p>
      His plump body plunged.
    </p>
    <p>
      —{" "}We'll see you again, Haines said, turning as Stephen walked up the
      path and smiling at <Annotation annotationId="010132wildirish">wild Irish</Annotation>.

      He walked along the upwardcurving path.

      A voice, sweettoned and sustained, called to him from the sea. Turning
