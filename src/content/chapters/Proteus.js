        off like a bounding hare, ears flung back, chasing the shadow of a

        round it, brother, nosing closer, went round it, sniffling rapidly like
        a dog all over the dead dog's bedraggled fell. Dogskull, dogsniff, eyes

        slunk back in a curve. Doesn't see me. Along by the edge of the mole he

        against it. He trotted forward and, lifting his hindleg, pissed
        quick short at an unsmelt rock. The simple pleasures of the poor. His
