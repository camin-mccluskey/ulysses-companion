        In Inisfail the fair there lies a land, the land of holy Michan. There

        So we turned into Barney Kiernan's and there, sure enough, was the
        citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that
        bloody mangy mongrel, Garryowen, and he waiting for what the sky would
        drop in the way of drink.

        The bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps. Be

      <p>
        —{" "}Pass, friends, says he.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he rubs his hand in his eye and says he:

      <p>
        —{" "}What's your opinion of the times?
      </p>
      <p>

        So begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says:

        —{" "}Foreign wars is the cause of it.

      <p>The figure seated on a large boulder at the

        The widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same tawny hue
        projected, were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous
        obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest. The eyes
        in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the
        dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower. A powerful current of warm breath
        issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth
        while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his
        formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground, the summit of
        the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and
        tremble.

        He wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching
        to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by
        a girdle of plaited straw and rushes. Beneath this he wore trews of

        Terence O'Ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup
        full of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveagh and
        Bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of
        deathless Leda. For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and
        mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour
        juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day
        from their toil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then did you, chivalrous Terence, hand forth, as to the manner born,

        in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon of
        costliest bronze. Thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen
        the image of a queen of regal port, scion of the house of Brunswick,
        Victoria her name, Her Most Excellent Majesty, by grace of God of the
        United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British dominions
        beyond the sea, queen, defender of the faith, Empress of India, even

        In the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by
        tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing
        luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible, the apparition of
        the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge
        of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face. Communication was
        effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery
        and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus.
        Questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he
        stated that he was now on the path of pralaya or return but was still
        submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the
        lower astral levels. In reply to a question as to his first sensations
        in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a
        glass darkly but that those who had <span data-edition="ed1986" data-page="247"> </span>passed over had summit possibilities
        of atmic development opened up to them. Interrogated as to whether life
        there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard
        from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were
        <span data-edition="ed1932" data-page="271"> </span>equipped with every modern home comfort such as talafana, alavatar,
        hatakalda, wataklasat and that the highest adepts were steeped in
        waves of volupcy of the 
        <span data-edition="ed1939" data-page="219"> </span>
        very purest nature. Having requested a quart of
        buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief. Asked if he
        had any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the
        wrong side of Maya to acknowledge the true path for it was reported
        in devanic circles that Mars and Jupiter were out for mischief on the
        eastern angle where the ram has power. It was then queried whether there
        were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was:
        <i>We greet you, friends of earth, who are still in the body. Mind C. K.
        doesn't pile</i> <span data-edition="ed1961" data-page="301"> </span><i>it on.</i> It was ascertained that the reference was to Mr
        Cornelius Kelleher, manager of Messrs H. J. O'Neill's popular
        funeral establishment, a personal friend of the defunct, who had been
        responsible for the carrying out of the interment arrangements. Before
        departing he requested that it should be told to his dear son Patsy that
        the other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the
        commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to Cullen's
        to be soled only as the heels were still good. He stated that this had
        greatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly
        requested that his desire should be made known.
      </p>
      <p>
        Assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was
        intimated that this had given satisfaction.

        He is gone from mortal haunts: O'Dignam, sun of our morning. Fleet was

      </p>
      <span data-edition="ed1932" data-page="273"> </span>
      <p>
        —{" "}And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too, says the citizen.
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe. Here, says he, take them
        to hell out of my sight, Alf. Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you have?
      </p>
      <span data-edition="ed1961" data-page="303"> </span>
      <p>
        So they started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn't and he
        couldn't and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well
        he'd just take a cigar. Gob, he's a prudent member and no mistake.
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe.
      </p>
      <span data-edition="ed1986" data-page="249"> </span>
      <p>
        And Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a
        black border round it.
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}They're all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang
        their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses.
      </p>
      <p>
        And he was telling us there's two fellows waiting below to pull his
        heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they
        chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor. Their
        deadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever
        wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so
        saith the Lord.
      </p>
      <span data-edition="ed1922" data-page="291"> </span>
      <p>
        So they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom
        comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the
        business and the old dog smelling him all the time I'm told those jewies
        does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about I don't
        know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on.
      </p>
      <span data-edition="ed1939" data-page="221"> </span>
      <p>
        —{" "}There's one thing it hasn't a deterrent effect on, says Alf.
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}What's that? says Joe.
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}The poor bugger's tool that's being hanged, says Alf.
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}That so? says Joe.
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}God's truth, says Alf. I heard that from the head warder that was in 
        Kilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible. He told me when
        they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like
        a poker.
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe, as someone said.
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}That can be explained by science, says Bloom. It's only a natural
        phenomenon, don't you see, because on account of the...
      </p>
      <p>
        And then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and
        this phenomenon and the other phenomenon.
      </p>
      <p>
        The distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered
        medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the
        cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord <span data-edition="ed1932" data-page="274"> </span>would,
        according to the best approved <span data-edition="ed1961" data-page="304"> </span>tradition of medical science, be
        calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent
        ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus,
        thereby causing the elastic pores of the <i>corpora cavernosa</i> to rapidly
        dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood
        to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ
        resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty
        a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection <i>in articulo
        mortis per diminutionem capitis.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        So of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and
        he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and
        the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe with
        him about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported for
        the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this, that
        and <span data-edition="ed1986" data-page="250"> </span>the other. Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a new
        dog so he ought. Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round
        the place and scratching his scabs. And round he goes to Bob Doran that
        was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could get. So of
        course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him:
      </p>
      <span data-edition="ed1922" data-page="292"> </span>
      <p>
        —{" "}Give us the paw! Give the paw, doggy! Good old doggy! Give the paw
        here! Give us the paw!
      </p>
      <p>
        Arrah! bloody end to the paw he'd paw and Alf trying to keep him from
        tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking
        all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and
        intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip. Then he starts scraping a few
        bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacobs' tin he told Terry to
        bring. Gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging
        out of him a yard long for more. Near ate the tin and all, hungry bloody
        mongrel.
      </p>
      <p>
        And the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, <Annotation annotationId="120011arbourhill" annotationSelect={() => openNote("120011arbourhill")} activeAnnotationId={currentNoteId}>the
        brothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill</Annotation> and Robert Emmet
        and die for your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and
        she's far from the land. And Bloom, of course, with his <Annotation annotationId="120003intomyeye" annotationSelect={() => openNote("120003intomyeye")} activeAnnotationId={currentNoteId}>knockmedown

        Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the
        lout out for a walk. And one time he <span data-edition="ed1932" data-page="275"> </span>led him the rounds of Dublin and,
        by the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought him home as
        drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of
        alcohol and by herrings, if the three women didn't near roast him, it's
        a queer story, the old one, Bloom's wife and Mrs O'Dowd that kept the
        hotel. Jesus, I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them off chewing
        the fat. And Bloom with his <i>but don't you see?</i> and <i>but on the other
        hand</i>. And sure, more be token, the lout I'm told was in Power's after,
        the blender's, round in Cope street going home footless in a cab five
        times in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the
        bloody establishment. Phenomenon!
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and
        glaring at Bloom.
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}Ay, ay, says Joe.
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}You don't grasp my point, says Bloom. What I mean is...
      </p>
      <p>

        The last farewell was affecting in the extreme. From the belfries far
        and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the
        gloomy 
        <span data-edition="ed1922" data-page="293"> </span>
        precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums
        punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance. The deafening
        <span data-edition="ed1986" data-page="251"> </span>claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up
        the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its
        supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle. A torrential rain
        poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the
        bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the
        lowest computation five hundred thousand persons. A posse of Dublin
        Metropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person
        maintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and
        reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on
        their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from
        the cradle by Speranza's plaintive muse. Special quick excursion trains
        and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our
        country <span data-edition="ed1961" data-page="306"> </span>cousins of whom there were large contingents. Considerable
        amusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L-n-h-n and
        M-ll-g-n who sang <Annotation annotationId="040081boldlarry" annotationSelect={() => openNote("040081boldlarry")} activeAnnotationId={currentNoteId}><i>The Night before Larry was stretched</i></Annotation> in their usual
        mirth-provoking fashion. Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade
        with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody
        who has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity
        will grudge them their hardearned pennies. The children of the Male and
        Female Foundling Hospital who thronged the <span data-edition="ed1932" data-page="276"> </span>windows overlooking the scene
        were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day's entertainment
        and a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the Poor for their
        excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children
        a genuinely instructive treat. The viceregal houseparty which included
        many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by Their Excellencies to the most
        favourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign
        delegation known as the Friends of the Emerald Isle was accommodated
        on a tribune directly opposite. The delegation, present in full force,
        consisted of Commendatore Bacibaci Beninobenone (the semiparalysed
        <i>doyen</i> of the party who had to be assisted to 
        <span data-edition="ed1939" data-page="223"> </span>
        his seat by the aid of a
        powerful steam crane), Monsieur Pierrepaul Petitépatant, the Grandjoker

        Herr Hurhausdirektorpräsident Hans Chuechli-Steuerli,
        Nationalgymnasiummuseumsanatoriumandsuspensoriumsordinaryprivatdocentgeneralhistory-specialprofessordoctor Kriegfried Ueberallgemein. All the
        delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest
        possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which
        they had been called upon to witness. An animated altercation (in which
        all took part) ensued among the F. O. T. E. I. as to whether the eighth
        or the ninth of March was the <span data-edition="ed1986" data-page="252"> </span>correct date of the birth of Ireland's
        patron saint. In the course of the argument cannonballs, scimitars,
        boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots, meatchoppers, umbrellas,
        catapults, <span data-edition="ed1961" data-page="307"> </span>knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pig iron were resorted to
        and blows were freely exchanged. The baby policeman, Constable
        MacFadden, summoned by special courier from Booterstown, quickly
        restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth
        of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending
        parties. The readywitted <Annotation annotationId="040084sizeable" annotationSelect={() => openNote("040084sizeable")} activeAnnotationId={currentNoteId}>ninefooter</Annotation>'s suggestion at once appealed to all
        and was unanimously accepted. Constable MacFadden was heartily
        congratulated by all the F. O. T. E. I., several of whom were bleeding
        profusely. Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricated from
        underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his legal
        adviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles <span data-edition="ed1932" data-page="277"> </span>secreted in his
        thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the
        pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their
        senses. The objects (which included several hundred ladies' and
        gentlemen's gold and silver watches) were promptly restored to their
        rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme.
      </p>
      <p>
        Quietly, unassumingly, Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless
        morning dress and wearing his favourite flower, the <i>Gladiolus
        Cruentus</i>. He announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough
        which so many have tried (unsuccessfully) to imitate{" "}—{" "}short,
        painstaking yet withal so characteristic of the man. The arrival of the
        worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the
        huge concourse, the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in
        their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates
        cheered vociferously in a medley of cries, <i>hoch, banzai, eljen, zivio,
        chinchin, polla kronia, hiphip, vive, Allah</i>, amid which the ringing
        <i>evviva</i> of the delegate of the land of song (a high double F recalling
        those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch Catalani beglamoured
        our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily distinguishable. It was exactly
        seventeen o'clock. The signal for prayer was then promptly given by
        megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared, 
        <span data-edition="ed1922" data-page="295"> </span>
        the commendatore's
        patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the possession of his family
        since the revolution of Rienzi, being removed by his medical adviser
        in attendance, Dr Pippi. The learned prelate who administered the last
        comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when about to pay the death
        penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater, his
        cassock above 
        <span data-edition="ed1939" data-page="224"> </span>
        his hoary head, and offered up to the throne of grace
        fervent prayers of <span data-edition="ed1961" data-page="308"> </span>supplication. Hard by the block stood the grim figure
        of the executioner, his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot
        with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered
        furiously. As he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his
        horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated
        in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the
        admirers of his fell but necessary office. On a handsome mahogany table
        near him were neatly arranged the <span data-edition="ed1986" data-page="253"> </span>quartering knife, the various
        finely tempered disembowelling appliances (specially supplied by the
        worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round and Sons, Sheffield),
        a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum, colon,
        blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two
        commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the
        most precious victim. The housesteward of the amalgamated cats' and
        dogs' home was in attendance <span data-edition="ed1932" data-page="278"> </span>to convey these vessels when replenished
        to that beneficent institution. Quite an excellent repast consisting of
        rashers and eggs, fried steak and onions, done to a nicety, delicious
        hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided
        by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the
        tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced
        the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he,
        with an abnegation rare in these our times, rose nobly to the occasion
        and expressed the dying wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal
        should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and
        indigent roomkeepers' association as a token of his regard and esteem.
        The <i>nec</i> and <i>non plus ultra</i> of emotion were reached when the blushing
        bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders
        and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be
        launched into eternity for her sake. The hero folded her willowy form in
        a loving embrace murmuring fondly <i>Sheila, my own</i>. Encouraged by
        this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various
        suitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb
        permitted her ardour to reach. She swore to him as they mingled the salt
        streams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory, that she
        would never 
        <span data-edition="ed1922" data-page="296"> </span>
        forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his
        lips as if he were but going to a hurling match in Clonturk park. She
        brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood
        together on the banks of <span data-edition="ed1961" data-page="309"> </span>Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the
        innocent pastimes of the young and, oblivious of the dreadful present,
        they both laughed heartily, all the spectators, including the venerable
        pastor, joining in the general merriment. That monster audience simply
        rocked with delight. But anon they were overcome with grief and clasped
        their hands for the last time. A fresh torrent of tears burst from their
        lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people, touched to the inmost
        core, broke into heartrending sobs, not the least affected being the
        aged prebendary himself. Big strong men, officers of the peace and
        genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary, were making frank use of
        their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye
        in that record assemblage. A most romantic incident occurred when a
        handsome young Oxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the fair
        sex, stepped forward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook
        and genealogical tree, solicited the hand of the hapless young lady,
        requesting her to name the day, and was accepted on the spot. Every lady
        in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the 
        <span data-edition="ed1939" data-page="225"> </span>
        occasion
        in the shape of a skull and <span data-edition="ed1986" data-page="254"> </span><span data-edition="ed1932" data-page="279"> </span>crossbones brooch, a timely and generous
        act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the gallant young
        Oxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the most timehonoured names
        in Albion's history) placed on the finger of his blushing <i>fiancée</i> an
        expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a
        fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds. Nay, even the
        stern provostmarshal, lieutenantcolonel Tomkin-Maxwell ffrenchmullan
        Tomlinson, who presided on the sad occasion, he who had blown a
        considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching,
        could not now restrain his natural emotion. With his mailed gauntlet
        he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard, by those privileged
        burghers who happened to be in his immediate <i>entourage,</i> to murmur to
        himself in a faltering undertone:
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}God blimey if she aint a clinker, that there bleeding tart. Blimey it
        makes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause
        I thinks of my old mashtub what's waiting for me down Limehouse way.
      </p>

        So then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and <Annotation annotationId="060033corporation" annotationSelect={() => openNote("060033corporation")} activeAnnotationId={currentNoteId}>the

        talking about the Gaelic league and the

        about the size of it. Gob, he'd let you pour all manner of drink down
        his throat till the Lord would call him before you'd ever see the froth
        of his pint. And one night I went in with a fellow into one of their
        musical evenings, song and dance about she could get up on a truss of
        hay she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow with a Ballyhooly
        blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen
        bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals
        and oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob, flahoolagh
        entertainment, don't be talking. Ireland sober is Ireland free. And
        then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers
        shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of. And one or two
        sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the
        females, hitting below the belt.
      </p>
      <p>
        So howandever, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty
        starts mousing around by Joe and me. I'd train him by kindness, so I
        would, if he was my dog. Give him a rousing fine kick now and again
        where it wouldn't blind him.

        —{" "}No, says I. But he might take my leg for a lamppost.
      </p>
      <p>
        So he calls the old dog over.
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}What's on you, Garry? says he.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the
        old towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera.
        Such growling you never heard as they let off between them. Someone that
        has nothing better to do ought to write a letter <i>pro bono publico</i> to
        the papers <span data-edition="ed1986" data-page="255"> </span>about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that. Growling
        and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the
        hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws.

        All those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the
        lower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not
        missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the
        famous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the <i>sobriquet</i> of
        Garryowen and recently rechristened 
        <span data-edition="ed1939" data-page="226"> </span>
        by his large circle of friends and
        acquaintances Owen Garry. The exhibition, which is the result of years
        of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system,
        comprises, among other achievements, the recitation of <span data-edition="ed1961" data-page="311"> </span>verse. Our
        greatest living phonetic expert (wild horses shall not drag it from us!)
        has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare
        the verse recited and has found it bears a <i>striking</i> resemblance 
        <span data-edition="ed1922" data-page="298"> </span>
        (the italics are ours) to the ranns of ancient Celtic bards. We are not
        speaking so much of <Annotation annotationId="090003hyde" annotationSelect={() => openNote("090003hyde")} activeAnnotationId={currentNoteId}>those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who
        conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the Little
        Sweet Branch has familiarised the bookloving world</Annotation> but rather (as
        a contributor D. O. C. points out in an interesting communication
        published by an evening contemporary) of the harsher and more personal
        note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous Raftery and
        of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present
        very much in the public eye. We subjoin a specimen which has been
        rendered into English by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we
        are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will
        find the topical allusion rather more than an indication. The metrical
        system of the canine original, which recalls the intricate alliterative
        and isosyllabic rules of the Welsh englyn, is infinitely more
        complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has
        been well caught. Perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly
        increased if Owen's verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in
        a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour.

        So he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could
        hear him lapping it up a mile off. And Joe asked him would he have

        Gob, he's not as green as he's cabbagelooking. Arsing around from one
        pub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old Giltrap's dog
        and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators. Entertainment for
        man and beast. And says Joe:

        —{" "}Could you make a hole in another pint?

      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}Thank you, no, says Bloom. As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet

        Martin asked me to go to the house. You see, he, Dignam, I mean, didn't
        serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and
        nominally under the act the mortgagee can't recover on the policy.

      <p>
        —{" "}Well, that's a point, says Bloom, for the wife's admirers.

        Then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act
        like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit
        of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that
        Dignam owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow
        contested the mortgagee's right till he near had the head of me addled
        with his mortgagor under the act. He was bloody safe he wasn't run in
        himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a
        friend in court. Selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal

        israelite! Royal and privileged Hungarian robbery.
      </p>
      <p>
        So Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he
        was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and
        to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was
        never a truer, a finer than poor little Willy that's dead to tell her.
        Choking with bloody foolery. And shaking Bloom's hand doing the tragic
        to tell her that. Shake hands, brother. You're a rogue and I'm another.

        And off with him and out trying to walk straight. Boosed at five
        o'clock. Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the

        closing time, fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard, drinking

        the new testament, and the old testament, and hugging and smugging. And
        the two shawls killed with the laughing, picking his pockets, the bloody
        fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls
        screeching laughing at one another. <i>How is your testament? Have you got
        an old testament?</i> Only Paddy was passing there, I tell you what. Then
        see him of a Sunday with his little concubine of a wife, and she wagging
        her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her, no
        less, and her violets, nice as pie, doing the little lady. Jack Mooney's

        The wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old tongue, Mr

        response to repeated 
        <span data-edition="ed1939" data-page="230"> </span>
        requests and hearty plaudits from all parts of
        a bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy rendering of the immortal
        Thomas Osborne Davis' evergreen verses (happily too familiar to need
        recalling here) <i>A nation once again</i> in the execution of which the
        veteran patriot champion may be said without fear of contradiction
        to have fairly excelled himself. The Irish Caruso-Garibaldi was in
        superlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the greatest
        advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen can sing
        it. His superb highclass vocalism, which by its superquality greatly
        enhanced his already international reputation, was vociferously
        applauded by the large audience among which were to be noticed many
        prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press
        and the bar and the other learned professions. The proceedings then
        terminated.

      <p>
        —{" "}Now, don't you think, Bergan?

      <p>
        —{" "}Myler dusted the floor with him, says Alf. Heenan and Sayers was only
        a bloody fool to it. Handed him the father and mother of a beating. See
        the little kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping. God,
        he gave him one last puck in the wind, Queensberry rules and all, made
        him puke what he never ate.

        It was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy were scheduled
        to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns. Handicapped as he
        was by lack of poundage, Dublin's pet lamb made up for it by superlative
        skill in ringcraft. The final bout of fireworks was a gruelling for both
        champions. The welterweight sergeantmajor had tapped some lively claret
        in the previous mixup during which Keogh had been receivergeneral of
        rights and lefts, the artilleryman putting in some neat work on the
        pet's nose, and Myler came on looking groggy. The soldier 
        <span data-edition="ed1939" data-page="231"> </span>
        got to
        business, leading off with a powerful left jab to which the Irish
        gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the point of
        Bennett's jaw. The redcoat ducked but the Dubliner lifted him with a
        left hook, the body punch being a fine one. The men came to <span data-edition="ed1932" data-page="287"> </span>handigrips.
        Myler <span data-edition="ed1961" data-page="318"> </span>quickly became busy and got his man under, the bout ending with
        the bulkier man on the ropes, Myler punishing him. The Englishman, whose
        right eye was nearly closed, took his corner where he was liberally
        drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey and brimful of
        pluck, confident of knocking out the fistic Eblanite in jigtime. It was
        a fight to a finish and the best man for it. <span data-edition="ed1986" data-page="261"> </span>The two fought like tigers
        and excitement ran fever high. The referee twice cautioned Pucking Percy
        for holding but the pet was tricky and his footwork a treat to watch.
        After a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper cut of
        the military man brought blood freely from his opponent's mouth the
        lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and landed a terrific left to
        Battling Bennett's stomach, flooring him flat. It was a knockout clean and 
        <span data-edition="ed1922" data-page="305"> </span>
        clever. Amid tense expectation the <Annotation annotationId="010013barracks" annotationSelect={() => openNote("010013barracks")} activeAnnotationId={currentNoteId}>Portobello</Annotation> bruiser was being
        counted out when Bennett's second Ole Pfotts Wettstein threw in the
        towel and the Santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied cheers of
        the public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with
        delight.

        The milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and, rising in the golden poop the
        helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off forward
        with all sail set, the spinnaker to larboard. A many comely nymphs drew
        nigh to starboard and to larboard and, clinging to the sides of
        the noble bark, they linked their shining forms as doth the <span data-edition="ed1932" data-page="308"> </span>cunning

        But begob I was just lowering the heel of the pint when I saw the

        And all the ragamuffins and sluts of the nation round the door and
        Martin telling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and Alf
        and Joe at him to whisht and he on his high horse about the jews and

        A large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from
        the metropolis and greater Dublin assembled in their thousands to bid
        <span data-edition="ed1932" data-page="309"> </span>farewell to

        Murmuring <span data-edition="ed1961" data-page="342"> </span>Waters). The ceremony which went off with great <i>éclat</i> was
        characterised by the most affecting cordiality. An illuminated scroll
        of ancient Irish vellum, the work of Irish artists, was presented to
        the <span data-edition="ed1986" data-page="280"> </span>distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the
        community and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket, tastefully
        executed in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work which reflects
        every credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob <i>agus</i> Jacob. The departing
        guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of those who were
        present being visibly moved when the select orchestra of Irish pipes
        struck up the wellknown strains of <i>Come back to Erin</i>, followed
        immediately by <i>Rakoczsy's March</i>. Tarbarrels and bonfires were lighted
        along the coastline of the four seas on the summits of the Hill of

        henchmen on the distant Cambrian and Caledonian hills, the mastodontic
        pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final floral tribute from
        the representatives of the fair sex who were present in large numbers
        while, as it proceeded down the river, escorted by a flotilla of barges,
        the flags of the <Annotation annotationId="080007ballastoffice" annotationSelect={() => openNote("080007ballastoffice")} activeAnnotationId={currentNoteId}>Ballast office</Annotation> and Custom House were dipped in salute

        The catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect. The
        observatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of the fifth
        grade of Mercalli's scale, and there is no record extant of a similar
        seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of 1534, the year
        of <Annotation annotationId="030058pretenders" annotationSelect={() => openNote("030058pretenders")} activeAnnotationId={currentNoteId}>the rebellion of Silken Thomas</Annotation>. The epicentre appears to have been
        that part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inn's Quay ward and
        parish of Saint Michan covering a surface of fortyone acres, two roods
        and one square pole or perch. All the lordly residences in the vicinity
        of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble edifice itself,
        in which at the time of the <span data-edition="ed1986" data-page="281"> </span>catastrophe important legal debates were in
        progress, is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it is to be
        feared all the occupants have been buried alive. From the reports of
        eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were accompanied by
        a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic character. An article of
        headgear since ascertained to belong to the much respected clerk of the
        crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a silk umbrella with gold handle
        with the engraved initials, crest, coat of arms and house number of
        the erudite and worshipful chairman of quarter sessions <Annotation annotationId="080002sirfrederick" annotationSelect={() => openNote("080002sirfrederick")} activeAnnotationId={currentNoteId}>sir Frederick

        in remote parts of the island respectively, the former on the third
        basaltic ridge of the giant's causeway, the latter embedded to the
        extent of one foot three inches in the sandy beach of Holeopen bay near
        the old head of Kinsale. Other eyewitnesses depose that they observed
        an incandescent object of enormous proportions hurtling through the
        atmosphere at a terrifying velocity in a trajectory directed southwest
        by west. Messages of condolence and sympathy are being hourly received
        from all parts of the different continents and the sovereign pontiff has
        been graciously pleased to decree that a special <i>missa pro defunctis</i>
        shall be celebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries of each and every
        cathedral church of all the episcopal dioceses subject to the spiritual
        authority of the Holy See in suffrage of the souls of those faithful
        departed who have been so unexpectedly called away from our midst.
        The work of salvage, removal of <i>débris,</i> human remains etc has been
        entrusted to Messrs Michael Meade and Son, 159 Great Brunswick street,
        and Messrs T. and C. Martin, 77, 78, 79 and 80 North Wall, <span data-edition="ed1961" data-page="344"> </span>assisted by
