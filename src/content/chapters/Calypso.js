      <button className="bg-gray-300 bg-center bg-cover hover:bg-green-300" onClick={() => openNote("040030leopoldbloom")}>Mr Leopold Bloom</button> ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls.
      He liked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart,
      liverslices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencods' roes. Most of all
      he liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of
      faintly scented urine.

        <button className="bg-gray-300 bg-center bg-cover hover:bg-green-300" onClick={() => openNote("040009kidneys")}>Kidneys were in his mind</button> as he moved about the kitchen softly, righting

        The coals were reddening.

        Another slice of bread and butter : <button className="bg-gray-300 bg-center bg-cover hover:bg-green-300" onClick={() => openNote("040011rightright")}>three, four : right. She didn't like
        her plate full. Right.</button> He turned from the tray, lifted the kettle off
        the hob and set it sideways on the fire. It sat there, <button className="bg-gray-300 bg-center bg-cover hover:bg-green-300" onClick={() => openNote("040022lickingclean")}>dull and squat,
        its spout stuck out</button>. Cup of tea soon. Good. Mouth dry. The cat walked
        stiffly round a leg of the table with tail on high.

      <p>
        —{" "}O, there you are, Mr Bloom said, turning from the fire.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the
        table, mewing. Just how she stalks over my writingtable. Prr. Scratch my
        head. Prr.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr Bloom watched curiously, kindly, the lithe black form. Clean to see:
        the gloss of her sleek hide, the white <button className="bg-gray-300 bg-center bg-cover hover:bg-green-300" onClick={() => openNote("040015whitebutton")}>button under the butt</button> of her
        tail, the green flashing eyes. He bent down to her, his hands on his

      </p>

        —{" "}Milk for the pussens, he said.

        —{" "}Mrkrgnao! the cat said loudly.
      </p>
      <p>
        She blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes, mewing plaintively
        and long, showing him her milkwhite teeth. He watched the dark eyeslits
        narrowing with greed till her eyes were <button className="bg-gray-300 bg-center bg-cover hover:bg-green-300" onClick={() => openNote("010142greenstone")}>green stones</button>. Then he went to

      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}Gurrhr! she cried, running to lap.
      </p>
      <p>
        He watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped
        three times and licked lightly. <button className="bg-gray-300 bg-center bg-cover hover:bg-green-300" onClick={() => openNote("040013wonderisittrue")}>Wonder is it true if you clip them they

        kind of feelers in the dark, perhaps.</button>
      </p>
      <p>
        He listened to her licking lap. Ham and eggs, no. No good eggs with this
        drouth. Want pure fresh water. Thursday: not a good day either for a
        mutton kidney at <button className="bg-gray-300 bg-center bg-cover hover:bg-green-300" onClick={() => openNote("040062bolandsbread")}>Buckley's</button>. Fried with butter, a shake of pepper. <button className="bg-gray-300 bg-center bg-cover hover:bg-green-300" onClick={() => openNote("040083hewasajew")}>Better

        slower, then <button className="bg-gray-300 bg-center bg-cover hover:bg-green-300" onClick={() => openNote("040022lickingclean")}>licking the saucer clean</button>. Why are their tongues so rough?
        To lap better, all porous holes. Nothing she can eat? He glanced round
        him. No.
      </p>
      <p>
        On quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall, paused by
        the bedroom door. She might like something tasty. <button className="bg-gray-300 bg-center bg-cover hover:bg-green-300" onClick={() => openNote("040022lickingclean")}>Thin bread and butter</button>
        she likes in the morning. Still perhaps: once in a way.
      </p>
      <p>
        He said softly in the bare hall:
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}I'm going round the corner. Be back in a minute.
      </p>
      <p>
        And when he had heard his voice say it he added:
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}You don't want anything for breakfast?
      </p>
      <p>
        A sleepy soft grunt answered:

      <p>
        <button className="bg-gray-300 bg-center bg-cover hover:bg-green-300" onClick={() => openNote("040070mrkgnao")}>—{" "}Mn.</button>
      </p>
      <p>
        No. She did not want anything. He heard then a warm heavy sigh, softer,
        as she turned over and <button className="bg-gray-300 bg-center bg-cover hover:bg-green-300" onClick={() => openNote("040085brassquoits")}>the loose brass quoits</button> of the bedstead <button className="bg-gray-300 bg-center bg-cover hover:bg-green-300" onClick={() => openNote("040091jingle")}>jingled</button>.
        Must get those settled really. Pity. All the way from Gibraltar.
        Forgotten any little Spanish she knew. Wonder what her father gave for
        it. Old style. Ah yes! of course. Bought it at the governor's auction.
        <button className="bg-gray-300 bg-center bg-cover hover:bg-green-300" onClick={() => openNote("040059shortknock")}>Got a short knock.</button> Hard as nails at a bargain, <button className="bg-gray-300 bg-center bg-cover hover:bg-green-300" onClick={() => openNote("040018oldtweedy")}>old Tweedy. Yes, sir. At
        Plevna that was. I rose from the ranks, sir, and I'm proud of it.</button>
        Still he had brains enough to <button className="bg-gray-300 bg-center bg-cover hover:bg-green-300" onClick={() => openNote("040059shortknock")}>make that corner in stamps</button>. Now that was
        farseeing.

      <span data-edition="ed1922" data-page="54"></span>

        His hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoat
        and his <button className="bg-gray-300 bg-center bg-cover hover:bg-green-300" onClick={() => openNote("040059shortknock")}>lost property office</button> secondhand waterproof. Stamps: stickyback<span data-edition="ed1932" data-page="49"></span>

        The sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely: <button className="bg-gray-300 bg-center bg-cover hover:bg-green-300" onClick={() => openNote("040062bolandsbread")}>Plasto's</button>
        <button className="bg-gray-300 bg-center bg-cover hover:bg-green-300" onClick={() => openNote("040082highgradeha")}>high grade ha</button>.

        No use disturbing her. She turned over sleepily that time. He pulled
        the halldoor to after him very quietly, more, <button className="bg-gray-300 bg-center bg-cover hover:bg-green-300" onClick={() => openNote("040051footleaf")}>till the footleaf dropped

        that light suit. Make a<span data-edition="ed1986" data-page="46"></span> picnic of it. His eyelids sank quietly often as

        Makes you feel young. Somewhere in the east: early morning: set off at
        dawn. Travel round in front of the sun, steal a day's march on him. Keep
        it up for ever never grow a day older technically. Walk along a strand,
        strange land, come to a city gate, sentry there, <button className="bg-gray-300 bg-center bg-cover hover:bg-green-300" onClick={() => openNote("040018oldtweedy")}>old ranker too, old

        streets. Drink water scented with fennel, <button className="bg-gray-300 bg-center bg-cover hover:bg-green-300" onClick={() => openNote("040012sherbet")}>sherbet</button>. Dander along all day. Might meet a robber or two. Well,
        meet him. Getting on to sundown. The shadows of the mosques among the
        pillars: priest with a scroll rolled up. A shiver of the trees, signal,
        the evening wind. I pass on. Fading gold sky. A mother watches me from
        her doorway. She calls her children home in their dark language. High

        blotchy fingers, sausagepink. Sound meat there: like a stallfed heifer.
      </p>
      <p>
        He took a page up from the pile of cut sheets: <button className="bg-gray-300 bg-center bg-cover hover:bg-green-300" onClick={() => openNote("040061agendath")}>the model farm at
        Kinnereth on the lakeshore of Tiberias. Can become ideal winter
        sanatorium. Moses Montefiore.</button> I thought he was. Farmhouse, wall round
        it, blurred cattle cropping. He held the page from him: interesting:
        read it nearer, the title, the blurred cropping cattle, the page
        rustling. A young white heifer. <button className="bg-gray-300 bg-center bg-cover hover:bg-green-300" onClick={() => openNote("040037cattlemarket")}>Those mornings in the cattlemarket</button>, the
        beasts lowing in their pens, branded sheep, flop and fall of dung, the
        breeders in hobnailed boots trudging through the litter, slapping a palm
        on a ripemeated hindquarter, there's a prime one, unpeeled switches in
        their hands. He held the page aslant patiently, <button className="bg-gray-300 bg-center bg-cover hover:bg-green-300" onClick={() => openNote("040017seemtolikeit")}>bending his senses and
        his will, his soft subject gaze at rest. The crooked skirt swinging,
        whack by whack by whack.</button>
      </p>
      <p>
        The porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile, wrapped up her prime
        sausages and made a red grimace.

        —{" "}Now, my miss, he said.
      </p>
      <p>
        She tendered a coin, smiling boldly, holding her thick wrist out.

        —{" "}Thank you, my miss. And one shilling threepence change. For you,

        Mr Bloom pointed quickly. To catch up and walk behind her if she went
        slowly, behind her moving hams. Pleasant to see first thing in the
        morning. Hurry up, damn it. Make hay while the sun shines. She stood
        outside the shop in sunlight and sauntered lazily to the right. He
        sighed down his nose: they never understand. Sodachapped hands. Crusted
        toenails too. <button className="bg-gray-300 bg-center bg-cover hover:bg-green-300" onClick={() => openNote("040036scapulars")}>Brown scapulars</button> in tatters, defending her both ways.
        The sting<span data-edition="ed1961" data-page="59"></span> of disregard glowed to weak pleasure within his breast. For

      <p>
        His hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a sidepocket.<span data-edition="ed1932" data-page="52"></span>
        Then it fetched up three coins from his trousers' pocket and laid them
        on the rubber prickles. They lay, were read quickly and quickly slid,
        disc by disc, into the till.
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}Thank you, sir. Another time.
      </p>
      <p>
        A speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him. He withdrew his gaze
        after an instant. No: better not: another time.
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}Good morning, he said, moving away.

        He looked at the cattle, blurred in silver heat. Silverpowdered
        olivetrees. Quiet long days: pruning, ripening. Olives are packed in

        Two letters and a card lay on the hallfloor. He stooped and gathered

      </p>
      <p>
        Entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm
        yellow twilight towards her tousled head.
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}Who are the letters for?
      </p>
      <span data-edition="ed1961" data-page="61"></span>
      <p>
        He looked at them. <button className="bg-gray-300 bg-center bg-cover hover:bg-green-300" onClick={() => openNote("010126mullingar")}>Mullingar.</button> Milly.
      </p>

        —{" "}A letter for me from Milly, he said carefully, and a card to you. And
        a letter for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        He laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve of her
        knees.
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}Do you want the blind up?
      </p>
      <p>
        Letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway<button className="bg-gray-300 bg-center bg-cover hover:bg-green-300" onClick={() => openNote("040042backwardeye")}> his backward eye</button> saw her
        glance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow.
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}That do? he asked, turning.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was reading the card, propped on her elbow.
      </p>
      <span data-edition="ed1922" data-page="59"></span>
      <p>
        —{" "}She got the things, she said.

      <span data-edition="ed1986" data-page="50"></span>
      <p>
        He waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back
        slowly with a snug sigh.
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}Hurry up with that tea, she said. I'm parched.
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}The kettle is boiling, he said.
      </p>
      <p>
        But he delayed to clear the chair: her striped petticoat, tossed soiled
        linen: and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed.
      </p>
      <p>
        As he went down the kitchen stairs she called:
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}Poldy!
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}What?
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}Scald the teapot.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the boil sure enough: a plume of steam from the spout. He scalded and
        rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea, tilting the
        kettle then to let water flow in. Having set it to draw he took off
        the kettle, crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watched the lump
        of butter slide and melt. While he unwrapped the kidney the cat mewed
        hungrily against him. Give her too much meat she won't mouse. Say they
        won't eat pork. <button className="bg-gray-300 bg-center bg-cover hover:bg-green-300" onClick={() => openNote("040083hewasajew")}>Kosher.</button> Here. He let the bloodsmeared paper fall to
        her and dropped the kidney amid the sizzling butter sauce. Pepper. He
        sprinkled it through his fingers ringwise from the chipped eggcup.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he slit open his letter, glancing down the page and over. Thanks:
        new tam: Mr Coghlan: lough Owel picnic: young student: Blazes Boylan's
        seaside girls.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tea was drawn. He filled his own <button className="bg-gray-300 bg-center bg-cover hover:bg-green-300" onClick={() => openNote("040055moustachecup")}>moustachecup, sham crown Derby</button>, smiling. Silly Milly's birthday gift. Only five she was then. No, wait: four. I gave her the amberoid necklace she broke. Putting pieces
        of folded brown paper in the letterbox for her. He smiled, pouring.

        look what I found in professor Goodwin's hat! All we
        laughed. Sex breaking out even then. Pert little piece she was.
      </p>
      <p>
        He prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over: then fitted the
        teapot on the tray. Its hump bumped as he took it up. Everything on
        it? Bread and butter, four, sugar, spoon, her cream. Yes. He carried it
        upstairs, his thumb hooked in the teapot handle.
      </p>
      <span data-edition="ed1932" data-page="55"></span>

        Nudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set it on

      <p>
        —{" "}What a time you were, she said.
      </p>
      <p>
        She set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly, an elbow on
        the pillow. He looked calmly down on her bulk and between <button className="bg-gray-300 bg-center bg-cover hover:bg-green-300" onClick={() => openNote("040058shegoatsudder")}>her large soft<span data-edition="ed1986" data-page="51"></span>

      <p>
        A strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow. In the
        act of going he stayed to straighten the bedspread.
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}Who was the letter from? he asked.

      <p>
        Bold hand. Marion.

      <p>
        —{" "}O, Boylan, she said. He's bringing the programme.

      <p>
        Her full lips, drinking, smiled. Rather stale smell that incense leaves
        next day. Like foul flowerwater.
      </p>
      <p>
        —{" "}Would you like the window open a little?
      </p>
      <p>
        She doubled a slice of bread into her mouth, asking:

        —{" "}What time is the funeral?

      <p>
        —{" "}Eleven, I think, he answered. I didn't see the paper.

      <p>
        Following the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soiled
        drawers from the bed. No? Then, a twisted grey garter looped round a
        stocking: rumpled, shiny sole.

        certainly. <button className="bg-gray-300 bg-center bg-cover hover:bg-green-300" onClick={() => openNote("040065matcham")}><i>Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke by which he won the

        Might manage a sketch. By Mr and Mrs L. M. Bloom. Invent a story for
        some proverb. Which? Time I used to try jotting down on my cuff what she
        said dressing. Dislike dressing together. Nicked myself shaving. Biting
        her nether lip, hooking the placket of her skirt. Timing her. 9.l5.
        Did Roberts pay you yet? 9.20. What had <button className="bg-gray-300 bg-center bg-cover hover:bg-green-300" onClick={() => openNote("040027conroy")}>Gretta Conroy</button> on? 9.23. What

        night hours. Washing her teeth. That was the first night. Her head
        dancing. Her fansticks clicking. Is that Boylan well off? He has money.
        Why? I noticed he had a good rich smell off his breath dancing. No use
        humming then. Allude to it. Strange kind of music that last night. The
        mirror was in shadow. She rubbed her handglass briskly on her woollen
        vest against her full wagging bub. Peering into it. Lines in her eyes.
        It wouldn't pan out somehow.

        Evening hours, girls in grey gauze. Night hours then: black with daggers
        and eyemasks. Poetical idea: pink, then golden, then grey, then black.
        Still, true to life also. Day: then the night.

        back the jerky shaky door of the jakes and came forth from the gloom
        into the air.

        In the bright light, lightened and cooled in limb, he eyed carefully his
        black trousers: the ends, the knees, the houghs of the knees. What time
        is the funeral? Better find out in the paper.
