      He liked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart,
      liverslices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencods' roes. Most of all
      he liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of
      faintly scented urine.

        The cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the

        Mr Bloom watched curiously, kindly, the lithe black form. Clean to see:

        She blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes, mewing plaintively
        and long, showing him her milkwhite teeth. He watched the dark eyeslits

        He listened to her licking lap. Ham and eggs, no. No good eggs with this
        drouth. Want pure fresh water. Thursday: not a good day either for a

        To lap better, all porous holes. Nothing she can eat? He glanced round
        him. No.
      </p>
      <p>
        On quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall, paused by
        the bedroom door. She might like something tasty. <Annotation annotationId="040022lickingclean" annotationSelect={() => openNote("040022lickingclean")} activeAnnotationId={currentNoteId}>Thin bread and butter</Annotation>
        she likes in the morning. Still perhaps: once in a way.
      </p>
      <p>
        He said softly in the bare hall:

      <p>
        —{" "}I'm going round the corner. Be back in a minute.

      <p>

      <p>

      <p>
        No. She did not want anything. He heard then a warm heavy sigh, softer,

        Must get those settled really. Pity. All the way from Gibraltar.
        Forgotten any little Spanish she knew. Wonder what her father gave for

        On the boil sure enough: a plume of steam from the spout. He scalded and
        rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea, tilting the
        kettle then to let water flow in. Having set it to draw he took off
        the kettle, crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watched the lump
        of butter slide and melt. While he unwrapped the kidney the cat mewed

        Rubbing smartly in turn<span data-edition="ed1986" data-page="56"></span> each welt against her stockinged calf. Morning
        after the bazaar dance when <Annotation annotationId="040062bolandsbread" annotationSelect={() => openNote("040062bolandsbread")} activeAnnotationId={currentNoteId}>May's band</Annotation> played <Annotation annotationId="040016danceofthehours" annotationSelect={() => openNote("040016danceofthehours")} activeAnnotationId={currentNoteId}>Ponchielli's dance of the
        hours</Annotation>. Explain that: morning hours, noon, then evening coming on, then
        night hours. Washing her teeth. That was the first night. Her head
        dancing. Her fansticks clicking. Is that Boylan well off? He has money.
        Why? I noticed he had a good rich smell off his breath dancing. No use
        humming then. Allude to it. Strange kind of music that last night. The
        mirror was in shadow. She rubbed her handglass briskly on her woollen
        vest against her full wagging bub. Peering into it. Lines in her eyes.
        It wouldn't pan out somehow.

        Evening hours, girls in grey gauze. Night hours then: black with daggers
        and eyemasks. Poetical idea: pink, then golden, then grey, then black.
        Still, true to life also. Day: then the night.

        He tore away half the prize story sharply and wiped himself with it.
        Then he girded up his trousers, braced and buttoned himself. He pulled
        back the jerky shaky door of the jakes and came forth from the gloom
        into the air.

        In the bright light, lightened and cooled in limb, he eyed carefully his
        black trousers: the ends, the knees, the houghs of the knees. What time
        is the funeral? Better find out in the paper.
