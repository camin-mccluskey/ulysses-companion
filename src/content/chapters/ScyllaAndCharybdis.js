        a <i>buonaroba,</i> a bay where all men ride, a maid of honour with a
        scandalous girlhood, a lordling to woo for him? He was himself a lord
        of language and had made himself a coistrel gentleman and had written
        <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>. Why? Belief in himself has been untimely killed. He
        was overborne in a cornfield first (ryefield, I should say) and he will
        never be a victor in his own eyes after nor play victoriously the game

        remains to her woman's invisible weapon. There is, I feel in the words,
        some goad of the flesh driving him into a new passion, a darker shadow
        of the first, darkening even his own understanding of himself. A like

        Shakespeare, what the poor is not, always with him. The note of
        banishment, banishment from the heart, banishment from home, sounds
        uninterruptedly from <i>The Two Gentlemen of Verona</i> onward till Prospero
        breaks his staff, buries it certain fathoms in the earth and drowns his
        book. It doubles itself in the middle of his life, reflects itself in
        another, repeats itself, protasis, epitasis, catastasis, catastrophe.
        It repeats itself again when he is near the grave, when his married
        daughter Susan, chip of the old block, is accused of adultery. But it
        was the original sin that darkened his understanding, weakened his will
        and left in him a strong inclination to evil. The words are those of
        my lords bishops of Maynooth: an original sin and, like original sin,
