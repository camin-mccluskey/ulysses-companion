        Mr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand, then those of his right
        hand. The nails, yes. Is there anything more in him that they she sees?
        Fascination. Worst man in Dublin. That keeps him alive. They sometimes
        feel what a person is. Instinct. But a type like that. My nails. I
        am just looking at them: well pared. And after: thinking alone. Body
        getting a bit softy. I would notice that: from remembering. What causes
        that? I suppose the skin can't contract quickly enough when the flesh
        falls off. But the shape is there. The shape is there still. Shoulders.

        The caretaker put the papers in his pocket. The barrow had ceased to

        Burying him. We come to bury Caesar. His ides of March or June. He

        over there in the macintosh? Now who is he I'd like to know? Now I'd
        give a trifle to know who he is. Always someone turns up you never
        dreamt of. A fellow could live on his lonesome all his life. Yes, he
        could. Still he'd have to get someone to sod him after he died though he
        could dig his own grave. We all do. Only man buries. No, ants too. First
        thing strikes anybody. Bury the dead. Say Robinson Crusoe was true to

        A seventh gravedigger came beside Mr Bloom to take up an idle spade.

        He stepped aside nimbly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clay, brown, damp, began to be seen in the hole. It rose. Nearly over.
        A mound of damp clods rose more, rose, and the gravediggers<span data-edition="ed1932" data-page="100"></span> rested their
        spades. All uncovered again for a few instants. The boy propped
        his wreath against a corner: the brother-in-law his on a lump. The
        gravediggers put on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards
        the barrow. Then knocked the blades lightly on the turf: clean. One bent
        to pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass. One, leaving his mates,
        walked slowly on with shouldered weapon, its blade blueglancing.
        Silently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband. His navelcord.
        The brother-in-law, turning away, placed something in his free hand.
        Thanks in silence. Sorry, sir: trouble. Headshake. I know that. For
        yourselves just.

        Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses,
        broken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes,
        old Ireland's hearts and hands. More sensible to spend the money on some
        charity for the living. Pray for the repose of the soul of. Does anybody
        really? Plant him and have done with him. Like down a coalshoot. Then

        Old man himself. Bent down double with his shears clipping. Near death's
        door. Who passed away. Who departed this life. As if they did it of
        their own accord. Got the shove, all of them. Who kicked the
        bucket. More interesting if they told you what they were. So and So,
        wheelwright. I travelled for cork lino. I paid five shillings in the
        pound. Or a woman's with her saucepan. I cooked good Irish stew.

        Flies come before he's well dead. Got wind of Dignam. They wouldn't care
