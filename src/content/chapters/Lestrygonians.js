        in skimpy frockcoat and blue canvas shoes shuffled out of Harrison's

        scattered, saluting towards

        Davy Byrne came forward from the hindbar in tuckstitched shirtsleeves,
        cleaning his lips with two wipes of his napkin. Herring's blush. Whose

        Mr Bloom ate his strips of sandwich, fresh clean bread, with relish of
        disgust pungent mustard, the feety savour of green cheese. Sips of his
        wine soothed his palate. Not logwood that. Tastes fuller this weather
        with the chill off.

        Mild fire of wine kindled his veins. I wanted that badly. Felt so
        off colour. His eyes unhungrily saw shelves of tins: sardines, gaudy

        you weren't there. If you ask him to have a drink first thing he does
        he outs with the watch to see what he ought to imbibe. Declare to God he

        Mr Bloom walked towards Dawson street, his tongue brushing his teeth
        smooth. Something green it would have to be: spinach, say. <button className="bg-gray-300 bg-center bg-cover hover:bg-green-300" onClick={() => openNote("080011xrays")}>Then with

        free. Course then you'd have all the cranks pestering.

        Mr Bloom turned at Gray's confectioner's window of unbought tarts and
        passed the reverend Thomas Connellan's bookstore. <i>Why I left the church
        of Rome? Birds' Nest.</i> Women run him. They say they used to give pauper
        children soup to change to protestants in the time of the potato blight.

      <p>
        A blind stripling stood tapping the curbstone with his slender cane. No
        tram in sight. Wants to cross.
      </p>
      <p>
        â€”{" "}Do you want to cross? Mr Bloom asked.
      </p>
      <p>
        The blind stripling did not answer. His wallface frowned weakly. He
        moved his head uncertainly.
      </p>
      <p>
        â€”{" "}You're in Dawson street, Mr Bloom said. Molesworth street is opposite.
        Do you want to cross? There's nothing in the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cane moved out trembling to the left. Mr Bloom's eye followed its
        line and saw again the dyeworks' van drawn up before <button className="bg-gray-300 bg-center bg-cover hover:bg-green-300" onClick={() => openNote("040062bolandsbread")}>Drago's</button>. Where I
        saw his brillantined hair just when I <span data-edition="ed1961" data-page="180">  </span>was. Horse drooping. Driver in
        John Long's. Slaking his drouth.
      </p>
      <p>
        â€”{" "}There's a van there, Mr Bloom said, but it's not moving. I'll see you
        across. Do you want to go to Molesworth street?
      </p>
      <p>
        â€”{" "}Yes, the stripling answered. South Frederick street.

      <p>
        â€”{" "}Come, Mr Bloom said.
      </p>
      <p>
        He touched the thin elbow gently: then took the limp seeing hand to
        guide it forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        Say something to him. Better not do the condescending. They <span data-edition="ed1932" data-page="161">  </span>mistrust

        Stains on his coat. Slobbers his food I suppose. Tastes all different
        for him. Have to be spoonfed first. Like a child's hand, his hand. Like
        Milly's was. Sensitive. Sizing me up I daresay from my hand. Wonder
        if he has a name. Van. Keep his cane clear of the horse's legs: tired
        drudge get his doze. That's right. Clear. Behind a bull: in front of a
        horse.
      </p>
      <p>
        â€”{" "}Thanks, sir.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        â€”{" "}Right now? First turn to the left.
      </p>
      <p>
        The blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way, drawing
        his cane back, feeling again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr Bloom walked behind the eyeless feet, a flatcut suit of herringbone
        tweed. Poor young fellow! How on earth did he know that van was there?
        Must have felt it. See things in their foreheads perhaps: kind of sense
        of <span data-edition="ed1986" data-page="148"> </span>volume. Weight or size of it, something blacker than the dark. Wonder
        would he feel it if something was removed. Feel a gap. Queer idea of
        Dublin he must have, tapping his way round by the stones. Could he walk
        in a beeline if he hadn't that cane? Bloodless pious face like a fellow
        going in to be a priest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Penrose! That was that chap's name.
      </p>
      <span data-edition="ed1939" data-page="132"> </span>
      <p>
        Look at all the things they can learn to do. Read with their fingers.
        Tune pianos. Or we are surprised they have any brains. Why we think a
        deformed person or a hunchback clever if he says something we might say.
        Of course the other senses are more. Embroider. Plait baskets. People
        ought to help. Workbasket I could buy Molly's birthday. Hates
        sewing. Might take an objection. Dark men they call them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sense of smell must be stronger too. Smells on all sides, bunched
        together. Each street different smell. Each person too. Then the spring,
        the summer: smells. Tastes? They say you can't taste wines with your
        <span data-edition="ed1961" data-page="181">  </span>eyes shut or a cold in the head. Also smoke in the dark they say get no pleasure.
      </p>
      <p>
        And with a woman, for instance. More shameless not seeing. That girl
        passing the Stewart institution, head in the air. Look at me. I have
        them all on. Must be strange not to see her. Kind of a form in his
        mind's eye. The voice, temperature when he touches her with his
        fingers must almost see the lines, the curves. His hands on her hair,
        for instance. Say it was black, for instance. Good. We call it black.
        Then passing over her white skin. Different feel perhaps. Feeling of
        white.
      </p>
      <p>
        Postoffice. Must answer. Fag today. Send her a postal order two
        <span data-edition="ed1932" data-page="162"> </span>shillings, half a crown. Accept my little present. Stationer's just here
        too. Wait. Think over it.
        <span data-edition="ed1922" data-page="173">  </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        With a gentle finger he felt ever so slowly the hair combed back above
        his ears. Again. Fibres of fine fine straw. Then gently his finger felt
        the skin of his right cheek. Downy hair there too. Not smooth enough.
        The belly is the smoothest. No-one about. There he goes into Frederick
        street. Perhaps to Levenston's dancing academy piano. Might be settling
        my braces.
      </p>
      <p>
        Walking by Doran's publichouse he slid his hand between waistcoat
        and trousers and, pulling aside his shirt gently, felt a slack fold of
        his belly. But I know it's whitey yellow. Want to try in the dark to
        see.
      </p>
      <p>
        He withdrew his hand and pulled his dress to.
      </p>
      <p>
        Poor fellow! Quite a boy. Terrible. Really terrible. What dreams would
        he have, not seeing? Life a dream for him. Where is the justice being
        born that way? <button className="bg-gray-300 bg-center bg-cover hover:bg-green-300" onClick={() => openNote("100008generalslocum")}>All those women and children excursion beanfeast burned
