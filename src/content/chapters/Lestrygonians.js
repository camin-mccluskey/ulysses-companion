        Same blue serge dress she had two years ago, the nap bleaching. Seen its

        Of course the other senses are more. Embroider. Plait baskets. People
        ought to help. Workbasket I could buy Molly's birthday. Hates
        sewing. Might take an objection. Dark men they call them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sense of smell must be stronger too. Smells on all sides, bunched
        together. Each street different smell. Each person too. Then the spring,
        the summer: smells. Tastes? They say you can't taste wines with your
        <span data-edition="ed1961" data-page="181">  </span>eyes shut or a cold in the head. Also smoke in the dark they say get no pleasure.
      </p>
      <p>
        And with a woman, for instance. More shameless not seeing. That girl
        passing the Stewart institution, head in the air. Look at me. I have
        them all on. Must be strange not to see her. Kind of a form in his
        mind's eye. The voice, temperature when he touches her with his
        fingers must almost see the lines, the curves. His hands on her hair,
        for instance. Say it was black, for instance. Good. We call it black.
        Then passing over her white skin. Different feel perhaps. Feeling of
        white.
      </p>
      <p>
        Postoffice. Must answer. Fag today. Send her a postal order two
        <span data-edition="ed1932" data-page="162"> </span>shillings, half a crown. Accept my little present. Stationer's just here
        too. Wait. Think over it.

        With a gentle finger he felt ever so slowly the hair combed back above
        his ears. Again. Fibres of fine fine straw. Then gently his finger felt
        the skin of his right cheek. Downy hair there too. Not smooth enough.
        The belly is the smoothest. No-one about. There he goes into Frederick
        street. Perhaps to Levenston's dancing academy piano. Might be settling
        my braces.
      </p>
      <p>
        Walking by Doran's publichouse he slid his hand between waistcoat
        and trousers and, pulling aside his shirt gently, felt a slack fold of
        his belly. But I know it's whitey yellow. Want to try in the dark to
        see.
      </p>
      <p>
        He withdrew his hand and pulled his dress to.
      </p>

        Poor fellow! Quite a boy. Terrible. Really terrible. What dreams would
        he have, not seeing? Life a dream for him. Where is the justice being
        born that way? <Annotation annotationId="100008generalslocum" visited={visitedNotes.has("100008generalslocum")} annotationSelect={() => {openNote("100008generalslocum"); addToVisited("100008generalslocum")}} activeAnnotationId={currentNoteId}>All those women and children excursion beanfeast burned

        His heart quopped softly. To the right. Museum. Goddesses. He swerved to
        the right.

        Making for the museum gate with long windy strides he lifted his eyes.

        The flutter of his breath came forth in short sighs. Quick. Cold

        No. Didn't see me. After two. Just at the gate.

        His eyes beating looked steadfastly at cream curves of stone. Sir Thomas
