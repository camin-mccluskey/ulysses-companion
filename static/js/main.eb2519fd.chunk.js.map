Richard\n        the conqueror, third brother, came after William the conquered. The\n        other four acts of that play hang limply from that first.

The note of\n        banishment, banishment from the heart, banishment from home, sounds\n        uninterruptedly from <i>The Two Gentlemen of Verona</i> onward till Prospero\n        breaks his staff, buries it certain fathoms in the earth and drowns his\n        book. It doubles itself in the middle of his life, reflects itself in\n        another, repeats itself, protasis, epitasis, catastasis, catastrophe.\n        It repeats itself again when he is near the grave, when his married\n        daughter Susan, chip of the old block, is accused of adultery. But it\n        was the original sin that darkened his understanding, weakened his will\n        and left in him a strong inclination to evil. The words are those of\n        my lords bishops of Maynooth: an original sin and, like original sin,\n        <span data-edition=\"ed1932\" data-page=\"190\">  </span>committed by another in whose sin he too has sinned.

Buttoning it down, his chin lifted, he saw the\n        image of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, beside the two puckers. <span data-edition=\"ed1932\" data-page=\"225\"></span>One\n        of them mots <Annotation annotationId=\"090012brogue\">that do be</Annotation> in the packets of fags Stoer smokes that his old\n        fellow welted hell out of him for one time he found out.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Master Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on.

The viceroy was most cordially greeted on his way through the\n        metropolis. At Bloody bridge Mr Thomas Kernan beyond the river greeted\n        him vainly from afar Between Queen's and Whitworth bridges lord Dudley's\n        viceregal carriages passed and were unsaluted by Mr Dudley White, B.\n        L., M.

The Right Honourable\n        William Humble, earl of Dudley, G. C. V.

Over against Dame gate\n        Tom Rochford and Nosey Flynn watched the approach of the cavalcade. Tom\n        Rochford, seeing the eyes of lady Dudley fixed on him, took his thumbs\n        quickly out of the pockets <span data-edition=\"ed1932\" data-page=\"227\"></span>of his claret waistcoat and doffed his cap to\n        her. A charming <i>soubrette,</i> great Marie Kendall, with dauby cheeks and\n        lifted skirt smiled daubily from her poster upon William Humble, earl\n        of Dudley, and upon lieutenantcolonel H.

In Fownes's\n        street Dilly Dedalus, straining her sight upward from Chardenal's first\n        French primer, saw sunshades spanned and wheelspokes spinning in the\n        glare. John Henry Menton, filling the doorway of Commercial Buildings,\n        stared from winebig oyster eyes, holding a fat gold hunter watch not\n        looked at in his fat left hand not feeling it. <Annotation annotationId=\"100001kingbilly\">Where the foreleg of King\n        Billy's horse pawed the air Mrs Breen plucked her hastening husband\n        back from under the hoofs of the outriders.</Annotation> She shouted in his ear the\n        tidings. Understanding, he shifted his tomes to his left breast\n        and saluted the second carriage. The honourable Gerald Ward A.D.C.,\n        agreeably surprised, made haste to reply. At Ponsonby's corner a jaded\n        white flagon H. halted and four tallhatted white flagons halted behind\n        him, E.L.Y'S, while outriders pranced past and carriages. Opposite\n        Pigott's music warerooms Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &amp;c,\n        gaily apparelled, gravely walked, outpassed by a viceroy and unobserved.\n        By the provost's wall came jauntily Blazes Boylan, stepping in tan <span data-edition=\"ed1961\" data-page=\"253\"></span>shoes\n        and <Annotation annotationId=\"100005skyblueclocks\">socks with skyblue clocks</Annotation> to the refrain of <Annotation annotationId=\"100004yorkshiregirl\"><i>My girl's a Yorkshire\n        girl</i></Annotation>.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Blazes Boylan presented to the leaders' skyblue frontlets and high\n        action a skyblue tie, a widebrimmed straw hat at a rakish angle and a\n        suit of indigo serge.

As the glossy horses pranced by Merrion square Master\n        Patrick Aloysius Dignam, waiting, saw salutes being given to the gent\n        with the topper and raised also his new black cap with fingers greased\n        by porksteak paper. His collar too sprang up. The viceroy, on his way to\n        inaugurate the Mirus bazaar in aid of funds for Mercer's hospital,\n        drove with his following towards Lower Mount street. He passed a blind\n        stripling opposite Broadbent's.

It was then queried whether there\n        were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was:\n        <i>We greet you, friends of earth, who are still in the body. Mind C.

All the\n        delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest\n        possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which\n        they had been called upon to witness.

Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricated from\n        underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his legal\n        adviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles <span data-edition=\"ed1932\" data-page=\"277\"> </span>secreted in his\n        thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the\n        pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their\n        senses.

He announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough\n        which so many have tried (unsuccessfully) to imitate{\" \"}—{\" \"}short,\n        painstaking yet withal so characteristic of the man. The arrival of the\n        worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the\n        huge concourse, the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in\n        their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates\n        cheered vociferously in a medley of cries, <i>hoch, banzai, eljen, zivio,\n        chinchin, polla kronia, hiphip, vive, Allah</i>, amid which the ringing\n        <i>evviva</i> of the delegate of the land of song (a high double F recalling\n        those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch Catalani beglamoured\n        our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily distinguishable. It was exactly\n        seventeen o'clock. The signal for prayer was then promptly given by\n        megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared, \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1922\" data-page=\"295\"> </span>\n        the commendatore's\n        patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the possession of his family\n        since the revolution of Rienzi, being removed by his medical adviser\n        in attendance, Dr Pippi. The learned prelate who administered the last\n        comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when about to pay the death\n        penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater, his\n        cassock above \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1939\" data-page=\"224\"> </span>\n        his hoary head, and offered up to the throne of grace\n        fervent prayers of <span data-edition=\"ed1961\" data-page=\"308\"> </span>supplication. Hard by the block stood the grim figure\n        of the executioner, his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot\n        with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered\n        furiously. As he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his\n        horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated\n        in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the\n        admirers of his fell but necessary office. On a handsome mahogany table\n        near him were neatly arranged the <span data-edition=\"ed1986\" data-page=\"253\"> </span>quartering knife, the various\n        finely tempered disembowelling appliances (specially supplied by the\n        worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round and Sons, Sheffield),\n        a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum, colon,\n        blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two\n        commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the\n        most precious victim.

Quite an excellent repast consisting of\n        rashers and eggs, fried steak and onions, done to a nicety, delicious\n        hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided\n        by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the\n        tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced\n        the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he,\n        with an abnegation rare in these our times, rose nobly to the occasion\n        and expressed the dying wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal\n        should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and\n        indigent roomkeepers' association as a token of his regard and esteem.\n        The <i>nec</i> and <i>non plus ultra</i> of emotion were reached when the blushing\n        bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders\n        and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be\n        launched into eternity for her sake. The hero folded her willowy form in\n        a loving embrace murmuring fondly <i>Sheila, my own</i>. Encouraged by\n        this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various\n        suitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb\n        permitted her ardour to reach. She swore to him as they mingled the salt\n        streams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory, that she\n        would never \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1922\" data-page=\"296\"> </span>\n        forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his\n        lips as if he were but going to a hurling match in Clonturk park.

That monster audience simply\n        rocked with delight. But anon they were overcome with grief and clasped\n        their hands for the last time. A fresh torrent of tears burst from their\n        lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people, touched to the inmost\n        core, broke into heartrending sobs, not the least affected being the\n        aged prebendary himself. Big strong men, officers of the peace and\n        genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary, were making frank use of\n        their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye\n        in that record assemblage. A most romantic incident occurred when a\n        handsome young Oxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the fair\n        sex, stepped forward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook\n        and genealogical tree, solicited the hand of the hapless young lady,\n        requesting her to name the day, and was accepted on the spot. Every lady\n        in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1939\" data-page=\"225\"> </span>\n        occasion\n        in the shape of a skull and <span data-edition=\"ed1986\" data-page=\"254\"> </span><span data-edition=\"ed1932\" data-page=\"279\"> </span>crossbones brooch, a timely and generous\n        act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the gallant young\n        Oxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the most timehonoured names\n        in Albion's history) placed on the finger of his blushing <i>fiancée</i> an\n        expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a\n        fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds. Nay, even the\n        stern provostmarshal, lieutenantcolonel Tomkin-Maxwell ffrenchmullan\n        Tomlinson, who presided on the sad occasion, he who had blown a\n        considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching,\n        could not now restrain his natural emotion. With his mailed gauntlet\n        he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard, by those privileged\n        burghers who happened to be in his immediate <i>entourage,</i> to murmur to\n        himself in a faltering undertone:\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        —{\" \"}God blimey if she aint a clinker, that there bleeding tart.

And <span data-edition=\"ed1932\" data-page=\"313\"> </span>you,\n        Jacky, for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand. Wait till I\n        catch you for that.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        His eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for their\n        big sister's word was law with the twins. And in a sad plight he was after his misadventure. His little man-o'-war top and unmentionables\n        were full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothing\n        over life's tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand was to\n        be seen on his smart little suit. Still the blue eyes were glistening\n        with hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness and\n        shook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and said if she was near him\n        she wouldn't be far from him, her eyes dancing in admonition.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        —{\" \"}Nasty bold Jacky! she cried.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        She put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly:\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        —{\" \"}What's your name?

Gerty is\n        Tommy's sweetheart.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        —{\" \"}Nao, Tommy said on the verge of tears.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Cissy's quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to\n        Edy Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentlemen\n        couldn't see and to mind he didn't wet his new tan shoes.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        But who was Gerty?\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Gerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions, lost in thought,\n        gazing far away into the distance was, in very truth, as fair a <span data-edition=\"ed1986\" data-page=\"285\"> </span>specimen\n        of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see. She was pronounced\n        beautiful by all who knew her though, as folks often said, she was\n        more a Giltrap than a MacDowell. Her figure was slight and graceful,\n        inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking\n        of late had done her a world of good much better than the Widow Welch's\n        female pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to\n        get and that tired feeling. The waxen pallor of her face was almost\n        spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine\n        Cupid's bow, Greekly perfect. Her hands were of finely veined alabaster\n        with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments\n        could make them though it was not true that <span data-edition=\"ed1932\" data-page=\"314\"> </span>she used to wear kid gloves\n        in bed or take a milk footbath either. Bertha Supple told that once to\n        Edy Boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black out at daggers drawn\n        with Gerty (the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1939\" data-page=\"252\"> </span>\n        time to\n        time like the rest of mortals) and she told her not to let on whatever\n        she did that it was her that told her or she'd never speak to her\n        again. No. Honour where honour is due. There was an innate refinement,\n        a languid queenly <i>hauteur</i> about Gerty which was unmistakably evidenced\n        in her delicate hands and higharched instep. Had kind fate but willed\n        her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in her own right and had\n        she only received the benefit of a good education Gerty MacDowell might\n        easily have held her own beside any lady in the land and have seen\n        herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician suitors\n        at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1922\" data-page=\"333\"> </span>\n        her. Mayhap it was this, the love that might have been, that lent to her\n        softlyfeatured face at whiles a look, tense with suppressed meaning,\n        that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes, a charm\n        few could resist. \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1961\" data-page=\"348\"> </span>Why have women such eyes of witchery? Gerty's were of\n        the bluest Irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive\n        brows. Time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive. It\n        was Madame Vera Verity, directress of the Woman Beautiful page of the\n        Princess Novelette, who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which\n        gave that haunting expression to the eyes, so becoming in leaders\n        of fashion, and she had never regretted it. Then there was blushing\n        scientifically cured and how to be tall increase your height and you\n        have a beautiful face but your nose? That would suit Mrs Dignam because\n        she had a button one. But Gerty's crowning glory was her wealth of\n        wonderful hair. It was dark brown with a natural wave in it. She had cut\n        it that very morning on account of the new moon and it nestled about\n        her pretty head in a profusion of luxuriant clusters and pared her nails\n        too, Thursday for wealth. And just now at Edy's words as a telltale\n        flush, delicate as the faintest rosebloom, crept into her cheeks she\n        looked so lovely in her sweet girlish shyness that of a surety God's\n        fair land of Ireland did not hold her equal.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        For an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes. She\n        was about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue.\n        Inclination prompted her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent.\n        The pretty lips <span data-edition=\"ed1986\" data-page=\"286\"> </span>pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into\n        a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young May\n        morning. She knew right well, no-one better, what made squinty <span data-edition=\"ed1932\" data-page=\"315\"> </span>Edy\n        say that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a\n        lovers' quarrel. As per usual somebody's nose was out of joint about the\n        boy that had the bicycle always riding up\n        and down in front of her window. Only now his father kept him in in the\n        evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was\n        on and he was going to Trinity college to study for a doctor when\n        he left <Annotation annotationId=\"050020highschool\">the high school</Annotation> like his brother W. E. Wylie who was racing\n        in the bicycle races in Trinity college university. Little recked he\n        perhaps for what she felt, that dull aching void in her heart sometimes,\n        piercing to the core. Yet he was young and perchance he might learn\n        to love her in time. They were protestants in his family and of course\n        Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the Blessed Virgin and then\n        Saint Joseph. But he was undeniably handsome with an exquisite nose and\n        he was what he looked, every inch a gentleman, the shape of his head too\n        at the back without his cap on \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1961\" data-page=\"349\"> </span>that she would know anywhere \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1922\" data-page=\"334\"> </span>\n        something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his\n        hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes\n        and besides they were both of a size and that was why \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1939\" data-page=\"253\"> </span>\n        Edy\n        Boardman thought she was so frightfully clever because he didn't go and\n        ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of\n        Dame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be\n        out. A neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes (because it\n        was expected in the <i>Lady's Pictorial</i> that electric blue would be worn)\n        with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket (in\n        which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her\n        favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit) and a navy\n        threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure\n        to perfection. She wore a coquettish little love of a hat of wideleaved\n        nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue chenille and\n        at the side a butterfly bow to tone. All Tuesday week afternoon\n        she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she found what she\n        wanted at Clery's summer sales, the very it, slightly shopsoiled but you\n        would never notice, seven fingers two and a penny. She did it up all by\n        herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on then, smiling at the\n        lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her! And when she put\n        it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that that would take the\n        shine out of some people she knew. Her shoes were the newest thing in\n        footwear (Edy Boardman prided herself that she was very <i>petite</i> but she\n        never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell, a five, and never would ash,\n        oak <span data-edition=\"ed1932\" data-page=\"316\"> </span>or elm) with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle at\n        her higharched instep. Her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect\n        proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of\n        her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and\n        wide <span data-edition=\"ed1986\" data-page=\"287\"> </span>garter tops. As for undies they were Gerty's chief care and who\n        that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen (though\n        Gerty would never see seventeen again) can find it in his heart to\n        blame her? She had four dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery,\n        three garments and nighties extra, and each set slotted with different\n        coloured ribbons, rosepink, pale blue, mauve and peagreen, and she aired\n        them herself and blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed\n        them and she had a \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1961\" data-page=\"350\"> </span>brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldn't\n        trust those washerwomen as far as she'd see them scorching the things.\n        She was wearing the blue for luck, hoping against hope, her own colour\n        and the lucky colour too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1922\" data-page=\"335\"> </span>\n        her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his father\n        brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because\n        she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that\n        morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that\n        was for luck and lovers' meetings if you put those things on inside\n        out so long as it\n        wasn't of a Friday.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        And yet and yet! That strained look on her face! A gnawing sorrow is\n        there all the time. Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give\n        worlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where,\n        giving way to tears, she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup\n        feelings. Though not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before\n        the mirror. You are lovely, Gerty, it said. The paly light of evening\n        falls upon a face infinitely sad and wistful. Gerty MacDowell yearns\n        in vain. Yes, she had known from the first that her daydream of a\n        marriage has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy\n        Wylie T. C. D. (because the one who married the elder brother would be\n        Mrs Wylie) and in the fashionable intelligence \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1939\" data-page=\"254\"> </span>\n        Mrs Gertrude Wylie was\n        wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox\n        was not to be. He was too young to understand. He would not believe in\n        love, a woman's birthright. The night of the party long ago in Stoers'\n        (he was still in short trousers) when they were alone and he stole\n        an arm round her waist she went white to the very lips. He called her\n        little one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss (the\n        first!) but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from\n        the room with a remark about refreshments. Impetuous fellow! Strength <span data-edition=\"ed1932\" data-page=\"317\"> </span>of\n        character had never been Reggy Wylie's strong point and he who would\n        woo and win Gerty MacDowell must be a man among men. But waiting, always\n        waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be over. No\n        prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous love at her\n        feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who had not found\n        his ideal, perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey, and who would\n        understand, take her in his sheltering arms, strain her to him in all\n        the strength of his deep passionate nature and \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1961\" data-page=\"351\"> </span>comfort her with a long\n        long kiss. It would be like heaven. For such a one she yearns this balmy\n        <span data-edition=\"ed1986\" data-page=\"288\"> </span>summer eve. With all the heart of her she longs to be his only, his\n        affianced bride for riches for poor, in sickness in health, till death\n        us two part, from this to this day forward.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        And while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was\n        just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1922\" data-page=\"336\"> </span>\n        his little wife to be. Then they could talk about her till they went blue in\n        the face, Bertha Supple too, and Edy, the spitfire, because she would\n        be twentytwo in November. She would care for him with creature comforts\n        too for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that\n        feeling of hominess. Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and\n        queen Ann's pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions\n        from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire, dredge\n        in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction,\n        then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though\n        she didn't like the eating part when there were any people that made her\n        shy and often she wondered why you couldn't eat something poetical like\n        violets or roses and they would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom\n        with pictures and engravings and the photograph of grandpapa Giltrap's\n        lovely dog Garryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz\n        covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in Clery's summer\n        jumble sales like they have in rich houses. He would be tall with\n        broad shoulders (she had always admired tall men for a husband) with\n        glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping moustache\n        and they would go on the continent for their honeymoon (three wonderful\n        weeks!) and then, when they settled down in a nice snug and cosy little\n        homely house, every morning they would both have brekky, simple but\n        perfectly served, for their own two selves and before he went out to\n        business he would give his dear little wifey a good hearty hug and gaze\n        for a moment deep down into her eyes.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Edy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she\n        buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him <span data-edition=\"ed1932\" data-page=\"318\"> </span>to run off\n        and play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight. But Tommy said\n        he wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with the\n        ball and if he took it there'd be wigs on the green but Tommy said \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1961\" data-page=\"352\"> </span>it\n        was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground, if\n        you please. The temper of him! O, he was a man \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1939\" data-page=\"255\"> </span>\n        already was little Tommy\n        Caffrey since he was out of pinnies. Edy told him no, no and to be off\n        now with him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        —{\" \"}You're not my sister, naughty Tommy said. It's my ball.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        But Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up, look up high at her\n        finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and\n        Tommy after it in full career, having won the day.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        —{\" \"}Anything for a quiet life, laughed Ciss.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        And she tickled tiny tot's two cheeks to make him forget and played here's \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1922\" data-page=\"337\"> </span>\n        <Annotation annotationId=\"060033corporation\">the lord mayor, here's his two horses, here's his gingerbread\n        carriage</Annotation> <span data-edition=\"ed1986\" data-page=\"289\"> </span>and here he walks in, chinchopper, chinchopper, chinchopper\n        chin. But Edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way\n        like that from everyone always petting him.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        —{\" \"}I'd like to give him something, she said, so I would, where I won't\n        say.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        —{\" \"}On the beeoteetom, laughed Cissy merrily.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Gerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissy\n        saying an unladylike thing like that out loud she'd be ashamed of her\n        life to say, flushing a deep rosy red, and Edy Boardman said she was\n        sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said. But not a pin cared\n        Ciss.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        —{\" \"}Let him! she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of\n        her nose.

You had to laugh at her sometimes.\n        For instance when she asked you would you have some more Chinese tea and\n        jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men's faces on her\n        nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to go\n        where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the Miss\n        White. That was just like Cissycums. O, and will you ever forget the\n        evening she dressed up in her father's suit and hat and the burned cork\n        moustache and walked down Tritonville road, smoking a cigarette. There\n        was none to come up to her for fun. But she was sincerity itself, one of\n        the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made, not one of your twofaced\n        things, too sweet to be wholesome.\n      </p>\n      <span data-edition=\"ed1932\" data-page=\"319\"> </span>\n      <p>\n        And then there came out upon the air the sound of voices \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1961\" data-page=\"353\"> </span>and the pealing\n        anthem of the organ. It was the men's temperance retreat conducted\n        by the missioner, the reverend John Hughes S. J., rosary, sermon and\n        benediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament. They were there gathered\n        together without distinction of social class (and a most edifying\n        spectacle it was to see) in that simple fane beside the waves, after the\n        storms of this weary world, kneeling before the feet of the immaculate,\n        reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loreto, beseeching her to intercede\n        for them, the old familiar words, holy Mary, holy virgin of virgins. How\n        sad to poor Gerty's ears! Had her father only avoided the clutches of\n        the demon drink, by <Annotation annotationId=\"060010fathermathew\">taking the pledge</Annotation> or those powders the drink habit\n        cured in Pearson's Weekly, she might now be rolling in her carriage,\n        second to none. Over and over had she told herself that as she mused by\n        the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp because she hated \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1922\" data-page=\"338\"> </span>\n        two lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window dreamily by the hour at\n        the rain falling on the rusty bucket, thinking. But that vile decoction\n        which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cast its shadow over her\n        childhood days. Nay, she had even witnessed in the home circle <Annotation annotationId=\"050049comehometoma\">deeds of\n        violence caused by intemperance</Annotation> and had seen her own father, a prey to\n        the fumes of intoxication, forget himself completely for if there was\n        one thing of all things that Gerty knew \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1939\" data-page=\"256\"> </span>\n        it was that the man who lifts\n        his hand to a woman save in the way of kindness, deserves to be branded\n        as the lowest of the low.\n      </p>\n      <span data-edition=\"ed1986\" data-page=\"290\"> </span>\n      <p>\n        And still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerful,\n        Virgin most merciful. And Gerty, wrapt in thought, scarce saw or heard\n        her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman\n        <Annotation annotationId=\"070002sandymounttrams\">off Sandymount green</Annotation> that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like\n        himself passing along the strand taking a short walk. You never saw him\n        any way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a\n        father because he was too old or something or on account of his face\n        (it was a palpable case of Doctor Fell) or his carbuncly nose with the\n        pimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose. Poor\n        father! With all his faults she loved him still when he sang <i>Tell me,\n        Mary, how to woo thee</i> or <i>My love and cottage near Rochelle</i> and they\n        had stewed <Annotation annotationId=\"030080cockles\">cockles</Annotation> and lettuce with Lazenby's salad dressing for\n        supper and when he sang <i>The moon hath raised</i> with Mr Dignam that\n        died suddenly and was buried, God have mercy on him, from a stroke. Her\n        mother's birthday that was and Charley was home \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1961\" data-page=\"354\"> </span>on his holidays and Tom\n        and Mr Dignam and Mrs and Patsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have\n        had a group taken. No-one would have thought the end was so <span data-edition=\"ed1932\" data-page=\"320\"> </span>near. Now he\n        was laid to rest. And her mother said to him to let that be a warning to\n        him for the rest of his days and he couldn't even go to the funeral on\n        account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him the\n        letters and samples from his office about Catesby's cork lino, artistic,\n        standard designs, fit for a palace, gives tiptop wear and always bright\n        and cheery in the home.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        A sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the\n        house, a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in\n        gold. And when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was\n        it rubbed on the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn't\n        like her mother taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single\n        thing they ever had words about, taking snuff. Everyone thought the\n        world of her for her gentle ways. It was Gerty who turned off the gas at\n        the main every night and it was Gerty \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1922\" data-page=\"339\"> </span>\n        who tacked up on the wall of that\n        place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime Mr\n        Tunney the grocer's christmas almanac, the picture of halcyon days\n        where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a\n        threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with\n        oldtime chivalry through her lattice window. You could see there was a\n        story behind it. The colours were done something lovely. She was in\n        a soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in\n        chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat. She often looked at them\n        dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own\n        arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back\n        and thought about those times because she had found out in Walker's\n        pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrap about the\n        halcyon days what they meant.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion,\n        till at last Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was\n        no getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he\n        could down <span data-edition=\"ed1986\" data-page=\"291\"> </span>towards the seaweedy rocks. Needless to say poor Tommy was\n        not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was\n        sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted\n        the ball. Our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and\n        to avoid trouble Cissy Caffrey called to the <span data-edition=\"ed1961\" data-page=\"355\"> </span>gentleman to throw it \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1939\" data-page=\"257\"> </span>\n        to her please. The gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw\n        it up the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the slope and\n        stopped right under Gerty's skirt near the little pool by the rock. The\n        twins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it away and\n        let them fight for it so Gerty drew back her foot but she wished their\n        <span data-edition=\"ed1932\" data-page=\"321\"> </span>stupid ball hadn't come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she\n        missed and Edy and Cissy laughed.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        —{\" \"}If you fail try again, Edy Boardman said.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Gerty smiled assent and bit her lip. A delicate pink crept into her\n        pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted\n        her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a\n        jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down\n        towards the shingle. Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw\n        attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking. She felt the\n        warm flush, a danger signal always with Gerty MacDowell, surging and\n        flaming into her cheeks. Till then they had only exchanged glances of\n        the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she ventured a\n        look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the twilight, wan\n        and strangely drawn, seemed to her the saddest she had ever seen.\n      </p>\n      <span data-edition=\"ed1922\" data-page=\"340\"> </span>\n      <p>\n        Through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted\n        and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of\n        original sin, spiritual vessel, pray for us, honourable vessel, pray\n        for us, vessel of singular devotion, pray for us, mystical rose. And\n        careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many\n        who had erred and wandered, their eyes wet with contrition but for all\n        that bright with hope for the reverend father Hughes had told\n        them what the great saint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary, the\n        most pious Virgin's intercessory power that it was not recorded in any\n        age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned\n        by her.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of\n        childhood are but as fleeting summer showers. Cissy played with\n        baby Boardman till he crowed with glee, clapping baby hands in air. Peep\n        she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was Cissy\n        gone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ah! and, my word,\n        didn't the little chap enjoy that! And then she told him to say papa.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        —{\" \"}Say papa, baby.

Of course his infant majesty was most\n        obstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it:\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        —{\" \"}Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        And two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks. It was all\n        no use soothering him with no, nono, baby, no and telling him about the\n        geegee and where was the puffpuff but Ciss, always readywitted, gave\n        him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was\n        quickly appeased.\n      </p>\n      <span data-edition=\"ed1939\" data-page=\"258\"> </span>\n      <p>\n        Gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out\n        of that and not get on her nerves, no hour to be out, and the little\n        brats of twins. She gazed out towards the distant sea. It was like the\n        paintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured\n        chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out, the\n        evening and the clouds coming \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1922\" data-page=\"341\"> </span>\n        out and the Bailey light on Howth and to\n        hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they burned\n        in the church like a kind of waft. And while she gazed her heart went\n        pitapat. Yes, it was her he was looking at, and there was meaning in his\n        look. His eyes burned into her as though they would search her through\n        and through, read her very soul. Wonderful eyes they were, superbly\n        expressive, but could you trust them? People were so queer. She could\n        see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face that he\n        was a foreigner, the image of <Annotation annotationId=\"130003martinharvey\">the photo she had of Martin Harvey, the\n        matinee idol</Annotation>, only for <Annotation annotationId=\"040055moustachecup\">the moustache</Annotation> which she preferred because she\n        wasn't stagestruck like Winny Rippingham that wanted they two to always\n        dress the same on account of a play but she could not see whether he had\n        an aquiline nose or a slightly <i>retroussé</i> from where he was sitting.\n        He was in deep mourning, she could see that, and the story of a haunting\n        sorrow was written on his face. She would have given worlds to know what\n        it was. He was looking up so intently, so still, and he saw her kick the\n        ball and perhaps he could see <span data-edition=\"ed1961\" data-page=\"357\"> </span>the bright steel buckles of her shoes if\n        she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down. She was glad\n        that something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking\n        Reggy Wylie might be out but that was far away. Here was that of which\n        she had so often dreamed. It was he who mattered and there was joy on\n        her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he\n        was like no-one else. The very heart of the girlwoman went out to him,\n        her dreamhusband, because she knew on the instant it was him. If he had\n        suffered, more sinned against than sinning, or even, even, if he had\n        been himself a sinner, a wicked man, she cared not. Even if he was a\n        protestant or methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved\n        <span data-edition=\"ed1932\" data-page=\"323\"> </span>her. There were wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm. She was a\n        womanly woman not like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known,\n        those cyclists showing off what they hadn't got and she just yearned to\n        know all, to forgive all if <span data-edition=\"ed1986\" data-page=\"293\"> </span>she could make him fall in love with her,\n        make him forget the memory of the past. Then mayhap he would embrace her\n        gently, like a real man, crushing her soft body to him, and love her,\n        his ownest girlie, for herself alone.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Refuge of sinners. Comfortress of the afflicted. <i>Ora pro nobis</i>. Well\n        has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy\n        can never be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge\n        for the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced\n        her own heart. Gerty could picture the whole scene in the church, the\n        stained glass windows lighted up, the candles, the flowers and the blue\n        banners of the blessed Virgin's sodality and <Annotation annotationId=\"040027conroy\">Father</Annotation> \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1922\" data-page=\"342\"> </span>\n        <Annotation annotationId=\"040027conroy\">Conroy</Annotation> was helping\n        Canon O'Hanlon at the altar, carrying things in and out with his eyes\n        cast down. He looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet\n        and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever\n        she became a Dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come to\n        the convent for the novena of Saint Dominic. He told her that time when\n        she told him about that in confession, crimsoning up to the roots of her\n        hair for fear he could see, not to be troubled because that was only the\n        voice of nature and we were all subject to nature's laws, \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1939\" data-page=\"259\"> </span>\n        he said, in\n        this life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of\n        woman instituted by God, he said, and that Our Blessed Lady herself said\n        to the archangel Gabriel be it done unto me according to Thy Word. He\n        <span data-edition=\"ed1961\" data-page=\"358\"> </span>was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and thought could\n        she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design for him as a\n        present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the mantelpiece\n        white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little house to tell\n        the time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hours'\n        adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or\n        perhaps an album of illuminated views of Dublin or some place.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky\n        threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it. Little\n        monkeys common as ditchwater. Someone ought to take them and give them\n        a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places, the both of\n        them. And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because they\n        were afraid  <Annotation annotationId=\"010125hightide\">the tide might come in on them and be drowned</Annotation>.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        —{\" \"}Jacky! Tommy!\n      </p>\n      <span data-edition=\"ed1932\" data-page=\"324\"> </span>\n      <p>\n        Not they! What a great notion they had! So Cissy said it was the very\n        last time she'd ever bring them out. She jumped up and called them and\n        she ran down the slope past him, tossing her hair behind her which had\n        a good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the\n        thingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldn't get it to grow\n        long because it wasn't natural so she could just go and throw her hat at\n        it. She ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn't rip up\n        her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot\n        of the tomboy about Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever\n        she thought she had a good opportunity to show and just because she was\n        a good runner she ran like <span data-edition=\"ed1986\" data-page=\"294\"> </span>that so that he could see all the end of her\n        petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible. It\n        would have served her just right if she had tripped up over something\n        accidentally on purpose with her high crooked French heels on her to\n        make her look tall and \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1922\" data-page=\"343\"> </span>\n        got a fine tumble. <i>Tableau!</i> That would have\n        been a very charming expose for a gentleman like that to witness.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Queen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints,\n        they prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy handed\n        the thurible to Canon O'Hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the\n        Blessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she was\n        itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didn't\n        because <span data-edition=\"ed1961\" data-page=\"359\"> </span>she thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger\n        mistake in all her life because Gerty could see without looking that\n        he never took his eyes off of her and then Canon O'Hanlon handed the\n        thurible back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the Blessed\n        Sacrament and the choir began to sing <i>Tantum ergo</i> and she just\n        swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to\n        the <i>Tantumer gosa cramen tum</i>. Three and eleven she paid for those\n        stockings in Sparrow's of George's street on the Tuesday, no the Monday\n        before Easter and there wasn't a brack on them and that was what he\n        was looking at, transparent, and not at her insignificant ones that had\n        neither shape nor form (the cheek of her!) because he had eyes in his\n        head to see the difference for himself.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with\n        her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a\n        streel tugging the two \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1939\" data-page=\"260\"> </span>\n        kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only\n        a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat\n        hanging like a caricature. Gerty just took off her hat for a moment to\n        settle her hair and a prettier, a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was\n        never seen on a girl's shoulders, a radiant little vision, in sooth,\n        almost maddening <span data-edition=\"ed1932\" data-page=\"325\"> </span>in its sweetness. You would have to travel many a long\n        mile before you found a head of hair the like of that. She could almost\n        see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her\n        tingling in every nerve. She put on her hat so that she could see from\n        underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath\n        caught as she caught the expression in his eyes. He was eying her as a\n        snake eyes its prey. Her woman's instinct told her that she had raised\n        the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat\n        to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Edy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty,\n        half smiling, with her specs like an old maid, pretending to nurse the\n        baby. Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why\n        no-one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of\n        hers. And she said to Gerty:\n      </p>\n      <span data-edition=\"ed1922\" data-page=\"344\"> </span>\n      <p>\n        —{\" \"}A penny for your thoughts.\n      </p>\n      <span data-edition=\"ed1986\" data-page=\"295\"> </span>\n      <p>\n        —{\" \"}What? replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth. I\n        was only wondering was it late.\n      </p>\n      <span data-edition=\"ed1961\" data-page=\"360\"> </span>\n      <p>\n        Because she wished to goodness they'd take the snottynosed twins and\n        their babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just\n        gave a gentle hint about its being late. And when Cissy came up Edy\n        asked her the time and Miss Cissy, as glib as you like, said it was half\n        past kissing time, time to kiss again. But Edy wanted to know because\n        they were told to be in early.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        —{\" \"}Wait, said Cissy, I'll ask my uncle Peter over there what's the\n        time by his conundrum.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        So over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his\n        hand out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with his\n        watchchain, looking at the church. Passionate nature though he was\n        Gerty could see that he had enormous control over himself. One moment he\n        had been there, fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze, and the\n        next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol expressed\n        in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Cissy said to excuse her would he mind telling her what was the\n        right time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch, listening to it\n        and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his\n        watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the\n        sun was set. His voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in\n        measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones.\n        Cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said\n        his waterworks were out of order.\n      </p>\n      <span data-edition=\"ed1932\" data-page=\"326\"> </span>\n      <p>\n        Then they sang the second verse of the <i>Tantum ergo</i> and Canon O'Hanlon\n        got up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down and he told\n        Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the\n        flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and she could\n        see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and she\n        swung her leg more in and out in time. It was getting darker but he\n        could see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch\n        or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands\n        back into his pockets. She felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over\n        her \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1939\" data-page=\"261\"> </span>\n        and she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against\n        her stays that that thing must be coming on because the last time too\n        was when she clipped her hair on account of the moon. His dark eyes\n        fixed themselves on her again drinking in her every contour, \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1922\" data-page=\"345\"> </span>\n        literally worshipping at her shrine. If ever there <span data-edition=\"ed1961\" data-page=\"361\"> </span>was undisguised admiration in a\n        man's passionate gaze it was there plain to be seen on that man's face.\n        It is for you, Gertrude MacDowell, and you know it.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gerty\n        noticed that that little hint she gave had the desired effect\n        because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place\n        to push up the pushcar and Cissy took off the twins' caps and tidied\n        their hair to make <span data-edition=\"ed1986\" data-page=\"296\"> </span>herself attractive of course and Canon O'Hanlon stood\n        up with his cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed him the\n        card to read off and he read out <i>Panem de coelo praestitisti eis</i> and\n        Edy and Cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her\n        but Gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered\n        with scathing politeness when Edy asked her was she heartbroken about\n        her best boy throwing her over. Gerty winced sharply. A brief cold blaze\n        shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn immeasurable. It hurt. O\n        yes, it cut deep because Edy had her own quiet way of saying things\n        like that she knew would wound like the confounded little cat she was.\n        Gerty's lips parted swiftly to frame the word but she fought back\n        the sob that rose to her throat, so slim, so flawless, so beautifully\n        moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of. She had loved him\n        better than he knew. Lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex\n        he would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant\n        there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears. Their eyes were\n        probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back in\n        sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        —{\" \"}O, responded Gerty, quick as lightning, laughing, and the proud head\n        flashed up. I can throw my cap at who I like because it's leap year.\n      </p>\n      <span data-edition=\"ed1932\" data-page=\"327\"> </span>\n      <p>\n        Her words rang out crystalclear, more musical than the cooing of the\n        ringdove, but they cut the silence icily. There was that in her young\n        voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with. As\n        for Mr Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck\n        him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as\n        much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a dozen\n        pieces. And if ever after he dared to presume she could give him one\n        look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot. Miss\n        puny little Edy's countenance fell to no <span data-edition=\"ed1961\" data-page=\"362\"> </span>slight extent and Gerty could\n        see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering\n        rage though she hid it, the little kinnatt, because that shaft had\n        struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was\n        something aloof, apart, in another sphere, that she was not of them \n        and there \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1922\" data-page=\"346\"> </span>\n        was somebody else too that knew it and saw it\n        so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Edy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked in\n        the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the\n        sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior. And Cissy told him\n        too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby\n        looked just too ducky, laughing up out of his gleeful eyes, and Cissy\n        poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby, without as\n        much as by your leave, sent up his compliments to all and sundry on to\n        his brandnew dribbling bib.\n      </p>\n      <span data-edition=\"ed1939\" data-page=\"262\"> </span>\n      <p>\n        —{\" \"}O my!

And she could see far away the lights of\n        the lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of\n        paints because it was easier than to make a man and soon <span data-edition=\"ed1932\" data-page=\"328\"> </span>the lamplighter\n        would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along\n        by shady Tritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the\n        lamp near her window where Reggy Wylie used to turn his freewheel like\n        she read in that book <i>The Lamplighter</i> by Miss Cummins, author of\n        <i>Mabel Vaughan</i> and other tales. For Gerty had her dreams that no-one\n        knew <span data-edition=\"ed1961\" data-page=\"363\"> </span>of. She loved to read poetry and when she got a keepsake from\n        Bertha Supple of that lovely confession album with the coralpink cover\n        to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of her toilettable\n        which, though it did not err on the side of luxury, was scrupulously\n        neat and clean. It was there she kept her girlish treasure trove, the\n        tortoiseshell combs, her child of Mary badge, the whiterose scent, the\n        eyebrowleine, her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change\n        when her things came home from the wash and there were some beautiful\n        thoughts written in it <Annotation annotationId=\"020080mauve\">in violet ink</Annotation> that she bought in Hely's \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1922\" data-page=\"347\"> </span>\n        of Dame Street for she felt that she too could write poetry if she could only\n        express herself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that\n        she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the\n        potherbs. <i>Art thou real, my ideal?</i> it was called by Louis J. Walsh,\n        Magherafelt, and after there was something about <i>twilight, wilt thou\n        ever?</i> and ofttimes the beauty of poetry, so sad in its transient\n        loveliness, had misted her eyes with silent tears that\n        the years were slipping by for her, one by one, and but for that one\n        shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an\n        accident coming down Dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it.\n        But it must end, she felt. If she saw that magic lure in his eyes there\n        would be no holding back for her. Love laughs at locksmiths. She\n        would make the great sacrifice. Her every effort would be to share his\n        thoughts. Dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his\n        days with happiness. There was the allimportant question and she was\n        dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife\n        or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land\n        of song had to have her put into a madhouse, cruel only to be kind.\n        But even if{\" \"}—{\" \"}what then? Would it make a very great difference? From\n        everything in the least indelicate her <span data-edition=\"ed1986\" data-page=\"298\"> </span>finebred nature instinctively\n        recoiled. She loathed that sort of person, the fallen women off the\n        accommodation walk beside the Dodder that went with the soldiers and\n        coarse men with no respect for a girl's honour, degrading the sex and\n        being taken up to the police station.

It's the bazaar fireworks.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        But Gerty was adamant. She had no intention of being at their beck and\n        call. If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could\n        see from where she was. The eyes that were fastened upon her set her\n        pulses tingling. She looked at him a moment, meeting his glance, and\n        a light broke in upon her. Whitehot passion was in that face, passion\n        silent as the grave, and it had made her his. At last they were left\n        alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he could\n        be trusted to the death, steadfast, a sterling man, a man of inflexible\n        honour to his fingertips. His hands and face were working and a tremour\n        went over her. She leaned back far to look up where the fireworks were\n        and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back looking up\n        and there was no-one to see only him and her when she revealed all her\n        graceful beautifully shaped legs like that, supply soft and delicately\n        rounded, and she seemed to hear the panting of his heart, his hoarse\n        breathing, because she knew about the passion of men like that,\n        hotblooded, because Bertha Supple told her once in dead secret and made\n        her swear she'd never about the gentleman lodger that was staying with\n        them out of the Congested <span data-edition=\"ed1961\" data-page=\"365\"> </span>Districts Board that had pictures cut out of\n        <span data-edition=\"ed1932\" data-page=\"330\"> </span>papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said he used to do\n        something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes in the <span data-edition=\"ed1986\" data-page=\"299\"> </span>bed. But\n        this was altogether different from a thing like that because there was\n        all the difference because she could almost feel him draw her face to\n        his and the first quick hot touch of his handsome lips. Besides there\n        was absolution so long as you didn't do the other thing before being\n        married and there ought to be women priests that would understand\n        without your telling out and Cissy Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy\n        kind of dreamy look in her eyes so that she too, my dear, and Winny\n        Rippingham so mad about actors' photographs and besides it was on\n        account of that other thing coming on the way it did.\n      </p>\n      <span data-edition=\"ed1939\" data-page=\"264\"> </span>\n      <p>\n        And Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned back\n        and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and\n        they all saw it and shouted to look, look, there it was and\n        she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was\n        flying about through the air, a soft thing, to and fro, dark. And she saw a\n        long Roman candle going up over \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1922\" data-page=\"349\"> </span>\n        the trees, up, up, and, in the tense\n        hush, they were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and\n        higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up after it, high,\n        high, almost out of sight, and her face was suffused with a divine, an\n        entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her other things\n        too, nainsook knickers, the fabric that caresses the skin, better than\n        those other pettiwidth, the green, four and eleven, on account of being\n        white and she let him and she saw that he saw and then it went so high\n        it went out of sight a moment and she was trembling in every limb from\n        being bent so far back that he had a full view high up above her knee\n        where no-one ever not even on the swing or wading and she wasn't ashamed\n        and he wasn't either to look in that immodest way like that because he\n        couldn't resist the sight of the wondrous revealment half offered like\n        those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemen looking and he\n        kept on looking, looking. She would fain have cried to him chokingly,\n        held out her snowy slender arms to him to come, to feel his lips laid on\n        her white brow, the cry of a young girl's love, a little strangled cry,\n        wrung from her, that cry that has rung through the ages. And then a\n        rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and O! then the Roman candle\n        burst and it was like a <span data-edition=\"ed1961\" data-page=\"366\"> </span>sigh of O! and everyone cried O! O! in raptures\n        and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and they\n        shed and ah! they were <Annotation annotationId=\"180010dewy\">all greeny dewy stars falling with golden</Annotation>, O so\n        lovely!

No. She had to go but they would meet\n        again, there, and she would dream of that till then, tomorrow, of her\n        dream of yester eve. She drew herself up to her full height. Their souls\n        met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart, full\n        of a strange shining, hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face.

Bad plan however if you don't know how to end\n        the conversation. Ask them a question they ask you another. Good idea if\n        you're stuck. Gain time. But then you're in a cart.

For, sirs, he said, our lust is brief. We are means\n        to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends than we.\n        Then said Dixon junior to Punch Costello wist he what ends. But he had\n        overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he\n        would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman if\n        it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead. Whereat\n        Crotthers of Alba Longa sang young Malachi's praise of that beast the\n        unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn, the other all\n        this while, pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice\n        him, witnessing all and several by saint Foutinus his engines that\n        he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to do. Thereat\n        laughed they all right jocundly only young Stephen and sir Leopold which\n        never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he would\n        not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might\n        be or wheresoever. Then spoke young Stephen orgulous of mother Church\n        that <span data-edition=\"ed1961\" data-page=\"389\"> </span>would cast him out of her bosom, of law of canons, of Lilith,\n        patron of abortions, <span data-edition=\"ed1932\" data-page=\"352\"> </span>of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness\n        or by <Annotation annotationId=\"030149vampire\">potency of vampires</Annotation> <Annotation annotationId=\"090003hyde\">mouth to mouth</Annotation> or, as Virgilius saith, by the\n        influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or an she lie\n        with a woman which her man has but lain with, <i>effectu secuto</i>, or\n        peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of Averroes and Moses\n        Maimonides. He said also how at the end of the second month a human soul\n        was infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for God's\n        greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to bring forth\n        beastly should die by canon for so saith \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1939\" data-page=\"281\"> </span>\n        he that holdeth the fisherman's\n        seal, even that blessed Peter on which rock was holy church for all ages\n        founded. All they bachelors then asked of sir Leopold would he in like\n        case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life. A wariness of\n        mind he would answer as fitted all and, laying hand to jaw, he said\n        dissembling, as his wont was, that as it was informed him, who had ever\n        loved the art of physic as might a layman, and agreeing also with his\n        experience of so seldom seen an accident it was good for that mother\n        Church belike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort\n        deliverly he scaped their questions.

Master\n        Lenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds\n        and how, as he heard hereof counted, he had besmirched the lily virtue\n        of a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all\n        intershowed it too, waxing merry \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1922\" data-page=\"374\"> </span>\n        and toasting to his fathership.

One time he would be a playactor,\n        then a sutler or a welsher, then nought would keep him from the bearpit\n        and the cocking main, then he was for the ocean sea or to foot it on\n        the roads with <Annotation annotationId=\"030078tinkers\">the Romany folk</Annotation>, kidnapping a squire's heir by favour of\n        moonlight or fecking maids' linen or choking chickens behind a hedge.

I protest I saw them but this day morning going to the Liverpool\n        boats, says he. I can scarce believe 'tis so bad, says he. And he had\n        experience of the like brood beasts and of springers, greasy hoggets and\n        wether wools having been some years before actuary for Mr Joseph Cuffe,\n        a worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live stock and meadow\n        auctions hard by Mr Gavin Low's yard in Prussia street.

Come, come, says Mr Vincent, plain dealing.\n        He'll find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a\n        bull that's Irish, says he. Irish by name and irish by nature, says Mr\n        Stephen, and he sent the ale purling about, an Irish bull in an English\n        chinashop. I conceive you, says Mr Dixon. It is that same bull that was\n        <Annotation annotationId=\"010142greenstone\">sent to our island by farmer Nicholas, the bravest cattlebreeder of them\n        all, with an emerald ring in his nose</Annotation>. True for you, says Mr Vincent\n        cross the table, and a bullseye into the bargain, says he, and a plumper\n        and a portlier bull, says he, never shit on shamrock. He had horns\n        galore, a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of\n        his nostrils so that the women of our island, leaving doughballs and\n        rollingpins, followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains.\n        <span data-edition=\"ed1932\" data-page=\"361\"> </span>What for that, says Mr Dixon, but before he came over farmer Nicholas\n        that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who\n        <span data-edition=\"ed1961\" data-page=\"399\"> </span>were no better off than himself. So be off now, says he, and do all my\n        cousin german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmer's blessing, and\n        with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly. But the slap and the\n        blessing stood him friend, says Mr Vincent, for to make up he taught him\n        a trick worth two of the other so that maid, wife, abbess and widow to\n        this day affirm that they would rather any time of the month <Annotation annotationId=\"010020ancientgreek\">whisper\n        in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse</Annotation> or get a lick on the nape from his\n        long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in\n        the four fields of all Ireland. Another then put in his word: And they\n        dressed him, says he, in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and\n        girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him\n        all over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of\n        the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market\n        so that he could doss and dung to his heart's content. By this time the\n        father of the faithful (for so they called him) was grown so heavy that\n        he could scarce walk to pasture. To remedy which our cozening dames and\n        damsels brought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon as his\n        belly was full he would rear up on his hind quarters to show their\n        ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bulls' language\n        and they all after him. Ay, says another, and so pampered was he that he\n        would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself\n        (for that was the only colour to his mind) and there was a board put up\n        on a hillock in the middle of the \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1922\" data-page=\"381\"> </span>\n        island with a printed notice, saying:\n        By the Lord Harry, Green is the grass that grows on the ground. And,\n        says Mr Dixon, if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in Roscommon or\n        <Annotation annotationId=\"170019localities\">the wilds of Connemara</Annotation> or a husbandman in Sligo that was sowing as much\n        as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out he run amok over half\n        the countryside rooting \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1939\" data-page=\"288\"> </span>\n        up with his horns whatever was planted and all\n        by lord Harry's orders. There was bad blood between them at first, says\n        Mr <span data-edition=\"ed1986\" data-page=\"327\"> </span>Vincent, and the lord Harry called farmer Nicholas all the old Nicks\n        in the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house\n        and I'll meddle in his matters, says he. I'll make that animal smell\n        hell, says he, with the help of that good pizzle my father left me. But\n        one evening, says Mr Dixon, when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal\n        pelt to go to dinner after winning a boatrace (he had spade oars for\n        himself but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row\n        with <span data-edition=\"ed1961\" data-page=\"400\"> </span>pitchforks) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull\n        and on picking up a blackthumbed <span data-edition=\"ed1932\" data-page=\"362\"> </span>chapbook that he kept in the pantry\n        he found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous\n        champion bull of the Romans, <i>Bos Bovum</i>, which is good bog Latin for\n        boss of the show. After that, says Mr Vincent, the lord Harry put his\n        head into a cow's drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers\n        and pulling it out again told them all his new name. Then, with the\n        water running off him, he got into an old smock and skirt that had\n        belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls' language\n        to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first personal\n        pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went\n        out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it up on what\n        took his fancy, the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of\n        cotton or a corkfloat. In short, he and the bull of Ireland were soon as\n        fast friends as an arse and a shirt. They were, says Mr Stephen, and\n        the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward, as\n        the ungrate women were all of one mind, made a wherry raft, loaded\n        themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard, set all masts\n        erect, manned the yards, sprang their luff, heaved to, spread three\n        sheets in the wind, put her head between wind and water, weighed anchor,\n        ported her helm, ran up the jolly Roger, gave three times three, let the\n        bullgine run, pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea to recover\n        the main of America. Which was the occasion, says Mr Vincent, of the\n        composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty:\n      </p>\n      <p><i>—{\" \"}Pope Peter's but a pissabed.\n        </i>\n      </p>\n      <i>\n      </i>\n      <p><i>\n        A man's a man for a' that.</i>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Our worthy acquaintance, Mr Malachi Mulligan, now appeared in the \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1922\" data-page=\"382\"> </span>\n        doorway as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend\n        whom he had just rencountered, a young gentleman, his name Alec Bannon,\n        who had late come to town, it being his intention to buy a colour or a\n        cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars. Mr Mulligan was civil\n        enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a\n        project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched\n        on. Whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards\n        which he had had printed that day at Mr Quinnell's bearing a legend\n        printed <span data-edition=\"ed1961\" data-page=\"401\"> </span>in fair italics: <i>Mr Malachi Mulligan. Fertiliser and Incubator.\n        Lambay Island</i>. His project, as he went on to expound, was to withdraw\n        from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business of sir\n        Fopling Popinjay and sir Milksop Quidnunc in town and to devote himself\n        to the noblest task for <span data-edition=\"ed1986\" data-page=\"328\"> </span>which our bodily organism has been framed. Well,\n        let us hear of it, good my friend, said Mr Dixon. I make no doubt it\n        smacks of wenching. Come, be seated, both. 'Tis as <span data-edition=\"ed1932\" data-page=\"363\"> </span>cheap sitting as\n        standing. Mr Mulligan accepted of the invitation and, expatiating on\n        his design, told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by\n        a consideration of the \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1939\" data-page=\"289\"> </span>\n        causes of sterility, both the inhibitory and the\n        prohibitory, whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal\n        vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the\n        prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities\n        acquired. It grieved him plaguily, he said, to see the nuptial couch\n        defrauded of its dearest pledges: and to reflect upon so many agreeable\n        females with rich jointures, a prey for the vilest bonzes, who hide their\n        flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly\n        bloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might\n        <Annotation annotationId=\"080028multiply\">multiply the inlets of happiness</Annotation>, sacrificing the inestimable jewel of\n        their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress, this, he\n        assured them, made his heart weep. To curb this inconvenient (which\n        he concluded due to a suppression of latent heat), having advised with\n        certain counsellors of worth and inspected into this matter, he had\n        resolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of Lambay\n        island from its holder, <Annotation annotationId=\"030150malahide\">lord Talbot de Malahide, a Tory gentleman of\n        note much in favour with our ascendancy party</Annotation>. He proposed to set up\n        there a national fertilising farm to be named <Annotation annotationId=\"010065omphalos\"><i>Omphalos</i></Annotation> with an obelisk\n        hewn and erected after the fashion of Egypt and to offer his dutiful\n        yeoman services for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life\n        soever who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the\n        functions of her natural. Money was no object, he said, nor would he\n        take a penny for his pains. The poorest kitchenwench no less than the\n        opulent lady of fashion, if so be their constructions and their tempers \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1922\" data-page=\"383\"> </span>\n        were warm persuaders for their petitions, would find in him their man.\n        For his nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a\n        diet of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there, the flesh of these\n        latter prolific <span data-edition=\"ed1961\" data-page=\"402\"> </span>rodents being highly recommended for his purpose, both\n        broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum\n        chillies. After this homily which he delivered with much warmth of\n        asseveration Mr Mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with\n        which he had shielded it. They both, it seems, had been overtaken by the\n        rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water, as might be\n        observed by Mr Mulligan's smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now\n        somewhat piebald. His project meanwhile was very favourably entertained\n        by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though Mr Dixon of\n        Mary's excepted to it, asking with a finicking air did he purpose also\n        to carry coals to Newcastle. Mr Mulligan however <span data-edition=\"ed1932\" data-page=\"364\"> </span>made court to the\n        scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which, as it dwelt\n        upon his memory, seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of his\n        contention: <i>Talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi, O quirites,\n        ut matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici\n        titillationes</i> <span data-edition=\"ed1986\" data-page=\"329\"> </span><i>testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus\n        centurionum Romanorum magnopere anteponunt</i> while for those of ruder\n        wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more\n        suitable to their stomach, the buck and doe of the forest glade, the\n        farmyard drake and duck.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Valuing himself not a little upon his elegance, being indeed a proper\n        man of his person, this talkative now applied himself to his dress with\n        animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics\n        while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had\n        advanced. The young gentleman, his friend, overjoyed as he was at a\n        passage that had befallen him, could not forbear to tell it his\n        nearest neighbour. Mr Mulligan, now perceiving the table, asked for whom\n        were those loaves and fishes and, seeing the stranger, he made him\n        a civil \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1939\" data-page=\"290\"> </span>\n        bow and said, Pray, sir, was you in need of any professional\n        assistance we could give? Who, upon his offer, thanked him very\n        heartily, though preserving his proper distance, and replied that he was\n        come there about a lady, now an inmate of Horne's house, that was in an\n        interesting condition, poor lady, from woman's woe (and here he fetched\n        a deep sigh) to know if her happiness had yet taken place. Mr Dixon,\n        to turn the table, took on to ask of Mr Mulligan himself whether\n        his incipient ventripotence, upon which he rallied him, betokened an\n        ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due,\n        as with the noted physician, <span data-edition=\"ed1961\" data-page=\"403\"> </span>Mr Austin Meldon, to a wolf in the stomach.\n        For answer Mr Mulligan, in a gale of laughter at his \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1922\" data-page=\"384\"> </span>\n        smalls, smote\n        himself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable droll\n        mimic of <Annotation annotationId=\"010134mothergrogan\">Mother Grogan</Annotation> (the most excellent creature of her sex though\n        'tis pity she's a trollop): There's a belly that never bore a bastard.\n        This was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storms of mirth and threw\n        the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight. The spry\n        rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some larum in the\n        antechamber.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Here the listener who was none other than the Scotch student, a little\n        fume of a fellow, blond as tow, congratulated in the liveliest fashion\n        with the young gentleman and, interrupting the narrative at a salient\n        point, having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the\n        obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by\n        a questioning poise of the head (a whole century of polite breeding had\n        <span data-edition=\"ed1932\" data-page=\"365\"> </span>not achieved so nice a gesture) to which was united an equivalent but\n        contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever\n        done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it. <i>Mais bien sûr</i>,\n        noble stranger, said he cheerily, <i>et mille compliments</i>. That you may\n        and very opportunely. There wanted nothing but this cup to crown my\n        felicity. But, gracious heaven, was I left with but a crust in my wallet\n        and a cupful of water from the well, my God, I would accept of them and\n        find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give thanks to\n        the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the Giver of good\n        things. With these words he approached the goblet to his lips, took a\n        complacent draught of the cordial, slicked his hair and, opening his\n        <span data-edition=\"ed1986\" data-page=\"330\"> </span>bosom, out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband, that very\n        picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein.\n        Gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness, Ah, Monsieur, he\n        said, had you but beheld her as I did with these eyes at that affecting\n        instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap (a gift for her\n        feastday as she told me) in such an artless disorder, of so\n        melting a tenderness, 'pon my conscience, even you, Monsieur, had been\n        impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of\n        such an enemy or to quit the field for ever. I declare, I was never so\n        touched in all my life. God, I thank thee, as the Author of my days!\n        Thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a <span data-edition=\"ed1961\" data-page=\"404\"> </span>creature will bless with her\n        favours. A sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and, having\n        replaced the locket in his bosom, he wiped his eye and sighed again.\n        Beneficent Disseminator of blessings to all Thy creatures, how great\n        and universal must be that sweetest of Thy tyrannies which can hold in\n        thrall the free and the bond, the simple swain and the polished coxcomb,\n        the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of maturer\n        years. But \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1922\" data-page=\"385\"> </span>\n        indeed, sir, I wander from the point. How mingled and\n        imperfect are all our sublunary joys. Maledicity! Would to God that foresight had remembered me to take my\n        cloak along! I could weep to think of \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1939\" data-page=\"291\"> </span>\n        it. Then, though it had poured\n        seven showers, we were neither of us a penny the worse. But beshrew me,\n        he cried, clapping hand to his forehead, tomorrow will be a new day and,\n        thousand thunders, I know of a <i>marchand de capotes</i>, Monsieur Poyntz,\n        from whom I can have for a livre as snug a cloak of the French fashion\n        as ever kept a lady from wetting. Tut, tut! cries Le Fecondateur,\n        tripping in, my friend Monsieur Moore, that most accomplished traveller\n        (I have just cracked a half bottle <i>avec lui</i> in a circle of the best wits\n        of the town), is my authority that in Cape Horn, <i>ventre biche</i>, they\n        have a rain that will wet through <span data-edition=\"ed1932\" data-page=\"366\"> </span>any, even the stoutest cloak. A\n        drenching of that violence, he tells me, <i>sans blague</i>, has sent more\n        than one luckless fellow in good earnest posthaste to another world.\n        Pooh! A <i>livre!</i> cries Monsieur Lynch. The clumsy things are dear at a\n        sou. One umbrella, were it no bigger than a fairy mushroom, is worth ten\n        such stopgaps. No woman of any wit would wear one. My dear Kitty told me\n        today that she would dance in a deluge before ever she would starve in\n        such an ark of salvation for, as she reminded me (blushing piquantly and\n        whispering in my ear though there was none to snap her words but giddy\n        butterflies), dame Nature, by the divine blessing, has implanted it in\n        our hearts and it has become a household word that <i>il y a deux choses</i>\n        for which the innocence of our original garb, in other circumstances a\n        breach of the proprieties, is the fittest, nay, the only garment. The\n        first, said she (and here my pretty philosopher, as I handed her to her\n        tilbury, to fix my attention, gently tipped with her tongue the outer\n        chamber of my ear), the first is a bath... But at this point a bell\n        tinkling in the hall cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for\n        the enrichment of our store of knowledge.\n      </p>\n      <span data-edition=\"ed1986\" data-page=\"331\"> </span><span data-edition=\"ed1961\" data-page=\"405\"> </span>\n      <p>\n        Amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and, while\n        all were conjecturing what might be the cause, Miss Callan entered and,\n        having spoken a few words in a low tone to young Mr Dixon, retired with\n        a profound bow to the company. The presence even for a moment among a\n        party of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and\n        not less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of\n        the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of\n        ribaldry. Strike me silly, said Costello, a low fellow who was fuddled.\n        A monstrous fine bit of cowflesh! I'll be sworn she has rendezvoused\n        you. What, you dog? Have you a way with them? Gad's bud, immensely\n        so, said Mr Lynch. The bedside manner it \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1922\" data-page=\"386\"> </span>\n        is that they use in <Annotation annotationId=\"010068themater\">the Mater\n        hospice</Annotation>. Demme, does not Doctor O'Gargle chuck the nuns there under the\n        chin. As I look to be saved I had it from my Kitty who has been wardmaid\n        there any time these seven months. Lawksamercy, doctor, cried the young\n        blood in the <Annotation annotationId=\"010103waistcoat\">primrose vest</Annotation>, feigning a womanish simper and immodest\n        squirmings of his body, how you do tease a body! Drat the man! Bless\n        me, I'm all of a wibbly wobbly. Why, you're as bad as dear little Father\n        Cantekissem, that you are! May this pot of four half choke me, cried\n        Costello, if she aint in the family way. I knows a lady what's got a\n        white swelling quick as I claps eyes on her. The young surgeon, however,\n        rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as the nurse had just\n        then informed him that he was needed in the ward. Merciful providence\n        had been pleased to put a <span data-edition=\"ed1932\" data-page=\"367\"> </span>period to the sufferings of the lady who was\n        <i>enceinte</i> which she had borne with a laudable fortitude and she had\n        given birth to a bouncing boy. I want patience, said he, with those\n        who, without wit to enliven or learning to instruct, revile an ennobling\n        profession which, saving the reverence due to the Deity, is the greatest\n        power \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1939\" data-page=\"292\"> </span>\n        for happiness upon the earth. I am positive when I say that if\n        need were I could produce a cloud of witnesses to the excellence of\n        her noble exercitations which, so far from being a byword, should be a\n        glorious incentive in the human breast. I cannot away with them. What?\n        Malign such an one, the amiable Miss Callan, who is the lustre of\n        her own sex and the astonishment of ours? And at an instant the most\n        momentous that can befall a puny child of clay? Perish the thought! I\n        shudder to think of the future of a race where the seeds of such malice\n        have been sown and where no right reverence is <span data-edition=\"ed1961\" data-page=\"406\"> </span>rendered to mother and\n        maid in house of Horne. Having delivered himself of this rebuke he\n        saluted those present on the by and repaired to the door. A murmur\n        of approval arose from all and some were for ejecting the low soaker\n        without more ado, a design which would have been effected nor would\n        he have received more than his bare deserts had he not abridged his\n        transgression by affirming with a horrid imprecation (for he swore a\n        round hand) that he was as good a son of the true fold as ever drew\n        breath. Stap my vitals, said he, them was always the sentiments of\n        honest Frank Costello which I was bred up most particular to honour thy\n        father and thy mother <span data-edition=\"ed1986\" data-page=\"332\"> </span>that had the best hand to a rolypoly or a hasty\n        pudding as you ever see what I always looks back on with a loving heart.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        To revert to Mr Bloom who, after his first entry, had been conscious of\n        some impudent mocks which he however had borne with being the fruits\n        of that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not\n        pity. The young \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1922\" data-page=\"387\"> </span>\n        sparks, it is true, were as full of extravagancies\n        as overgrown children: the words of their tumultuary discussions\n        were difficultly understood and not often nice: their testiness and\n        outrageous <i>mots</i> were such that his intellects resiled from: nor were\n        they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of\n        strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf. But the word of Mr Costello\n        was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch that\n        seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity, born out\n        of wedlock and thrust like a crookback teethed and feet first into the\n        world, which the dint of the surgeon's pliers in his skull lent indeed\n        a colour to, so as it put him in thought of that missing link of\n        creation's chain desiderated by the late ingenious Mr Darwin. It was now\n        for more than the middle <span data-edition=\"ed1932\" data-page=\"368\"> </span>span of our allotted years that he had passed\n        through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and, being of a wary\n        ascendancy and self a man of a rare forecast, he had enjoined his heart\n        to repress all motions of a rising choler and, by intercepting them\n        with the readiest precaution, foster within his breast that plenitude\n        of sufferance which base minds jeer at, rash judgers scorn and all find\n        tolerable and but tolerable. To those who create themselves wits at the\n        cost of feminine delicacy (a habit of mind which he never did hold\n        with) to them he would concede neither to bear the name nor to herit\n        the tradition of a proper breeding: while for such that, <span data-edition=\"ed1961\" data-page=\"407\"> </span>having lost\n        all forbearance, can lose no more, there remained the sharp antidote of\n        experience to cause their insolency to beat a precipitate and inglorious\n        retreat. Not but what he could feel with mettlesome youth which, caring\n        nought for the mows of dotards or the gruntlings of the severe, is ever\n        (as the chaste fancy of the Holy Writer expresses it) for eating of the\n        tree forbid it yet not so far forth as to pretermit humanity upon any\n        condition soever towards a gentlewoman when she was about her lawful\n        occasions. To conclude, while from the sister's words he had reckoned\n        upon a speedy delivery he was, however, it must \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1939\" data-page=\"293\"> </span>\n        be owned, not a little\n        alleviated by the intelligence that the issue so auspicated after an\n        ordeal of such duress now testified once more to the mercy as well as to\n        the bounty of the Supreme Being.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour, saying that, to express\n        his notion of the thing, his opinion (who ought not perchance to express\n        one) was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid genius not\n        to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her confinement\n        since she had been in such pain through no fault of hers. The dressy\n        young blade said it was her husband's that put her in that expectation\n        or at least it ought to be unless she were another Ephesian matron. I\n        must acquaint you, <span data-edition=\"ed1986\" data-page=\"333\"> </span>said Mr Crotthers, \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1922\" data-page=\"388\"> </span>\n        clapping on the table so as to\n        evoke a resonant comment of emphasis, old Glory Allelujurum was round\n        again today, an elderly man with dundrearies, preferring through his\n        nose a request to have word of Wilhelmina, my life, as he calls her. I\n        bade him hold himself in readiness for that the event would burst anon.\n        'Slife, I'll be round with you. I cannot but extol the virile potency of\n        the old bucko that could still knock another child out of her. All fell\n        to praising of it, each after his own fashion, though the same young\n        blade held with his former view that another than her conjugial had\n        been the man in the gap, a clerk in orders, a linkboy (virtuous) or\n        an itinerant vendor of articles needed in every household. Singular,\n        communed the guest with himself, the wonderfully unequal faculty of\n        <span data-edition=\"ed1932\" data-page=\"369\"> </span><Annotation annotationId=\"030087pastlife\">metempsychosis</Annotation> possessed by them, that the puerperal dormitory and the\n        dissecting theatre should be the seminaries of such frivolity, that the\n        mere acquisition of academic titles should suffice to transform in a\n        pinch of time these votaries of levity into exemplary practitioners of\n        an art which most men anywise eminent have esteemed the noblest. But,\n        he further added, it <span data-edition=\"ed1961\" data-page=\"408\"> </span>is mayhap to relieve the pentup feelings that in\n        common oppress them for I have more than once observed that birds of a\n        feather laugh together.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        But with what fitness, let it be asked of the noble lord, his patron,\n        has this alien, whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted\n        to civic rights, constituted himself the lord paramount of our\n        internal polity? Where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have\n        counselled? During the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary\n        advantage with his granados did this traitor to his kind not seize that\n        moment to discharge his piece against the empire of which he is a tenant\n        at will while he trembled for the security of his four per cents? Has he\n        forgotten this as he forgets all benefits received? Or is it that from\n        being a deluder of others he has become at last his own dupe as he is,\n        if report belie him not, his own and his only enjoyer? Far be it from\n        candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady, the daughter of\n        <Annotation annotationId=\"030118royaldublins\">a gallant major</Annotation>, or to cast the most distant reflections upon her\n        virtue but if he challenges attention there (as it was indeed highly his\n        interest not to have done) then be it so. Unhappy woman, she has been\n        too long and too persistently denied her legitimate prerogative to\n        listen to his objurgations with any other feeling than the derision of\n        the desperate. He says this, a censor of morals, a very pelican in his\n        piety, who did not scruple, oblivious of the ties of nature, to attempt\n        illicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn from the lowest strata\n        of society! Nay, had the hussy's scouringbrush not been her tutelary\n        angel it had gone with her as hard as with \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1922\" data-page=\"389\"> </span>\n        Hagar, the Egyptian!

When he had betaken himself\n        to the women's apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the\n        afterbirth in the presence of the secretary of state for domestic\n        affairs and the members of the privy council, silent in unanimous\n        exhaustion and approbation the delegates, chafing under the length and\n        solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would\n        palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and\n        officer rendered the easier, broke out at once into a strife of\n        tongues. In vain the voice of Mr Canvasser Bloom was heard endeavouring\n        to urge, to mollify, to restrain. The moment was too propitious for the\n        display of that discursiveness which seemed the only band of union among\n        tempers so divergent. Every phase of the situation was successively\n        eviscerated: the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers, the Caesarean\n        section, posthumity with respect to the father and, that rarer form,\n        with respect to the mother, the fratricidal case known as the Childs\n        Murder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of Mr Advocate\n        Bushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused, the\n        rights of primogeniture and king's bounty touching twins and triplets,\n        miscarriages and infanticides, simulated and dissimulated, acardiac\n        <i>foetus in foetu,</i> aprosopia due to a congestion, the agnathia\n        of certain chinless Chinamen (cited by Mr Candidate Mulligan) in\n        consequence of \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1922\" data-page=\"390\"> </span>\n        defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the medial\n        line so that (as he said) one ear could hear what the other spoke, the\n        benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep, the prolongation of labour\n        pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the vein, the\n        premature relentment of the amniotic fluid (as exemplified in the\n        actual case) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix, artificial\n        insemination by means of syringes, involution of the womb consequent\n        upon the menopause, the problem of the perpetuation of the species <span data-edition=\"ed1961\" data-page=\"410\"> </span>in\n        the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape, that distressing\n        manner of delivery called by the Brandenburghers <i>Sturzgeburt,</i> the\n        recorded instances of multigeminal, twikindled and monstruous births\n        conceived <span data-edition=\"ed1932\" data-page=\"371\"> </span>during the catamenic period or of consanguineous parents—{\" \"}in\n        a word all the cases of human nativity which Aristotle has classified\n        in his masterpiece with <span data-edition=\"ed1986\" data-page=\"335\"> </span>chromolithographic illustrations.

The young man's face grew dark. All could see how hard\n        it was for him to be reminded of his promise and of his recent loss. He\n        would have withdrawn from the feast had not the noise of voices allayed\n        the smart. Madden had lost five drachmas on Sceptre for a whim of the\n        rider's name: Lenehan as much more. He told them of the race.

But in the straight on the run home when all were in close\n        order the dark horse Throwaway drew level, reached, outstripped her. All\n        was lost now. Phyllis was silent: her eyes were sad anemones. Juno, she\n        cried, I am undone. But her lover consoled her and brought her a bright\n        casket of gold in which lay some oval sugarplums which she partook. A\n        tear fell: one only. A whacking fine whip, \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1939\" data-page=\"298\"> </span>\n        said Lenehan, is W. Lane.\n        Four winners yesterday and three today. What rider is like him? Mount\n        him on the camel or the boisterous buffalo the victory in a hack canter\n        is still his. But let us bear it as was the ancient wont. Mercy on the\n        luckless! Poor Sceptre! he said with a light sigh. She is not the filly\n        that she was. Never, by this hand, shall we behold such another. By gad,\n        sir, a queen of them. Do you remember her, Vincent? I wish you could\n        have seen my queen today, Vincent said. How young she was and radiant\n        (Lalage were scarce fair beside her) in her yellow shoes and frock of\n        muslin, I do not know the right name of it. The chestnuts that shaded\n        us were in bloom: <span data-edition=\"ed1961\" data-page=\"415\"> </span>the air drooped with their persuasive odour and with\n        pollen floating by us. In the sunny patches one might easily have\n        cooked on a stone a batch of those buns with Corinth fruit in them that\n        Periplipomenes sells in his booth near the bridge. But she had nought\n        for her teeth but the arm with which I held her and in that she nibbled\n        mischievously when I pressed too close. A week ago she lay ill, four\n        days on the couch, but today she was free, blithe, mocked at peril.\n        She is more taking then. Her posies too! Mad romp that she is, she had\n        pulled her fill as we reclined together. And in your ear, my friend, you\n        will not think who met us as we left the field. Conmee himself! He was\n        walking by the hedge, reading, I think a brevier book with, I doubt not,\n        a witty letter in it from Glycera or Chloe to keep the page. The sweet\n        <span data-edition=\"ed1986\" data-page=\"339\"> </span>creature turned all colours in her confusion, feigning to reprove a\n        slight disorder in her dress: a slip of \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1922\" data-page=\"395\"> </span>\n        underwood clung there for the\n        very trees adore her. When Conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely\n        echo in the little mirror she carries. But he had been kind. In going\n        by he had blessed us. The gods too are ever kind, Lenehan said. If I had\n        poor luck with Bass's mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more\n        propensely. He was laying his hand upon a winejar: Malachi saw it and\n        withheld his act, pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label.\n        Warily, Malachi whispered, preserve a <Annotation annotationId=\"010018druids\">druid</Annotation> silence. His soul is far\n        away. It is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be\n        born.

Theosophos\n        told me so, Stephen answered, whom in a previous existence Egyptian\n        priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law. The lords of the\n        moon, Theosophos told me, an orangefiery shipload from planet Alpha\n        of the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these\n        were therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second\n        constellation.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        However, as a matter of fact though, the preposterous surmise about him\n        being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which\n        was entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character, was\n        not the case at all. The individual whose visual organs while the above\n        was going on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of\n        animation was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody\n        that conjectured the contrary would have found <span data-edition=\"ed1961\" data-page=\"416\"> </span>themselves pretty\n        speedily in the wrong shop. During the past four minutes or thereabouts\n        he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one Bass bottled\n        by Messrs Bass and Co at Burton-on-Trent which happened to be situated\n        amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was\n        certainly calculated to attract anyone's remark on account of its\n        scarlet appearance. He was simply and solely, as it subsequently\n        transpired for reasons best known to himself, which put quite an\n        altogether different complexion on the proceedings, after the moment\n        before's observations about boyhood days and the turf, <Annotation annotationId=\"160008littlepills\">recollecting two</Annotation>\n        <span data-edition=\"ed1939\" data-page=\"299\"> </span>\n        <Annotation annotationId=\"160008littlepills\">or three private transactions of his own</Annotation> which the other two were as\n        mutually innocent of as the babe unborn. Eventually, however, both\n        their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other was\n        endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily determined\n        to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the\n        mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid sought after and\n        made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out with, also at the\n        same time, however, a considerable degree of attentiveness in order not\n        to upset any of the beer that was in it about the place.\n      </p>\n      <span data-edition=\"ed1922\" data-page=\"396\"> </span>\n      <p>\n        The debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the\n        course of life. Neither place nor council was lacking in dignity. The\n        debaters were the keenest in the land, the theme they were engaged on\n        the loftiest and most vital. The high hall of Horne's house had never\n        beheld an <span data-edition=\"ed1986\" data-page=\"340\"> </span>assembly so representative and so varied nor had the\n        old rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so\n        encyclopaedic. A gallant scene in truth it made. Crotthers was there at\n        the foot of the table in his striking Highland garb, his face glowing\n        from the briny airs of the Mull of Galloway. There too, opposite to him,\n        was <span data-edition=\"ed1932\" data-page=\"377\"> </span>Lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early depravity\n        and premature wisdom. Next the Scotchman was the place assigned to\n        Costello, the eccentric, while at his side was seated in stolid repose\n        the squat form of Madden.

Lastly at the head of the board was the young\n        poet who found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical\n        inquisition in the <span data-edition=\"ed1961\" data-page=\"417\"> </span>convivial atmosphere of Socratic discussion, while\n        to right and left of him were accommodated the flippant prognosticator,\n        fresh from the hippodrome, and that vigilant wanderer, soiled by the\n        dust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an indelible\n        dishonour, but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril\n        or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of that voluptuous\n        loveliness which the inspired pencil of Lafayette has limned for ages\n        yet to come.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        It had better be stated here and now at the outset that the <Annotation annotationId=\"010041killergod\">perverted\n        transcendentalism</Annotation> to which Mr S. Dedalus' (Div. Scep.) contentions\n        would appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to\n        accepted scientific methods. Science, it cannot be too often repeated,\n        deals with tangible phenomena. The man of science like the man in the\n        street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain\n        them as best he can. There may be, it is true, some questions which\n        science cannot answer{\" \"}—{\" \"}at present{\" \"}—{\" \"}such \n        as the first problem submitted\n        by Mr L. Bloom (Pubb. Canv.) regarding the future determination of sex.\n        Must we accept the view of Empedocles of Trinacria that the right ovary\n        (the postmenstrual period, assert others) is responsible for the birth\n        of males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the\n        differentiating factors or is it, as most embryologists incline to\n        opine, such as Culpepper, Spallanzani, Blumenbach, Lusk, Hertwig,\n        Leopold and Valenti, a mixture of both. This would be tantamount to\n        a cooperation \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1922\" data-page=\"397\"> </span>\n        (one of nature's favourite devices) between the <i>nisus\n        formativus</i> of the nemasperm on the one hand and on the other a happily\n        chosen position, <i>succubitus felix</i> of the passive element. The other\n        problem raised by the same inquirer is scarcely less vital: infant\n        mortality. It is interesting because, \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1939\" data-page=\"300\"> </span>\n        as he pertinently remarks, we\n        are all born in the same way but we all die in different ways. Mr M.\n        Mulligan (Hyg. et Eug. Doc.) blames the sanitary conditions in which\n        our greylunged citizens contract adenoids, pulmonary complaints etc. by\n        <span data-edition=\"ed1932\" data-page=\"378\"> </span>inhaling the bacteria which lurk in dust. These factors, he alleges,\n        and the revolting spectacles offered by our streets, hideous publicity\n        posters, <span data-edition=\"ed1986\" data-page=\"341\"> </span>religious ministers of all denominations, mutilated soldiers\n        and sailors, exposed scorbutic cardrivers, the suspended carcases of\n        dead animals, paranoic bachelors and unfructified duennas—{\" \"}these, he\n        said, were accountable for any and every fallingoff in the calibre of\n        the race. Kalipedia, he prophesied, would soon be <span data-edition=\"ed1961\" data-page=\"418\"> </span>generally adopted\n        and all the graces of life, genuinely good music, agreeable literature,\n        light philosophy, instructive pictures, <Annotation annotationId=\"080005venus\">plastercast reproductions of\n        the classical statues such as Venus and Apollo</Annotation>, artistic coloured\n        photographs of prize babies, all these little attentions would enable\n        ladies who were in a particular condition to pass the intervening months\n        in a most enjoyable manner. Mr J. Crotthers (Disc. Bacc.) attributes\n        some of these demises to abdominal trauma in the case of women workers\n        subjected to heavy labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in\n        the home but by far the vast majority to neglect, private or official,\n        culminating in the exposure of newborn infants, the practice of criminal\n        abortion or in the atrocious crime of infanticide. Although the former\n        (we are thinking of neglect) is undoubtedly only too true the case he\n        cites of nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity\n        is too rare to be normative. In fact when one comes to look into it the\n        wonder is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they\n        do, all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which\n        often baulk nature in her intentions. An ingenious suggestion is\n        that thrown out by Mr V. Lynch (Bacc. Arith.) that both natality and\n        mortality, as well as all other phenomena of evolution, tidal movements,\n        lunar phases, blood temperatures, diseases in general, everything, in\n        fine, in nature's vast workshop from the extinction of some remote sun\n        to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which beautify our\n        public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet unascertained.\n        Still the plain straightforward question why a child of normally healthy\n        parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly looked after succumbs\n        unaccountably in early childhood (though other children of the \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1922\" data-page=\"398\"> </span>\n        same marriage do not) must certainly, in the poet's words, give us pause.\n        Nature, we may rest assured, has her own good and cogent reasons for\n        whatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law\n        of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous germs have taken\n        up their residence (modern science has conclusively shown that <Annotation annotationId=\"010079akasicrecords\">only the\n        plasmic substance can be said to be immortal</Annotation>) tend to disappear at an\n        increasingly earlier stage of development, an arrangement which, though\n        productive of <span data-edition=\"ed1932\" data-page=\"379\"> </span>pain to some of our feelings (notably the maternal), is\n        nevertheless, some of us think, in the long run beneficial to the\n        race in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest.

In\n        a recent public controversy with Mr L. Bloom (Pubb.

His\n      (Stephen's) mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit\n      unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink Mr\n      Bloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of <Annotation annotationId=\"010010mountains\">Vartry water</Annotation>\n      available for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit upon an\n      expedient by suggesting, off the reel, the propriety of <Annotation annotationId=\"050051shelter\">the cabman's\n      shelter, as it was called, hardly a stonesthrow away near Butt bridge</Annotation>\n      where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and\n      soda or a mineral. But how to get there was the rub. For the nonce he\n      was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him\n      to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means\n      during which Stephen repeatedly yawned. So far as he could see he was\n      rather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly advisable\n      to get a conveyance of some description which would answer in their\n      then condition, both of them being <Annotation annotationId=\"040082highgradeha\">e.d.ed</Annotation>, particularly Stephen, always\n      assuming that there was such a thing to be found. Accordingly after a\n      few such preliminaries as brushing, in spite of his having forgotten\n      to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman\n      service in the shaving line, they both walked together along Beaver\n      street or, more properly, lane as far as the farrier's and the\n      distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of\n      Montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence\n      debouching into Amiens street round by the corner of Dan Bergin's. But\n      as he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a Jehu plying for\n      hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler, probably engaged by some\n      fellows inside on the spree, outside the North Star hotel and there was\n      no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom, who was\n      anything but a professional whistler, endeavoured to hail it by emitting\n      a kind of a whistle, holding his arms arched over his head, twice.\n      <p></p>\n      <span data-edition=\"ed1922\" data-page=\"569\"> </span><span data-edition=\"ed1932\" data-page=\"523\"> </span>\n      <p>\n        This was a quandary but, bringing common sense to bear on it, evidently\n        there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it\n        which they accordingly did. So, bevelling around by Mullett's and the\n        Signal House which they shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in the\n        direction of Amiens street railway terminus, Mr Bloom being handicapped\n        <span data-edition=\"ed1986\" data-page=\"501\"> </span>by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had,\n        <span data-edition=\"ed1961\" data-page=\"613\"> </span>to vary the timehonoured adage, gone the way of all buttons though,\n        entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing, he heroically made\n        light of the mischance. So as neither of them were particularly pressed\n        for time, \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1939\" data-page=\"431\"> </span>\n        as it happened, and the temperature refreshing since it\n        cleared up after the recent visitation of Jupiter Pluvius, they dandered\n        along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a\n        jarvey. As it so happened a <Annotation annotationId=\"070003tramwaycompany\">Dublin United Tramways Company</Annotation>'s sandstrewer\n        happening to be returning the elder man recounted to his companion <i>à \n        propos</i> of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little\n        while back. They passed the main entrance of the Great Northern railway\n        station, the starting point for Belfast, where of course all traffic was\n        suspended at that late hour and passing the backdoor of the morgue\n        (a not very enticing locality, not to say gruesome to a degree, more\n        especially at night) ultimately gained the Dock Tavern and in due course\n        turned into Store street, famous for its C division police station.\n        Between this point and the high at present unlit warehouses of <Annotation annotationId=\"160007shipofthestreet\">Beresford\n        place</Annotation> Stephen thought to think of Ibsen, associated with Baird's the\n        stonecutter's in his mind somehow in Talbot place, first turning on the\n        right, while the other who was acting as his <i>fidus Achates</i> inhaled\n        with internal satisfaction the smell of James Rourke's city bakery,\n        situated quite close to where they were, the very palatable odour indeed\n        of <Annotation annotationId=\"040077ourfather\">our daily bread</Annotation>, of all commodities of the public the primary and\n        most indispensable. Bread, the staff of life, earn your bread, O tell me\n        where is fancy bread, at Rourke's the baker's it is said.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <i>En route,</i> to his taciturn and, not to put too fine a point on it, not\n        yet perfectly sober companion, Mr Bloom, who at all events, was in complete\n        possession of his faculties, never more so, in fact disgustingly sober,\n        spoke a word of caution <i>re</i> the dangers of nighttown, women of ill fame\n        and swell mobsmen, which, barely permissible once in a while, though not\n        as a habitual practice, was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for\n        young fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking\n        habits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu\n        for every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could\n        <span data-edition=\"ed1932\" data-page=\"524\"> </span>administer a nasty kick if you didn't look out. Highly providential\n        was the appearance on the scene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen <span data-edition=\"ed1922\" data-page=\"570\"> </span>was blissfully unconscious that, but for that man in the gap turning up at the\n        eleventh hour the finis might have been that he might have <span data-edition=\"ed1961\" data-page=\"614\"> </span>been a\n        candidate for the accident ward or, failing that, the bridewell and\n        an appearance in the court next day before Mr Tobias or, he being the\n        solicitor rather, old Wall, he meant to say, or Mahony which simply\n        spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about. The reason he mentioned\n        the fact was that a lot of those policemen, whom he cordially disliked,\n        were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the Crown and, as Mr\n        Bloom put it, recalling a case or two in the A division in Clanbrassil\n        street, prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot. Never on\n        the spot <span data-edition=\"ed1986\" data-page=\"502\"> </span>when wanted but in quiet parts of the city, Pembroke road for\n        example, the guardians of the law were well in evidence, the obvious reason being\n        they were paid to protect the upper classes. Another thing he commented\n        on was equipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description\n        liable to go off at any time which was tantamount to inciting them\n        against civilians should by any chance they fall out over anything. You\n        frittered away your time, he very sensibly maintained, and health and\n        also character besides which, the squandermania of the thing, fast women\n        of the <i>demimonde</i> ran away with a lot of £. s. d. into the bargain and\n        the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though, touching\n        the much vexed question of stimulants, he relished a glass of choice old\n        wine in season as both nourishing and \n        bloodmaking and possessing aperient virtues (notably a \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1939\" data-page=\"432\"> </span>\n        good burgundy which he was a staunch believer in) still never beyond\n        a certain point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to\n        trouble all round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of\n        others practically. Most of all he commented adversely on the desertion\n        of Stephen by all his pubhunting <i>confrères</i> but one, a most glaring\n        piece of ratting on the part of his brother medicos under all the circs.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        —{\" \"}And that one was Judas, Stephen said, who up to then had said nothing\n        whatsoever of any kind.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back\n        of the Customhouse and passed under <Annotation annotationId=\"050006looplinebridge\">the Loop Line bridge</Annotation> where a brazier\n        of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one attracted\n        their rather lagging footsteps. Stephen of his own accord stopped for\n        no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by\n        the light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker\n        figure of the <Annotation annotationId=\"060033corporation\">corporation</Annotation> watchman inside the gloom of the <span data-edition=\"ed1932\" data-page=\"525\"> </span>sentrybox. He\n        began to remember that this had <span data-edition=\"ed1961\" data-page=\"615\"> </span>happened, or had been mentioned as having\n        happened, before but it cost \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1922\" data-page=\"571\"> </span>\n        him no small effort before he remembered\n        that he recognised in the sentry a quondam friend of his father's,\n        Gumley. To avoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway\n        bridge.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        —{\" \"}Someone saluted you, Mr Bloom said.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        A figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches\n        saluted again, calling: <i>Night!</i> Stephen of course started \n        rather dizzily and stopped to return the\n        compliment. Mr Bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch\n        as he always believed in minding his own business moved off but\n        nevertheless remained on the <i>qui vive</i> with just a shade of anxiety\n        though not funkyish in the least.

Lord John Corley some called him\n        and his genealogy came about in this wise. He was the eldest son of\n        Inspector Corley of the G division, lately deceased, who had married\n        a certain Katherine Brophy, the daughter of a Louth farmer. His\n        grandfather Patrick Michael Corley of New Ross had married the widow\n        of a publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine (also) Talbot.\n        Rumour had it (though not proved) that <Annotation annotationId=\"030150malahide\">she descended from the house of\n        the lords Talbot de Malahide in whose mansion, really an unquestionably\n        fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing, her mother or aunt or\n        some relative, a woman, as the tale went, of extreme beauty, had enjoyed\n        the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen</Annotation>. This therefore\n        was the reason why the still comparatively young though dissolute\n        man who now addressed Stephen was spoken of by some with facetious\n        proclivities as Lord John Corley.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Taking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell.\n        <Annotation annotationId=\"010019money\">Not as much as a farthing</Annotation> to purchase a night's <span data-edition=\"ed1961\" data-page=\"616\"> </span>lodgings.

On more than one occasion—a dozen\n        at the lowest—near the North Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a\n        superannuated old salt, evidently derelict, seated habitually near the\n        not particularly redolent sea on the wall, staring quite obliviously at\n        it and it at him, dreaming of <Annotation annotationId=\"020010lycidas\">fresh woods and pastures new as someone\n        somewhere sings</Annotation>.

It was quite on a par with\n        the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years\n        the coal seam of the sister island would be played out and if, as\n        time went on, that turned out to be how the cat jumped all he could\n        personally say on the matter was that as a host of contingencies,\n        equally relevant to the issue, might occur ere then it was highly\n        advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countries, even\n        though poles apart.

The rebuke of some\n        kind was clearer than the other part. Needless to say, the fumes of\n        his recent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way,\n        foreign to his sober state. Probably the home life, to which Mr Bloom attached\n        the utmost importance, had not been all that was needful or he hadn't\n        been familiarised with the right sort of people. With a touch of fear\n        for the young man beside him, whom he furtively scrutinised with an air\n        of some consternation remembering he had just come back <span data-edition=\"ed1932\" data-page=\"553\"> </span>from Paris,\n        the eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister,\n        failing to throw much light on the subject, however, he brought to mind\n        instances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly, nipped in the\n        bud of premature decay, and nobody to blame but themselves. For instance,\n        there was the case of O'Callaghan, for one, the half crazy faddist,\n        respectably connected, though of inadequate means, with his mad vagaries,\n        among whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a nuisance\n        to everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously sporting in\n        public a suit of brown paper (a fact). And then the usual <i>dénouement</i>\n        after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed into hot\n        water and had to be spirited away by a few friends, after a strong hint\n        to a blind <span data-edition=\"ed1961\" data-page=\"645\"> </span>horse from John Mallon of Lower Castle Yard, so as not to\n        be made amenable under section two of the Criminal Law Amendment Act,\n        certain names of those subpoenaed being handed in but not divulged,\n        for reasons which will occur to anyone with a pick of brains.

Highly unlikely, of course, there was even a shadow\n        of truth in the stones and, even supposing, he thought a return highly\n        inadvisable, all things considered. Something evidently riled them in\n        his death. Either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when\n        his various different political arrangements were nearing completion\n        or whether it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to\n        change his boots and clothes after a wetting when a cold resulted and\n        failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his room till he\n        eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a fortnight was at\n        an end or quite possibly they were distressed to find the job was taken\n        out of their hands. Of course nobody being acquainted with his movements\n        even before, there was absolutely no clue as to his whereabouts which\n        were decidedly of the <i>Alice, where art thou</i> order even prior to his\n        starting to go under several aliases such as Fox and Stewart, so the\n        <span data-edition=\"ed1922\" data-page=\"603\"> </span>\n        remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within the bounds of\n        possibility.

Whereas the simple fact of the case was\n        it was simply a case of the husband not being up to the scratch, with\n        nothing in common between them beyond the name, and then a real man\n        arriving on the scene, strong to the verge of weakness, falling a victim\n        to her siren charms and forgetting home ties. The usual sequel, to bask\n        in the loved one's smiles. The eternal question of the life connubial,\n        needless to say, cropped up. Can real love, supposing there happens to\n        be another chap in the case, exist between married folk? Poser.\n        Though it was no concern of theirs absolutely if he regarded her with\n        affection, carried away by a wave of folly. A magnificent specimen of\n        manhood he was truly, augmented obviously by gifts of a high order, as\n        compared with the other military supernumerary, that is (who was just the\n        usual everyday <i>farewell, my gallant captain</i> kind of an individual in\n        the light dragoons, the 18th hussars to be accurate), and inflammable\n        doubtless (the fallen leader, that is, not the other) in his own\n        peculiar way which she of course, woman, quickly perceived as highly\n        likely to carve his way to fame, which he almost bid fair to do till the\n        priests and ministers of the gospel as a whole, his erstwhile staunch\n        adherents and his beloved evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman\n        service in the rural parts of the country by taking up the cudgels on\n        their behalf in a way that exceeded their most sanguine expectations,\n        very effectually cooked his matrimonial goose, thereby heaping \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1922\" data-page=\"605\"> </span>\n        coals of\n        fire on his head, much in the same way as the fabled ass's kick.

As for the face, it was a speaking\n        likeness in expression but it did not do justice to her figure, which\n        came in for a lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the\n        best advantage in that getup. She could without difficulty, he said,\n        have posed for the ensemble, not to dwell on certain opulent curves of\n        the...

Marble could give\n        the original, shoulders, back, all the symmetry. All the rest, yes,\n        Puritanism. It does though, Saint Joseph's sovereign... whereas no photo \n        could, because it simply wasn't art, in a word.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The spirit moving him, he would much have liked to follow Jack Tar's good\n        example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for\n        itself on the plea he... so that the other could drink in the beauty for\n        himself, her stage presence being, frankly, a treat in itself which the\n        camera could not at all do justice to. But it was scarcely professional\n        etiquette so, though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet\n        wonderfully cool for the season considering, for sunshine after storm...\n        And he did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a\n        kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion.\n        Nevertheless, he sat tight, just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased\n        by opulent curves, none the worse for wear, <span data-edition=\"ed1986\" data-page=\"533\"> </span>however, and looked away\n        thoughtfully with the intention of not further increasing the\n        other's possible embarrassment while gauging her symmetry of heaving\n        <i>embonpoint</i>. In fact, the slight soiling was only an added charm, like\n        the case of linen slightly soiled, good as new, much better, in fact,\n        with the starch out. Suppose she was gone when he?... I looked for the lamp\n        which she told me came into his mind but merely as a passing fancy of\n        his because he then recollected the morning littered bed etcetera and\n        <Annotation annotationId=\"040021ruby\">the book about Ruby</Annotation> with <Annotation annotationId=\"030087pastlife\">met him pike hoses</Annotation> (<i>sic</i>) in it which must\n        have fell down sufficiently appropriately beside the domestic chamberpot\n        with apologies to Lindley Murray.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The vicinity of the young man he certainly relished, educated,\n        <i>distingué</i>, and impulsive into the bargain, far and away the pick of the\n        bunch, though you wouldn't think he had it in him... yet you would. Besides\n        he said the \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1922\" data-page=\"607\"> </span>\n        picture was handsome which, say what you like, it was, though\n        at the moment <span data-edition=\"ed1961\" data-page=\"653\"> </span>she was distinctly stouter. And why not? An awful lot of\n        makebelieve went on about that sort of thing involving a lifelong slur\n        with the usual splash page of letterpress about the same \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1939\" data-page=\"459\"> </span>\n        old matrimonial\n        tangle alleging misconduct with professional golfer or the newest\n        stage favourite instead of being honest and aboveboard about the whole\n        business. How they were fated to meet and an attachment sprang up\n        between the two so that their names were coupled in the public eye\n        was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy <span data-edition=\"ed1932\" data-page=\"561\"> </span>and\n        compromising expressions, leaving no loophole, to show that they openly\n        cohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and\n        relations, when the thing ran its normal course, became in due course\n        intimate. Then the decree <i>nisi</i> and the King's proctor tries to show\n        cause why and, he failing to quash it, <i>nisi</i> was made absolute. But as\n        for that, the two misdemeanants, wrapped up as they largely were in one\n        another, could safely afford to ignore it as they very largely did till\n        the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor, who filed a petition for\n        the party wronged in due course. He, Bloom, enjoyed the distinction of being\n        close to Erin's uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred on\n        the historic <i>fracas</i> when the fallen leader's—who notoriously stuck to\n        his guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery—(leader's) trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or\n        possibly even more than that penetrated into the printing works of the\n        <i>Insuppressible</i> or no it was <i>United Ireland</i> (a by no means, by the\n        by, appropriate appellative) and broke up the typecases with hammers or\n        something like that all on account of some scurrilous effusions from\n        the facile pens of the O'Brienite scribes at the usual mudslinging\n        occupation reflecting on the erstwhile tribune's private morals. Though\n        palpably a radically altered man, he was still a commanding figure, though\n        carelessly garbed as usual, with that look of settled purpose which went\n        a long way with the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast\n        discomfiture that their idol had feet of clay, after placing him upon a\n        pedestal, which she, however, was the first to perceive. As those were\n        particularly hot times in the general hullaballoo Bloom sustained a\n        minor <span data-edition=\"ed1986\" data-page=\"534\"> </span>injury from a nasty prod of some chap's elbow in the crowd that\n        of course congregated lodging some place about the pit of the stomach,\n        fortunately not of a grave character. His hat (Parnell's) was\n        inadvertently knocked off and, as a matter of strict history, Bloom was\n        the man who picked it up in the <span data-edition=\"ed1961\" data-page=\"654\"> </span>crush after witnessing the occurrence\n        meaning to return it to him (and return it to him he did with the utmost\n        <span data-edition=\"ed1922\" data-page=\"608\"> </span>\n        celerity) who, panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away\n        from his hat at the time, all the same being a gentleman born with a\n        stake in the country, he, as a matter of fact, having gone into it more\n        for the kudos of the thing than anything else, what's bred in the bone\n        instilled into him in infancy at his mother's knee in the shape of\n        knowing what good form was came out at once because he turned round to\n        the donor and thanked him with perfect <i>aplomb</i>, saying: <i>Thank you,\n        sir</i>, though in a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the\n        legal profession whose headgear Bloom also set to rights earlier in the\n        course of the day, history repeating itself with <span data-edition=\"ed1932\" data-page=\"562\"> </span>a difference, after\n        the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory\n        after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        On the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes\n        of the cabman and so on, who passed it all off as a jest, laughing \n        immoderately, pretending to understand everything, the why and the\n        wherefore, and in reality not knowing their own minds, it being a case\n        for the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate\n        husband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from\n        the usual boy Jones, who happened to come across them \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1939\" data-page=\"460\"> </span>\n        at the crucial\n        moment in a loving position locked in one another's arms, drawing\n        attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic\n        rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord and\n        master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not\n        receive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would overlook\n        the matter and let bygones be bygones, with tears in her eyes, though\n        possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time, as quite\n        possibly there were several others. He personally, being of a sceptical\n        bias, believed, and didn't make the smallest bones about saying so either,\n        that man, or men in the plural, were always hanging around on the waiting\n        list about a lady, even supposing she was the best wife in the world\n        and they got on fairly well together for the sake of argument, when,\n        neglecting her duties, she chose to be tired of wedded life, and was on\n        for a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentions on\n        her with improper intent, the upshot being that her affections centred\n        on another, the cause of many <i>liaisons</i> between still attractive\n        married women getting on for fair and forty <span data-edition=\"ed1961\" data-page=\"655\"> </span>and younger men, no doubt as\n        several famous cases of feminine infatuation proved up to the hilt.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        It was a thousand pities a young fellow blessed with an allowance of\n        brains, as his neighbour obviously was, should waste his valuable time\n        with profligate women, who might present him with a nice dose to last him\n        his <span data-edition=\"ed1986\" data-page=\"535\"> </span>lifetime. In \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1922\" data-page=\"609\"> </span>\n        the nature of single blessedness he would one day take\n        unto himself a wife when Miss Right came on the scene but in the interim\n        ladies' society was a <i>conditio sine qua non</i> though he had the gravest\n        possible doubts, not that he wanted in the smallest to pump Stephen\n        about Miss Ferguson (who was very possibly the particular lodestar who\n        brought him down to <Annotation annotationId=\"030015irishtown\">Irishtown</Annotation> so early in the morning), as to whether he\n        would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea\n        and the company of smirking misses without \n        a penny to their names bi- or\n        tri-weekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of <span data-edition=\"ed1932\" data-page=\"563\"> </span>complimentpaying and\n        walking out leading up to fond lovers' ways and flowers and chocs. To\n        think of him house and homeless, rooked by some landlady worse than any\n        stepmother, was really too bad at his age. The queer suddenly things\n        he popped out with attracted the elder man who was several years the\n        other's senior or like his father.

At his age when dabbling in politics roughly\n        some score of years previously when he had been a <i>quasi</i> aspirant to\n        parliamentary honours in the Buckshot Foster days he too recollected in\n        retrospect (which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself) he had\n        a sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas. For instance, when the\n        evicted tenants question, then at its first inception, bulked largely in\n        people's mind though, it goes <span data-edition=\"ed1961\" data-page=\"656\"> </span>without \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1939\" data-page=\"461\"> </span>\n        saying, not contributing a copper\n        or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums, some of which wouldn't\n        exactly hold water, he at the outset in principle at all events was in\n        thorough sympathy with peasant possession, as voicing the trend of modern\n        opinion, a partiality, however, which, realising his mistake, he was\n        subsequently partially cured of, and even was twitted with going a\n        step farther than Michael Davitt in the striking views he at one time\n        inculcated as a backtothelander, which was one reason he strongly\n        resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1922\" data-page=\"610\"> </span>\n        at the gathering of the clans in Barney Kiernan's so that he,\n        though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of\n        mortals, be it repeated, departed from his customary habit to give\n        him (metaphorically) one in the gizzard though, so far as politics\n        themselves were concerned, he was only too conscious of the casualties\n        invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity\n        and the misery and suffering <span data-edition=\"ed1986\" data-page=\"536\"> </span>it entailed as a foregone conclusion on\n        fine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word.\n      </p>\n      <span data-edition=\"ed1932\" data-page=\"564\"> </span>\n      <p>\n        Anyhow, upon weighing the pros and cons, getting on for one as it\n        was, it was high time to be retiring for the night. The crux was it\n        was a bit risky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue\n        (somebody having a temper of her own sometimes) and spoil the hash\n        altogether as on the night he misguidedly brought home a dog (breed\n        unknown) with a lame paw, not that the cases were either identical or\n        the reverse, though he had hurt his hand too, to Ontario Terrace, as he\n        very distinctly remembered, having been there, so to speak. On the\n        other hand it was altogether far and away too late for the Sandymount\n        or Sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which of\n        the two alternatives... Everything pointed to the fact that it behoved him\n        to avail himself to the full of the opportunity, all things considered.\n        His initial impression was that he was a bit standoffish or not over\n        effusive but it grew on him someway. For one thing he mightn't what you\n        call jump at the idea, if approached, and what mostly worried him was\n        he didn't know how to lead up to it or word it exactly, supposing he\n        did entertain the proposal, as it would afford him very great personal\n        pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some\n        wardrobe, if found suitable. At all events he wound up by concluding,\n        eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent, a cup of <Annotation annotationId=\"170006eppscocoa\">Epps's cocoa</Annotation> and\n        a shakedown for the night plus the <span data-edition=\"ed1961\" data-page=\"657\"> </span>use of a rug or two and overcoat\n        doubled into a pillow.

He infinitely preferred the sacred music of the catholic\n        church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line such as\n        those Moody and Sankey hymns or <i>Bid me to live and I will live\n        thy protestant to be</i>. He also yielded to none in his admiration of \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1939\" data-page=\"464\"> </span>\n        Rossini's <i>Stabat Mater</i>, a work simply abounding in immortal numbers,\n        in which his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy, made a hit, a veritable\n        sensation, he might safely say, greatly adding to her other laurels and\n        putting the others totally in the \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1922\" data-page=\"614\"> </span>\n        shade, in the <Annotation annotationId=\"010008jesuit\">jesuit</Annotation> fathers' <Annotation annotationId=\"100010xavier\">church\n        in upper Gardiner street</Annotation>, the sacred edifice being thronged to the\n        doors to hear her with virtuosos, or <i>virtuosi</i> rather. There was the\n        unanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and suffice it\n        to say, in a place of worship for music of a sacred character, there was\n        a generally voiced desire for an encore. On the whole, though favouring\n        preferably light opera of the <i>Don Giovanni</i> description, and <i>Martha</i>,\n        a gem in its line, he had a <i>penchant</i>, though with only a surface\n        knowledge, for the severe classical school such as Mendelssohn. And\n        talking of that, taking it for granted he knew all about the old\n        favourites, he mentioned <i>par excellence</i> Lionel's air in <span data-edition=\"ed1932\" data-page=\"568\"> </span><i>Martha,\n        M'appari</i>, which, curiously enough, he heard, or overheard, to be\n        more accurate, on yesterday, a privilege he keenly appreciated, from the\n        lips of Stephen's respected father, sung to perfection, a study of the\n        number, in fact, which made all the others take a back seat. Stephen, in\n        reply to a politely put query, said he didn't but launched\n        out into praises of Shakespeare's songs, at least of in or about that\n        period, the lutenist Dowland who lived in Fetter Lane near Gerard the\n        herbalist, who <i>anno ludendo hausi, Doulandus</i>, an instrument he was\n        contemplating purchasing from Mr Arnold Dolmetsch, whom Bloom did not quite\n        recall, though the name certainly sounded familiar, for <span data-edition=\"ed1961\" data-page=\"661\"> </span>sixtyfive guineas\n        and Farnaby and son with their <i>dux</i> and <i>comes</i> conceits and Byrd\n        (William), who played the virginals, he said, in the Queen's chapel or\n        anywhere else he found them and one Tomkins who made toys or airs and\n        John Bull.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        On the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond\n        the swing chain, a horse, dragging a sweeper, paced on the paven ground,\n        brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloom was not\n        perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to sixtyfive\n        guineas and John Bull. He inquired if it was John Bull the political\n        celebrity of that ilk, as it struck him, the two identical names, as a\n        striking coincidence.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        By the chains, the horse <Annotation annotationId=\"160007shipofthestreet\">slowly swerved</Annotation> to turn, which perceiving, Bloom,\n        who was <Annotation annotationId=\"160006icebergs\"> keeping a sharp lookout</Annotation> as usual, plucked the other's sleeve\n        gently, jocosely remarking:\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        —{\" \"}Our lives are in peril tonight.

But such\n        a good poor brute, he was sorry he hadn't a lump of sugar but, as he\n        wisely reflected, you could scarcely be prepared for <Annotation annotationId=\"160006icebergs\">every emergency\n        that might crop up</Annotation>. He was just a big nervous foolish noodly kind of a\n        horse, without a second care in the world.

But it was no animal's fault in particular if he was\n        built that way like the camel, ship of the desert, distilling grapes\n        into potheen in his hump. Nine tenths of them all could be caged or\n        trained, nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees; whale with a\n        harpoon hairpin, alligator, tickle the small of his <span data-edition=\"ed1932\" data-page=\"569\"> </span>back and he sees the\n        joke; \n        <span data-edition=\"ed1939\" data-page=\"465\"> </span>\n        chalk a circle for a rooster; tiger, my eagle eye.

myself a young boy would like me Id confuse him a little alone with\n      him if we were Id let him see my garters the new ones and make him turn\n      red looking at him seduce him I know what boys

neither\n      would he Id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar I wonder did he know\n      me in the box I could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed\n      never turn or let on still his

  incense off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if\n      youre married hes too careful about himself then give something to H{\" \"}H\n      the pope for a penance I wonder was he satisfied with me one thing I\n      didnt like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall\n      though I laughed Im not a horse or an ass am I I suppose he was thinking\n      of his father I wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am I in\n      it who gave him that flower he said <span data-edition=\"ed1932\" data-page=\"643\"></span>he bought he <span

you with that determined vicious look in his eye I had\n      to halfshut my eyes still he hasnt such a tremendous amount of spunk in\n      him when I made him pull out and do it on me considering how big it is\n      so much the better in case any of it wasnt washed out properly the last\n      time I let him finish it in me nice invention they made for women for\n      him to get all the

meeting Josie Powell and the funeral and thinking about\n      me and Boylan set him off well he can think what he likes now if thatll\n      do him <span data-edition=\"ed1986\" data-page=\"611\"></span>any good I know they were spooning a bit when I came on the scene\n      he was dancing and sitting out with her the night of Georgina Simpsons\n      housewarming and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account\n      of not liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup\n      row over politics he began it not me when he said about Our Lord being a\n      carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive about\n      everything I was <span data-edition=\"ed1961\" data-page=\"742\"></span>fuming with myself after for giving in only for I knew\n      he was gone on me and the first socialist he said He was he annoyed me\n      so much I couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot of mixedup\n      things especially about the body and the inside I often wanted to study\n      up that myself what we have inside us in that family physician I could\n      always hear his voice talking when the room was crowded and watch him\n      after that I pretended I had on a coolness on with her over him \n      <span data-edition=\"ed1922\" data-page=\"694\"></span>\n      because he\n      used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you going\n      to and I said over to Floey and he made me the present of <Annotation annotationId=\"180006lordbyron\">Byrons poems</Annotation>\n      and the three pairs of gloves so that finished that I could quite easily\n      get him to make it up any time I know how Id even supposing he got in\n      with her again and was going out to see her somewhere Id know if he\n      refused to eat the onions I know plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the\n      collar of my blouse or touch him with my veil and gloves on going out I\n      kiss then would send them all spinning however alright well see then let\n      him go to her she of course would only be too delighted to pretend shes\n      mad in love with him that I wouldnt so much mind Id just go to her and\n      ask her do you love him and look her square in the eyes she \n      <span data-edition=\"ed1939\" data-page=\"524\"> </span>\n      couldnt fool\n      me but he might imagine he was and make a declaration to her with his\n      plabbery kind of a manner like he did to me though I had the devils own\n      job to get it out of him though I liked him for that it showed he could\n      hold in and wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking\n      me too the night in the kitchen I was rolling the potato cake theres\n      something I want to say to you only for I put him off letting on I was\n      in a temper with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case I let\n      out too much the night before talking of dreams so I didnt want to let\n      him know more <span data-edition=\"ed1932\" data-page=\"645\"></span>than was good for him she used to be always embracing me\n      Josie whenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and\n      when I said I washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did\n      you wash possible the women are always egging on to that putting it on\n      thick when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on\n      the indifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what\n      spoils him I dont wonder in the least because he was very

living with that dotty husband of hers she had her\n      face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time I saw her she\n      must have been just after a row with him because I saw on the

 another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like me to\n      put up with him the way I do know me come sleep with me yes and he knows\n      that too at the bottom of his heart take
